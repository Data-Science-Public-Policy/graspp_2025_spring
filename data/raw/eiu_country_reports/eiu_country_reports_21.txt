Full text: - Olaf Scholz of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) governs as chancellor at the head of the country's first three-party federal coalition, with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and The Greens. Germany has a strongly centrist and consensus-based political culture, and EIU expects the coalition to serve its full term, to October 2025. Policymaking has tended towards unwieldy compromises to satisfy the various coalition partners. As these parties have seen their support erode, and experienced disappointments at state elections, they have become less amenable to compromise. This means that frictions and divisions will increase in 2023-25. Progress on improving Germany's defence capabilities has picked up since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but remains slow.

- Germany's score in EIU's business environment model rises from 8.14 in the historical period (2018-22) to 8.25 in the forecast period (2023-27). The country climbs three places to eighth in the global ranking, and ranks fourth among its 17 regional peers, behind Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden. We expect gradual reform-led improvements in infrastructure, technological readiness and financing, but rising protectionism globally will result in a hardening of policy towards foreign investment. Germany's main strengths are its skilled labour force, stable political culture, openness to foreign trade and investment, and research and innovation framework. Weaknesses include the tax regime, which places a heavy burden on labour income, and the worsening demographic outlook, which implies that skilled labour shortages will become more common.

- Depressed private consumption and investment spending will cause economic growth to stall this year, as real wages stagnate, still-high inflation constrains household spending, and high interest rates raise the cost of borrowing and put pressure on profit margins. Demand from the EU and the US will be lacklustre, but exports to China will strengthen as that economy experiences a post-pandemic economic bounce-back. Backlogs of work will support German industrial sector growth as global supply-chain frictions ease, and economic activity will normalise from 2024. However, Germany's poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain growth, and technological disruption in the automotive sector represents a structural risk.

- The pandemic in 2020-21 resulted in a higher death rate, lower net immigration and slightly fewer births than in 2019. The arrival of just over 1m Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine will result in a slight bump to 82.9m in 2023, before the population begins a longer-term trend of decline. As elsewhere in Europe, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period. The share of the population that is of working age in Germany dipped below that of Italy in 2018 and the UK in 2020, and is falling more swiftly than in any of the country's regional peers. This is likely to lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, and over time will exacerbate labour shortages.

- Germany will remain the world's fourth-largest economy at market exchange rates in 2027, and the biggest EU economy. It is the largest consumer market in Europe by population, but demand is constrained by a substantial tax wedge and high savings rates. We expect retail sales volumes to fall in 2023 as high inflation eats into disposable incomes, but to return to growth from 2024. Consumer demand for convenience will continue to rise, alongside demand for products that are sustainable; for ethnic, organic and local products; and for the expanding luxury segment. The share of online retail sales was boosted by the pandemic. An ageing demographic profile will increasingly shape demand.

Growth of real GDP per head 1.3 1.5 1.4

Labour productivity growth 1.3 1.7 1.6

- Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate (2023-50) is 1.2%. The poor demographic outlook is the main driver of this weakening overall growth rate; total factor productivity will remain supportive of growth, as will capital spending. The picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with average growth of 1.4%. Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and openness to innovation. Its openness to trade will ensure continued efforts to protect the multilateral trading system, but trade ties with Russia and China will decline given geopolitical tensions.

a Actual.
Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45) Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be removed only by the election of a successor. Federal coalitions are typically made up of two parties, but voter fragmentation was such in the 2021 election that the current government is the first three-party coalition at the federal level.
Policy issues: Priorities include addressing the impact of high energy prices and inflation on the cost of living; reorienting defence and security policy; managing the transition of the automotive sector towards lower-emission vehicles; building industrial sovereignty and increasing the resilience of supply chains; the rollout of fifth-generation (5G) technology and progress on the Industry 4.0 agenda; and transitioning the energy sector away from reliance on Russia over the long term. Investment spending will increase in the forecast period (2023-27).
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The solidarity tax was phased out for most income bands from 2021. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social-security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 20%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus came to US$118.6bn in 2022, down from US$230.6bn in 2021 as energy import costs soared. Germany's single largest goods export market is still the EU, but the country has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Germany is a federal democracy, with major powers delegated to the 16 states (Länder). The 2021 election marked a turning point for the political landscape as Angela Merkel stood down after 16 years as chancellor. Her party, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), performed poorly in the election, enabling the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) to lead the next government. However, with these two big-tent parties having seen a sharp decline in their vote share in recent elections, as voter preferences have fragmented and previously solid electoral blocs (such as the blue-collar vote) have dispersed, three parties were needed to reach a majority at the federal level rather than two, for the first time. The SPD therefore governs with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and The Greens, which saw a notable surge in their support. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and far-left Left Party both lost vote share compared with 2017. The bicameral parliament comprises the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), whose members are elected on a system of modified proportional representation, and the Bundesrat (the upper house), which consists of representatives of the 16 state governments. The coalition has a majority in the Bundestag, but not in the Bundesrat.

Political outlook: Political stability Olaf Scholz of the SPD governs as chancellor at the head of the country's first three-party federal coalition, with the FDP and The Greens. Germany has a strongly centrist and consensus-based political culture, and EIU expects the coalition to serve its full term, to October 2025.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a cross-party consensus around increasing energy security and defence spending-an agreement that also included the CDU. However, poll ratings for all three coalition partners have fallen owing to the war and the energy crisis. The FDP has disappointed its more right-leaning voters, who see it as enabling what is in many respects still a centre-left coalition. The SPD has been criticised for Mr Scholz's perceived indecisiveness, and The Greens have lost their initial boost in support resulting from the party's clarity relating to Russia and energy policy.
As the coalition partners have seen their support erode, and experienced disappointments at state elections, they have become less amenable to compromise. This means that frictions and divisions will increase in 2023-24. As a consequence, Mr Scholz will have to continue to focus his efforts on keeping his domestic government in line, rather than playing a significant role in European affairs-a stark change from his predecessor, Ms Merkel.
Policymaking has leaned towards unwieldy compromises to satisfy the various coalition partners, and this will remain a key characteristic of the current government. Recent examples include the use of off-balance-sheet funds to provide EUR100bn in defence spending and EUR200bn in energy price support, but without suspending the constitutional "debt brake" on deficit spending (a red line for the FDP); and the temporary extension of nuclear power to April 2023 (a compromise between the pro-nuclear FDP and the anti-nuclear Greens). This type of policymaking has already invited legal and constitutional scrutiny, and will constrain the government's ability to plan for the long term.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The quality of administration is high, and the implementation of policies that have been passed by parliament is sound. The federal structure of the government means that considerable responsibility falls on the 16 states that constitute the republic. An advantage of this is that many issues are decided with the closer democratic involvement of the electorate. States have a strong incentive to improve their own quality of governance, as comparisons with other states are easy to make, although one drawback is that the quality of public services such as education remains heterogeneous across states. Another disadvantage is that co-ordination can be difficult in policy areas in which the states have a large role. For instance, although the federal government has allocated additional funds for infrastructure investment in recent years, state governments have often been unable to use these for additional investment owing to capacity constraints. The design of the system also means that the constitutional powers enjoyed by the Bundesrat may, on occasion, limit the ability of the federal government to push through reforms in the face of opposition at state level, as state interests are represented in the Bundesrat.
A substantial majority of Germans agree that the Bundestag is too big. It has 736 members of parliament (MPs) at present, making it the largest democratically elected parliament in the world, and it is therefore expensive to run. A bill to reduce its size has been passed by the Bundestag but now faces a legal challenge at the Constitutional Court. The bill contains three key changes: a cap on the number of MPs at 630; a more proportional distribution of seats; and a stricter application of the 5% threshold for representation in parliament. If the legal challenge fails, the new, streamlined system could give the current coalition parties a better chance of staying in power.
Thorough coalition agreements support smooth policymaking, up to a point Majority coalitions are the norm in Germany at both the federal and the state levels. This generally ensures smooth policymaking, as the coalition agreement usually sets out in advance what the government will be working on throughout its term (although of course not everything can be anticipated in advance). In the case of the current three-party federal coalition, reaching this agreement involved 22 working groups, bringing together 300 politicians, and resulted in compromises and key wins for each of the parties. The consensus-oriented political culture underpins political stability, but the current federal government is finding that the need to reach compromises between the three ruling parties makes policymaking slower and less coherent than would be ideal.
Political outlook: Election watch The next federal election will be held in 2025. Opinion poll ratings for all three coalition partners have fallen owing to the war and the energy crisis. The FDP has disappointed its more right-leaning voters, who see it as enabling what is in many respects still a centre-left coalition. The SPD has been criticised for Mr Scholz's perceived indecisiveness, and The Greens have lost their initial boost in support resulting from the party's clarity relating to Russia and energy policy. The biggest beneficiary of this has been the CDU, which now leads most opinion polls, although the far-right AfD has also seen its support surge.
State elections have taken place in Bremen and Berlin thus far in 2023, the former of which led to the SPD becoming the largest party, while the latter produced a surge in support for the CDU at the expense of the SPD. However, the predictive value of these elections at the federal level is limited because the states in question are completely urban and relatively small. Two additional state elections scheduled for 2023, in Bavaria and Hesse, will provide a greater sense of the extent to which voters have been disappointed by the parties in the federal governing coalition.
A proposed electoral reform law would remove exceptions to the 5% threshold for proportional seats in order to reduce the size of the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament, currently the largest democratically elected parliament in the world). This would mean that the Left Party and the Christian Social Union (the Bavarian sister party of the CDU) would lose parliamentary representation if they failed to secure more than 5% of the national vote at the 2025 election. However, both parties have announced that they will challenge this in court.
Political outlook: International relations In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine the EU has imposed ten packages of financial and individual sanctions, closely co-ordinated with the US and other Western allies. These sanctions will remain in place throughout our forecast period and probably beyond as the West and Russia continue their economic decoupling. We expect the war in Ukraine to be a protracted conflict with no clear-cut resolution, and risks of further escalation. As the war drags on and the costs to Ukraine's Western backers increase, public support in some places may start to decline, and deliveries of military support may become less generous. However, we do not expect a change in official positions of support for Ukraine in the forecast period.
Germany's policy shift towards China will probably underwhelm. The previous doctrine of "change through trade" that had long governed German policy towards China has since been seen as naive, and new restrictions on Chinese takeovers are likely in strategic industries such as semiconductors and logistics. However, trade and investment ties will remain substantial, as illustrated by the acquisition of a stake in a Hamburg port terminal by the Chinese state-owned shipping giant Cosco in November 2022.
Germany-EU tensions-in some cases triggered by Mr Scholz's efforts to manage the conflicting demands of his coalition partners-are set to persist on issues such as government support for energy costs, defence spending and relations with China. Disputes over state aid and the green transition will intensify in 2023 as the EU formulates a policy response to match increased US spending on green industrial policy. We expect the EU to be dragged (reluctantly) into the US-China subsidy race; initial proposals suggest that this is likely to advantage Germany over smaller member states with less fiscal firepower. Negotiations over the EU's new fiscal framework are also likely to increase intra-EU tensions, with Germany one of the leading fiscal hawks.

Germany's score in EIU's business environment model rises from 8.14 in the historical period (2018-22) to 8.25 in the forecast period (2023-27). The country climbs three places to eighth in the global ranking, and ranks fourth among its 17 regional peers, behind Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden. We expect that new policy initiatives from the coalition will lead to improvements in infrastructure, technological readiness and financing, bolstered by a post-pandemic reduction in financial distortions from state intervention. This is set against lower scores for policy towards foreign investment, and foreign trade and exchange controls, which largely reflect the unstable geopolitical environment and rising protectionism globally. EU funding will support the clean energy and digital transitions, but overall we expect only a slight improvement in Germany's business environment, with progress constrained by economic headwinds, the lagged effects of previously lacklustre supply-side reforms and exposure to the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine.
Germany's main strengths are its skilled labour force, stable political culture, openness to foreign trade and investment, and a strong research and innovation framework. It has sound legal and regulatory structures, efficient public administration, and a broadly pro-business policy orientation. The financing environment appears resilient and is supportive of business, but strains could emerge in the context of markedly tighter monetary conditions (compared with the past decade). Sentiment towards foreign investment will remain broadly favourable, but tighter screening rules and a focus on "protecting" national sovereignty will dampen capital inflows. Network infrastructure is extensive, but ageing in some areas, and improvements will be gradual. The tax regime places a heavy burden on labour income, and the demographic outlook is poor, which implies an ongoing issue with skilled labour shortages.

Business environment outlook: Germany's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: Greater state intervention in the energy sector, including price caps and Uniper nationalisation. EU state aid rules still relaxed. EU eases green investment state aid rules to counter the impact of the US Inflation Reduction Act.
2025-27: Limited prospects for reforming regulated service professions. Trend towards industrial sovereignty continues.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Government generally welcomes foreign direct investment. Prospective tightening of screening rules in "strategic" sectors for non-EU capital inflows, and greater political oversight amid EU-wide pushback.
2025-27: Investment from China is increasingly unwelcome amid concerns about intellectual property leakage.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Trade surplus gradually recovers, and imported energy costs fall from record highs, but sustained higher input costs reduce industrial sector competitiveness. Semiconductor shortage gradually unwinds. Sanctions on Russian imports remain in place.
2025-27: EU makes further gradual progress on bilateral trade deals. Deterioration in EU-China relations and trade ties. Carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) instituted in 2026. Risk of escalating US-EU-China subsidy race.
Taxes 2023-24: No changes to headline rates. Scope for reform constrained by economic backdrop and coalition tensions. Modest adjustments aimed at mitigating the energy price shock, incentivising green investment and encouraging clean energy use.
2025-27: Comparatively high labour tax burden persists. Research and development (R&D) tax incentive applies until 2026.
Financing 2023-24: Financing environment for firms is fairly resilient, supported by the national development bank. Significantly tightened monetary conditions and jittery global markets will dampen activity and could expose vulnerabilities.
2025-27: Alternative financing channels remain fairly limited. Weak banking sector profitability remains an issue.
The labour market 2023-24: Unemployment remains low amid subdued economic backdrop. Modest easing of labour immigration rules, but sector-specific skills mismatches and labour shortages will persist.
2025-27: Policy focus on raising labour participation to counter structural challenges arising from ageing demographics.
Infrastructure 2023-24: Energy transition focuses on national hydrogen strategy, power grid improvement and new liquefied natural gas terminals to reduce exposure to Russia. Investment in healthcare infrastructure, the transport network and digital access.
2025-27: Achieving nationwide full-coverage target for gigabit-ready broadband (by 2025) will be challenging.
Technological readiness 2023-24: Government prioritises e-public services (where coverage and quality lag many peer countries), firms' digital adoption, automotive innovation and workforce digital skills.
2025-27: Efforts continue on Industry 4.0, which focuses on upgrading manufacturing through automation and connected systems. Increasing threat from cyber-weapons. Fifth-generation (5G) network rollout supports wider digitalisation drive.

Germany has solid macroeconomic fundamentals, with a high employment rate, a track record of fiscal management, a sophisticated export-focused industrial sector, an external surplus, moderate private-sector debt (by regional standards) and a robust institutional framework. Weaker aspects include poor medium-term trends in investment and infrastructure spending (partly due to fiscal restraint), a shrinking working-age population, overvalued property sectors in some cities, and low labour productivity growth. The category score is unchanged. However, we expect a slight deterioration in Germany's global ranking over the forecast period, reflecting the lagged effects of lacklustre supply-side reforms in the past decade in labour supply, digital transformation, network infrastructure and start-up financing. Higher living costs and commodity prices, tighter financing conditions, geopolitical tensions, and a more protectionist external trading environment will also constrain growth.
Germany's heavy historical reliance on Russian gas has proved a vulnerability Despite a less severe downturn over the pandemic than in most peer countries-amid extensive policy support and structural advantages-Germany's recovery since 2022 has lagged the regional average and trailed far behind that of the US. This largely reflects Germany's relatively high exposure to disrupted global trading conditions and supply chains, and its previously high reliance on Russian gas exports. Germany has made good progress in diversifying its energy supplies, but it will take time for badly affected industries, such as the energy-intensive chemicals sector, to recover. Industrial sector competitiveness will be weakened by sustained higher input costs (especially for energy), and subsidy-driven competition for investment with the US will add to structural pressures, particularly in the large automotive sector. Skilled labour shortages will limit growth potential in certain industries.

Germany will continue to offer an attractive environment for private enterprise, albeit with more restricted services competition and more complex sectoral regulation than in some peer countries. The category score and regional ranking remain unchanged in the forecast period. Increased state involvement in the economy in response to the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war will not be fully reversed. Private enterprise is supported by a robust institutional structure, a stable legal code, strong research and innovation capacity, and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. The competition authority, the Federal Cartel Office, is reasonably efficient. The regulatory framework can be complex and costly, but is robust and generally transparent. Administrative processes for accessing utilities and credit, obtaining permits, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency are fairly straightforward. However, the time and costs involved to establish a new business and hire labour tend to be above the OECD average, and there are high barriers to competition in certain transport, utilities, retail and business services sectors. Tax administration can be burden-some, but online registration and value-added tax (VAT) filing has improved since the introduction of an EU One-Stop-Shop e-commerce scheme in 2021.
State interventionism has increased since 2022, and is set to be maintained
- The cut-off of Russian gas has led to increased state intervention in the energy sector. This has involved subsidies, price caps, fuel tax cuts and a EUR50bn bailout (and de facto nationalisation) in late 2022 of Uniper, a power utility. The state will maintain a higher level of involvement in the economy and the energy sector in particular in 2023-27, given ongoing energy diversification efforts and as part of longer-term green-transition climate policies. This will accompany a broader shift towards greater industrial sovereignty and support for "strategically important" domestic firms.
- A temporary suspension of EU state aid rules during the pandemic has been partially rolled back since mid-2022, but investment and solvency support measures will continue until at least 2024. Regional tensions over state aid and the green transition are likely to intensify in 2023-24 as the EU implements a policy response to increased US spending on green industrial policy under its Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The European Commission has proposed easing state aid restrictions for "investments in renewable energy and decarbonising industry" to counteract the impact of the IRA, which risks diverting investment in green technologies away from the EU by providing tax credits and subsidies for North America-based production. The initial proposals are likely to advantage Germany over smaller member states with less fiscal firepower. The issue of region-specific subsidies and policies relating to green investment will be a source of tension between the EU, the US and China over the forecast period.
- There is a moderate level of state ownership in the economy. The federal government's major holdings include Deutsche Bahn (100%); Uniper (99%); the former telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom (32%); the former postal monopoly, Deutsche Post (21%); and the country's second-largest financial institution, Commerzbank (16%). The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which controls the Ministry of Finance, campaigned on a platform of reducing state ownership, but, given policy divisions within the three-party coalition and the relatively weak economic outlook, we do not expect major sell-offs of high-profile government stakes in the near to medium term.

Policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) is fairly liberal (as in most EU countries), and Germany will remain a major destination for inward investment in 2023-27, given its economic size and solid business environment. However, FDI activity will be constrained by stricter monitoring rules, a weak economy and heightened global subsidy competition to attract clean energy investment. FDI screening procedures have been tightened considerably in recent years, especially for investors linked to China, amid hardened political sentiment towards capital inflows in "strategic" and "security-sensitive" sectors. This trend has been reinforced by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, which have fostered a global shift towards greater regionalisation and more protectionist trade and investment policies. The monitoring framework has broadened significantly into additional sectors, leading to a marked rise in the share of prospective FDI transactions subject to official review. This more interventionist stance and a more complex regulatory process for investors are reflected in falls in the category score and rankings in 2023-27. Specific nation-wide limitations on foreign ownership or control apply only in a few sectors such as media, defence and infrastructure. Restrictions on hostile takeovers are considerable, whether the acquirer is foreign or domestic; notice of strategic goals and "acting in concert" is mandatory for large investments. Foreign and domestic investors are treated equally in terms of investment incentives (with a focus on support for research and innovation) and protection of real and intellectual property. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) is the federal body responsible for FDI, with the state-owned development bank, KfW, the main provider of financing support. Production of semiconductors and electric-vehicle (EV) batteries are among the focus areas for attracting FDI, and two major subsidy-backed investments, from Intel (US) and Northvolt (Sweden), were reportedly close to being agreed as at June 2023.
Scrutiny of FDI transactions will continue to intensify
- Germany was a strong advocate of an EU-wide framework for stricter monitoring of non-EU FDI-which was implemented in 2020-21-and in recent years has progressively tightened the country's investment screening legislation and broadened its scope of application. This follows a period of increased Chinese (and other foreign) acquisitions of German firms, prompting concerns over the transfer of intellectual property and involvement of state-backed foreign actors in sensitive high-tech sectors and critical infrastructure assets. Historically, the government had the power to review (and veto) new investment projects or acquisitions of equity stakes above 25% in German companies by non-EU investors if the transactions were deemed to pose a risk to national security. The most severe threshold is now 10% for investments deemed to fall within a significantly expanded range of "critical" sectors (and which trigger a mandatory review), with less onerous thresholds of 20-25% dependent on the specific industry and investor. The interpretation of "national security risk" has also been broadened, including the potential impact on other EU member states. Mandatory reviews are now more likely for most FDI transactions relating to energy, telecommunications, transport, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, robotics, semiconductors, food security and raw material extraction. Scrutiny of FDI activity is expected to be tightened further over the forecast period and will probably become gradually more politicised.

A high category score reflects Germany's traditional openness to international commerce, the importance to the economy of foreign trade and the country's membership of the EU, which provides for freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons within the bloc. The score declines slightly for 2023-27, reflecting exposure to what is likely to be a more unstable geopolitical environment and an underlying deterioration in trading conditions, amid increased protectionism and regionalisation, lower FDI activity, tighter bilateral controls on technology, and a deterioration in West-China relations. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU, and most other non-tariff restrictions have been abolished. The EU trades with Norway and Iceland under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and has a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland, a customs union with Turkey and a limited free-trade agreement (FTA) with the UK. Agriculture is excluded from these arrangements. Trade with other non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. Bilateral and regional agreements provide for lower or zero tariffs and co-operation on non-tariff barriers.

- Supply-chain frictions will diminish in 2023, but headwinds will persist in the form of ongoing inflationary pressures, tighter financing conditions and geopolitical tensions. At the regional level, the EU will seek to bolster production and supply-chain resilience in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, biotech, semiconductors and EV batteries over the forecast period. However, industrial competitiveness will be weakened by sustained higher input costs (especially energy) and will also come under strain from the US's IRA clean energy subsidy programme. Amid fears that the IRA will divert investment from Europe-Germany's automotive industry is among the more exposed sectors-the EU is likely to respond with its own package of green incentives, marking a renewed global subsidy race with the US (and Asia). This shift will pose new challenges in EU-US trade relations. We assume that US-EU ties will remain firm in 2023 as shared geopolitical concerns (mainly over Russia and China) overshadow bilateral trade tensions, but this dynamic could shift over time, particularly after the 2024 US presidential election. Europe's push for "strategic autonomy" will prevent uniformity in a transatlantic approach towards China.

A deterioration in EU-China relations is likely
- EU-China tensions have risen over recent years as China has come to be viewed more as a systemic rival, with the EU adopting a tougher approach on human rights abuses, investment screening and an effort to "derisk" economic ties. Amid US pressure on "like-minded governments" for tighter alignment on trade and investment restrictions relating to China, we expect a deterioration in EU-China ties in 2023-27. Developments in recent years have exposed the naivety of Germany's long-standing efforts to enact "change through trade" in its relations with authoritarian states. The government is working to elaborate a new China strategy, although any decoupling will be gradual given Germany's substantial trade and economic links with China. A likely shift will see firms adopt "China plus one" supply-chain strategies, amid a compliance burden of heightened sanctions. Pressure on countries to choose a side between China and the US will be a major trade and geopolitical theme over the forecast period.
- In recent years the EU has finalised FTAs with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and the UK, upgraded its deals with Mexico and Chile, and launched trade talks with Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. We expect the EU to make gradual progress on bilateral trade deals over the forecast period. The current limited scope of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), especially in services trade, will slowly expand and evolve, as economic realities force a less confrontational stance from the UK government in relations with the bloc (there has been some evidence of this since early 2023). However, the competitive market and regulatory environment implied by the UK's third-country status means that EU-UK tensions will persist.

The tax regime remains one of the weaker areas of Germany's business environment, and, with only minor changes expected, the country falls back in the global and regional rankings over the forecast period. Complexity will remain an issue, with taxes levied at the federal, state and municipal level. As in most peer countries, the tax/GDP ratio has trended higher in recent years and stood at 42.4% in 2021 (latest comparable Eurostat data), similar to the euro zone average. Taken together, direct taxes on personal income and net social-security contributions (labour taxes) account for a higher than average share of tax receipts. A progressive income tax system levies rates ranging from 14% to 42% on taxable income between EUR10,632 and EUR61,971 (in 2023). The 42% rate applies to income up to EUR277,825, above which there is a 45% top rate. An additional "solidarity surcharge"-a 5.5% levy on income to finance reunification costs-was abolished for most taxpayers in 2021, with a tapered scale for higher earners. Most employees pay social-security contributions into insurance funds covering pensions, healthcare, unemployment and long-term care. Contribution rates range from 18.6% of gross salary (split between employees and employer) for pensions to about 3% for long-term care and unemployment insurance. The standard VAT rate is 19%, slightly less than the EU average, with a reduced rate of 7% on certain goods and services.
A fairly complex corporate tax regime will constrain new investment
- The tax system places a relatively high tax burden on labour income and companies. In 2022 the average single worker faced a tax wedge of 47.8%, the second highest in the OECD. Those with children have a lower, but still above-average, tax wedge. This high burden particularly affects low-income workers and acts as a disincentive for second earners, contributing to Germany's modest full-time employment rate for women. The effective tax burden for companies is also elevated, despite a comparatively low headline federal corporation tax rate of 15%. Including a local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and other levies, the effective average corporation tax rate is about 30%, against an EU average of about 21%. Tax incentives are rare, but a EUR1m annual allowance for certain research and development (R&D) activities will apply until 2026. A temporary windfall tax will be levied on electricity producers until mid-2023 and could be extended until April 2024. The overall corporate tax regime is not particularly supportive of new business investment, especially among smaller firms and start-ups. It will remain fairly complex, contributing to high compliance costs and favouring debt over equity, constraining the venture capital market.
- Given the subdued economic backdrop, Germany's long-standing fiscal hawkishness and a coalition agreement (stipulated by the FDP) not to raise headline tax rates, reform measures will be limited. Some modest changes to the corporate tax framework are likely from 2024 that could include more generous rules for depreciation and partnerships, and incentives for firms that invest in climate protection. A carbon pricing system was introduced in 2021 and is likely to be gradually amended, as part of a broader "carrot and stick" approach to climate-related tax measures aimed at influencing transport use and energy efficiency. EV subsidies were cut in 2023 and will be largely phased out by end-2024. Developments at the EU level, such as the bloc's proposed Green Deal Industrial Plan (a response to the US IRA), are likely to play a significant role in shaping firms' climate-related investment plans over the forecast period.
- Other tax plans include a tightening of rules covering the real estate transfer tax (RETT), a further strengthening of measures to combat tax fraud and evasion (following on from the implementation in mid-2021 of the EU's Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive-ATAD), and greater digitalisation of the tax administration. A reform of property tax is due to take effect from 2025 (the current system is based on values dating from the 1960s), although a delay is possible amid issues with the revaluation process and the politically contentious nature of the reform (given the probable rise in property taxes).

Financial stability indicators appear robust, despite recent market jitters The financing environment has been resilient amid the economic shocks of recent years, supported by the stabilising effects of substantial policy support, a fairly competitive banking sector and the prominent role of the KfW (the largest national development bank in Europe). As at May 2023, bank capital levels and liquidity coverage were above regulatory minimums, and there was a low level of non-performing loans (NPLs). The higher category score in the forecast period largely reflects a post-pandemic reduction in financial distortions from state intervention. Vulnerabilities mainly stem from structurally low bank profitability (among the weakest in the EU), modest revenue growth and elevated operating costs. Net interest income is rising amid tightened monetary policy, but operating conditions will remain challenging amid ripple effects from the war in Ukraine, subdued economic growth, the unwinding of central bank stimulus (quantitative tightening) and jittery financial markets. The banking system has a three-tiered structure, with large private commercial banks (the two biggest are Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank) and the state-owned regional lenders (Landesbanken) operating alongside an extensive network of local credit co-operatives and public-sector savings banks (owned by local authorities) that primarily service the Mittelstand (small and medium-sized enterprises-SMEs). Alongside the KfW, this offers a range of financing options, but also contributes to downward pressure on banking margins. Internally generated funds account for an above-average share of corporate financing, reflecting firms' low reliance on capital markets. Bank credit is the preferred SME funding channel, being relatively cheap and available at long maturities. Venture capital markets have expanded only slowly and are less developed than in most large high-income countries. Availability of early- and late-stage growth capital for start-ups and smaller firms remains fairly restrictive, amid limited state-backed support measures.

- Financial sector balance sheets appear fairly resilient, and instability risks are generally low. However, there is a risk that fragile linkages between banks and other parts of the financial sector could be exposed by tighter and more volatile financing conditions in 2023-27 than in the past decade, as well as structurally higher inflation. Excessive interest-rate exposure, impaired debt-servicing capacity or a sudden shift in wider financial market sentiment (similar to the market turmoil in the US and Switzerland in March 2023) could trigger more strained liquidity conditions, pushing up bank funding costs and restricting credit availability.

We expect a gradual cooling of the real estate market, but some risks remain
- Vulnerabilities in the German residential and commercial real estate sectors increased steadily over the historical period, in the context of rising investor activity, low borrowing costs, constrained housing supply, loosened credit standards and pandemic-driven changes in property demand. Real estate prices rose strongly, particularly in major cities, with prices in some segments appearing to be increasingly misaligned from fundamentals. Higher interest rates and cost-of-living pressures will dampen mortgage demand in 2023 and drive a slight correction in property prices, but underlying imbalances will persist. The banking sector is not overly exposed to the property market, but a larger than expected asset-price correction, amid higher debt-servicing costs, could trigger instability. Stricter bank capital buffer rules linked to domestic residential housing loans are being phased in over 2022-23, and a modest tightening of macroprudential measures for borrowers is likely.

Germany's labour market boasts a skilled and reasonably productive workforce, low unemployment, defined employer-employee relations, a statutory national minimum wage, and a well-established framework of vocational training and apprenticeships. Solid labour market indicators before the pandemic, and a resilient performance since 2020, can be traced in part to liberalising reforms implemented by previous governments. However, some aspects hold down the score. Unit labour costs and average living costs are comparatively high. Participation of women in full-time employment is modest, constrained by limited childcare availability (despite reforms since 2017) and tax disincentives for second earners. There is a large gap between employment rates of female EU and non-EU nationals (more so than for men), implying transition issues into the labour market. The share of low-skilled, low-wage employment in the economy has risen steadily. The proportion of information and communication technology (ICT) specialists is slightly above the regional average but lags demand, constraining the pace of digital transformation. Employment prospects (and the participation rate) of older workers have improved, but a declining working-age population implies labour supply challenges and skills shortages.
The labour force will contract absent large-scale immigration
- Germany's short-time work scheme (Kurzarbeit) played an important role in shielding the labour market during the pandemic (many countries implemented similar wage-subsidy programmes), limiting job losses and allowing companies to retain workers with firm-specific skills, mitigating the costs associated with lay-offs and future hiring and training. However, the labour force still contracted, with groups already disadvantaged in the labour market-such as young workers, the lower skilled, women and foreign nationals-disproportionately affected owing to the nature of the lockdowns. Encouragingly, there has been a more concerted policy focus over recent years on programmes aimed at better integrating these groups into the labour market, although their impact will be only gradual. A recent influx of approximately 1m immigrants due to the conflict in Ukraine will provide a near-term boost to labour supply. The government has set out plans for more flexible work-time schemes, and an easing of relatively complex worker immigration rules is expected to be approved by mid-2023. More measures will be needed over the forecast period aimed at increasing labour participation to counter demographic trends.

Infrastructure is well developed, but in some instances badly maintained Network infrastructure is extensive and reliable, but weak capital investment over the past decade has led to a gradual deterioration in quality, constrained the pace of digital transformation and raised capacity concerns in the energy transition policy (Energiewende) around renewables. Transport infrastructure is well developed, but years of spending restraint have heightened road congestion and repair backlogs, with poor co-ordination between the different levels of government delaying high-speed rail projects and the planned Fehmarn Belt link with Denmark. Germany has extensive fourth generation (4G) mobile coverage and compares well for "5G-readiness" and the rollout of its 5G network. Broadband availability and pricing are fairly good in a regional context, amid recent progress in expanding network coverage of ultra-fast services. However, speeds are only around the EU average and well below the world's top-performing countries. Availability of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband connections is limited and far below the EU average.

- We expect an improvement in network infrastructure over the forecast period, with upgraded public investment plans (supported by EU grants) targeted towards digital connectivity and skills, decarbonisation, hydrogen technology, the EV sector, and rail network modernisation. However, the immense scale and disruptive impact of the green and digital transitions imply only a gradual pace of change, with progress likely to be constrained by the fallout from the war in Ukraine (in the form of structurally higher energy costs and the need to focus on cost-of-living issues), regulatory hurdles such as complex planning rules and funding difficulties (the green investment push will require significant private-sector investment).
- Accelerated plans for FTTH rollout, ongoing 5G network builds and targeted policy support (including EU grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility-RRF) will bring gradual improvements in full-fibre availability and further narrow an urban-rural digital divide. However, achieving nationwide full-coverage targets for gigabit-ready broadband (by 2025) and full-fibre access (by 2030) will be challenging.

Germany scores well for technological readiness, owing to the scope of its digital infrastructure, fairly strong e-commerce and e-business penetration, a national Industry 4.0 initiative aimed at supporting digital manufacturing, an above-average share of ICT specialists, and a well-developed framework for research and innovation. Weaker aspects are the comparatively slow pace of ultrafast broadband rollout, modest digital adoption (and innovation activity) by SMEs, below-average basic digital skills levels, and below-par scope and quality of e-government services. Investment in R&D was 3.1% of GDP in 2021, one of the highest ratios in the EU. R&D intensity has trended gradually higher over the past decade, driven primarily by large firms in medium- and high-tech manufacturing (the EV shift in the automotive industry has been a major driver). An official target is to raise total R&D investment to 3.5% of GDP by 2025. In recent years Germany has slipped from being an "innovation leader" to a "strong innovator" on the European Commission's Innovation Scoreboard. Germany scores well for business investment and public-private linkages, but lags its peers in entrepreneurship and financing support. Berlin, the capital, is the hub for entrepreneurial dynamism in Germany, but national indicators of innovative high-growth firms, start-up activity and SME innovations have weakened over recent years. Germany has a National Cyber Response Centre, and updated its cyber-security strategy in 2021. According to the Global Cyber-security Index from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Germany ranks 13th for its commitment and capacity to deal with cybercrime and cyber-espionage.
Increasing digitalisation, especially among SMEs, will be an area of focus
- There will be a policy focus in 2023-27 on bolstering digital adoption by SMEs, supporting digitalisation of automotive production, improving the quality of e-government services (particularly in the health system, and by harmonising infrastructure across the federal, state and municipal levels), and increasing the share of ICT specialists in the workforce. Funding will be supported by RRF grants, which will also be directed to EU-wide initiatives in microelectronics and next-generation cloud infrastructure.
- The 5G rollout will support increasing digitalisation by companies and the state in areas such as cloud services, data analytics, smart city applications, digital payments and AI solutions. Constraining factors will be labour shortages, data privacy issues, rising geopolitical tensions over technology regulation and competition, and increasing cyber-security risks.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government has enacted many of its initial social policy priorities, including liberalisation of abortion and drug laws, a pending easing of immigration laws, and a compromise on welfare reform provisions. However, its planned programme of investment and modernisation has been largely superseded by the priorities of the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis. Public investment has focused on energy infrastructure, including the expedited construction of several liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, the acceleration of new renewable power construction and the reactivation of several mothballed coal plants. Longer-term investment plans around the transition to electric vehicles and digitalisation have slowed. A compromise climate bill has led to greater investment and expedited permit processing for renewable infrastructure and mass transit, but has also weakened sectoral targets for decarbonisation. Efforts to boost defence spending have so far underwhelmed, but are set to accelerate.
The Zeitenwende (turning point) in defence spending promised by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is taking time to show results. Military spending and arms deliveries to Ukraine ramped up only slowly in 2022, with lengthy bureaucratic procedures and difficulties in shifting mindsets among senior decision-makers holding back change. The new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, who took office in January, is reorganising defence procurement to speed this up, but has warned that existing gaps in supplies will endure until at least 2030. The publication of the government's new National Security Strategy, scheduled for early 2023, has been delayed until mid-June, reflecting disagreements within the governing parties on how the direction of foreign policy should change.
The government's fiscal plan to 2025 foresees significantly higher capital investment in artificial intelligence, the rollout of 5G mobile technology and innovation in the automotive industry. Boosting electric-vehicle and semiconductor production capacity will be priorities, with the shift away from internal-combustion-engine vehicles set to present major disruption to manufacturers. Additional spending will also include funding for healthcare, education, child care, the energy transition and boosting industrial sovereignty for systemically important areas. The state-owned investment bank, KfW, is likely to play a major role in financing these initiatives.

Historically, Germany has had a prudent fiscal policy, bolstered by the constitutional debt brake, which limits annual borrowing to 0.35% of GDP in normal circumstances outside recessions or national emergencies, keeping its debt/GDP ratio manageable. However, in recent years the government has used off-balance-sheet vehicles to get around the constraints of the debt brake. The most significant of these at present are EUR100bn in investment for the armed forces, and the EUR200bn "defence shield" to protect households and industry from high gas prices. The latter initiative has measures running to end-April 2024, including a "gas price brake" that fixes the price of 80% of the typical gas usage of households and small and medium-sized firms, and 70% for large industrial firms-supporting essential usage while also incentivising cutbacks.
With energy costs having moderated, it is unclear how much of this EUR200bn fund will need to be spent. The latest projections from the Ministry of Finance suggest that the 2023 deficit could therefore range from 4.25% of GDP (if all is used) to 1.25% (with none). EIU's forecast is for a shortfall equivalent to 2.5% of GDP in 2023, narrowing thereafter to close to balance by 2027. Major revenue-raising reforms are unlikely during this parliamentary term, given that the coalition agreement committed to no tax rises at the insistence of the FDP.
We expect public debt to decline from 66.3% of GDP in 2022 to 63.5% at end-2027. Over the longer term, changing the debt brake is unlikely, as it would require a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, and there is limited political appetite for repeal. However, the continued creation of off-balance-sheet funds may undermine the integrity of the official budgeting process, and is already resulting in legal and constitutional scrutiny.

The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its interest rates by another 25 basis points at its most recent monetary policy meeting, in May, as it expects euro zone inflation to remain above its 2% target until 2025. Following a cumulative 375-basis-point increase in policy rates since July 2022, we expect another 25-basis-point rise in both June and July, with the deposit rate settling at 3.75% and the main refinancing rate at 4.25% by July 2023. Headline inflation eased to 6.1% in May, from 7% in April, and underlying price pressures also eased. However, Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, said in early June that there was no clear evidence that core inflation had peaked and pledged to raise interest rates further to bring inflation down to its 2% target "in a timely manner". On the assumption that annual inflation slows more significantly in 2024, we expect the ECB to start easing monetary policy from the second half of that year, with the main refinancing rate likely to settle at about 1.75% in 2026-27.
Households and businesses will continue to face a sharp rise in borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions in the near term. Higher interest rates will dampen private consumption and push up costs for firms, which will also reduce investment. Business bankruptcies will tick up in 2023 as a result. The risk of a liquidity crisis in the euro zone is low, and the ECB would intervene if such a scenario were to materialise. Ms Lagarde has reassured the markets that the bank is ready to "respond as necessary" to preserve financial stability in the euro area.

High energy costs, inflation and tightening monetary policy pushed Germany into a mild technical recession over the winter of 2022/23. Industrial production declined modestly, especially in the most energy-intensive sectors, although the rest of the industrial sector was effective in substituting away from gas. Consumer and business confidence remained depressed, and, along with a pull-back in government spending, this led to an overall decline in GDP.
We expect Germany to register weak quarterly growth for the remainder of the year as declining energy prices and increased industrial demand from China support the industrial sector. However, private consumption will remain weak, driven by stagnant real wages, still-high inflation and rising interest rates, while demand from the EU and US markets for German exports will remain subdued. Despite the return to quarterly growth, we expect a full-year GDP contraction of 0.2% for 2023, making Germany the worst-performing G7 economy and the only one for which we forecast a full-year contraction this year.
We expect still-elevated energy prices and tight monetary policy to result in a period of slow growth until mid-2024. The main downside risk is that monetary tightening continues for longer than we expect in 2023. Our core forecast is for 1.3% growth next year, strengthening to an average of 1.4% in 2025-27. Over the longer term, Germany's poor demographic outlook will constrain potential growth as the working-age population declines.
With gas prices set to remain higher in Europe than their historical norms over the medium term, Germany's cost competitiveness will fall in gas- and energy-intensive sectors. For some firms (particularly in the chemicals and metals sectors), this means that producing in Europe will no longer be a profitable business strategy. BASF, Germany's biggest chemicals firm, has announced that it will permanently downsize its European operations, while developing a EUR10bn plant in China. Technological disruption in the automotive sector also represents a structural risk: Germany has been slow to shift towards electric vehicles, and the supply chains for such vehicles require fewer manufactured components (of which Germany is a world leader) and more scarce raw materials. However, Germany's long-established advantages as an attractive business environment at the heart of Europe mean that the country will still retain significant advantages in industrial production, even though its global share of energy-intensive industries is set to decline.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Services account for about 70% of GDP, industry for almost 30% and agriculture less than 1%. The share of industry in the German economy exceeds those of all the other major economies in Europe, with the UK and France at roughly 20%, and even Italy at only 25%. This proved an advantage for Germany during the pandemic in 2020-21, as industrial production was less disrupted by social-distancing restrictions than contact-intensive services. However, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany's large industrial sector-and historic dependence on Russian gas to fuel this-has come to represent a vulnerability. High energy costs have made energy-intensive sectors, such as chemicals, less competitive on the world stage. We expect Germany's economy to strengthen as energy costs continue to moderate over our forecast period, but in the short term it will continue to underperform those of its peers in western Europe.
The automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition Germany's most important manufacturing sectors are automotive; electrical and mechanical engineering; chemicals; and food, drink and tobacco. Germany is the global leader in the production of premium cars, an industry that has benefited from robust competition between several domestic companies, ownership structures that have enabled firms to make long-term investments, and a host of innovative supplier companies in the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Cluster effects are significant, and Germany's industrial champions increasingly provide value added through services supplied in conjunction with manufactured products.
The automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles, having historically invested heavily in diesel technology and entered the electric market comparatively late. This transition will be particularly disruptive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that produce intermediate components for the carmaking sector, as electric motors require far fewer components than internal-combustion engines, with the most significant component being the battery. A Tesla (US) gigafactory that opened in March 2022 outside Berlin, the capital, was built in an exceptionally fast 22 months, and will produce batteries as well as electric cars. Northvolt (Sweden) is also planning to build a lithium-ion battery gigafactory in northern Germany, to be financed by subsidies under the EU's answer to the US's green subsidy plan, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, China will continue to dwarf Europe's lithium battery production capacity, and Chinese electric vehicles will present an increasingly robust competitive challenge.
China is Germany's second-largest export market, and trade and investment ties with China are more substantial for Germany than for any other EU country. As such, Germany's efforts to shift towards a tougher stance on China, in line with the EU's policy of derisking, have so far underwhelmed. The sale in October 2022 of a stake in the port of Hamburg-Germany's largest port and the third busiest in the EU-to a Chinese investor was particularly controversial. The Greens and the FDP are in favour of tougher restrictions on trade and investment deals with China, and US pressure will be in the same direction, but Mr Scholz will aim to keep change gradual, to protect German industry.
Most industries derive competitive advantages from Germany's well-developed system of vocational training, good physical infrastructure and research base, and a tax system that encourages capital investment. Fiscal stimulus measures targeted towards infrastructure improvements, the green and digital transitions, and energy security will continue to support the construction sector, although consumer demand is moderating in the face of rising interest rates.
The pandemic has had an asymmetric impact on the services sector The services sector is the largest component of GDP and comprises a broad range of activities, from retailing to financial services, logistics and healthcare. Many of the changes prompted by the pandemic-more remote working, less business travel, a rise in e-commerce at the expense of bricks-and-mortar retailers-will endure throughout our forecast period. The financial services sector is important in Germany, but at 3.2% of GDP in 2022 it is smaller relative to the size of the economy than in the US, the UK and Japan (and below the EU average of 3.8%). It coped well with the economic shocks from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, aided by extensive monetary and fiscal support, as well as reforms and restructuring over the past decade. Capital levels and liquidity coverage are well above regulatory minimums, but conditions will remain challenging in the coming years amid a sluggish economy, tighter financing conditions, firmer price pressures and a softer housing market.

We forecast that inflation will ease from an average of 8.7% in 2022 to 6% in 2023, owing to the combination of stabilising energy prices, depressed demand as economic growth slows and base effects as the rapid commodity price increases in 2022 move out of the year-earlier comparison period. However, prices will remain elevated in historical terms. Moreover, the end of zero-covid protocols in China may boost producer price inflation in Germany via additional global demand for commodities later this year. Greater stability in energy prices as new LNG supply infrastructure comes online, alongside tighter monetary policy and weaker consumer demand, will pull inflation down to an average of 2.5% in 2024. Price growth will stabilise at 2% per year on average in 2025-27.

After the euro depreciated sharply against the US dollar in 2022, the single currency appreciated again in early 2023, reaching a 14-month high in early May. This was the result of declining energy prices, an improving economic outlook and still-strong inflation data in the euro zone, which point to further tightening by the ECB (we expect the ECB to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in both June and July). We expect that the euro will appreciate slightly against the dollar in the remainder of 2023 as the interest-rate differential between the ECB and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) narrows further. The euro:dollar exchange rate will reach US$1.14:EUR1 at year-end (a 6.5% appreciation from end-2022). Over the medium term, the value of the euro will continue to be supported by the euro zone's current-account surplus.

The higher cost of imported energy and a slowdown in industrial output reduced Germany's trade surplus to a multi-year low in 2022-at almost half its value in 2021. We expect that the current-account surplus will expand only slightly in 2023, to 4.4% of GDP, as energy prices decline, reducing import costs. We expect it to rebound further in 2024 as exports strengthen. Germany's current-account surpluses will still be supported by large primary income surpluses, owing to the country's substantial domestic savings, most of which are invested abroad. We forecast that the current-account surplus will stabilise in 2025-27 at an average of 5.5% of GDP.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Germany Stocks and flows Germany is an attractive destination for foreign investment, but the country's role as an exporter of long-term capital is more important: it is the fourth-largest investor in the world. The skills of its workforce, the availability of supplier companies, the quality of the research and innovation framework, and a reliable administrative and legal environment make Germany one of the most attractive global destinations for inward foreign direct investment (FDI). However, relative to GDP, the stock of such investment is lower than in some comparatively sized economies. Following a significant increase in inflows during the 1990s, the rate of growth of FDI slowed, falling below the world average, and outflows have exceeded inflows since 2004-with the exception of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the progress of investment deals. By 2022 FDI flows had normalised, albeit with outflows (at EUR178.9bn) much healthier than inflows (at EUR47.4bn). At end-2022 the inward FDI stock was EUR2.1trn, or 52.2% of GDP; the outward FDI stock was EUR3.2trn, or 79.6% of GDP.
Origin and distribution About two-thirds of Germany's inward FDI stock originates from other EU member states-although this sometimes includes investment from outside the EU that is transferred through countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg, often for tax reasons. The most important investor from outside the EU is the US, which accounts for 12% of the total stock. The US was responsible for the largest number of greenfield and expansion projects in 2022, at 279, and also for the largest single investment-a EUR17bn deal by Intel (US) to build a "mega fab" chip manufacturing plant in Magdeburg, which will benefit from subsidies under the EU's European Chips Act. Authorities and companies have become increasingly hesitant about increasing investment from China (which amounts to just over 1% of the FDI stock), which often targets mid-sized companies with significant technological know-how. This is likely to weigh on investment from China in the coming years, given new investment screening measures at the EU level. Most outward investment is to other EU countries, but investment in Switzerland, the US, Russia and China is also significant. However, exposure to Russia is now a vulnerability, and German firms have massively disinvested from the country since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Determinants Germany's attractiveness as an investment location stems from its robust institutional framework, stable legal code, strong research and innovation capacity, and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. The country also has good infrastructure, a number of innovative high-tech clusters and a high-quality workforce. Labour costs are among the highest in the world, but compare strongly with European peers owing to a lengthy period of wage restraint. Germany Trade and Invest is the first point of contact for foreign investors, and provides details about recent trends and growing areas of demand-information and communication technology (ICT) and software was the most dynamic area of inward investment in 2022 (22% of total deals), followed by business and financial services (21%). Foreign investors, including private equity firms, are attracted by the large number of profitable medium-sized companies specialising in niche markets. Regulations such as the right of worker representatives to sit on company boards (up to half of board members) have deterred some foreign investors, but in practice the system of workforce representation in companies often helps company management bodies to communicate their strategies and, where necessary, explain the need for changes in working practice-or even reduced pay in difficult circumstances. The tax environment remains, on balance, a downside.
Impact Foreign-owned companies employ about 2.5m people in Germany. Many FDI inflows take the form of acquisitions rather than greenfield investment, and hence the immediate impact on employment is not clear (and in some cases is initially negative). In industry, especially manufacturing, the dominance of German firms means that FDI has had only a limited impact. Foreign investment in Germany's services has had a larger impact on the domestic economy, boosting productivity via the introduction of new technology and fewer hierarchical organisational structures. Investment by private equity groups has also helped to inject capital and managerial expertise into slow-growing family-owned businesses.
Potential Germany's skilled workforce and sound infrastructure make it a good location for specialised manufacturing. More generally, the structure of German industry is still relatively fragmented, providing foreign investors with the opportunity to participate in sectoral consolidation and to reap economies of scale through acquisitions. The generational changeover at the helm of several small and medium-sized companies provides opportunities for foreign investors, although in many cases foreign involvement is not appreciated. The still-moderate level of property prices-by west European standards-and increasing demand for housing, especially in urban areas, may attract investors into this sector. A poor demographic outlook, with population growth set to stagnate and then decline, will constrain Germany's potential as a consumer market. Government screening of inward investment has increased recently and will remain high, as political pressure to protect sensitive industries has increased in recent years. This is the case across Europe, and has led to delays in approving projects and more frequent rejections of takeovers.

The population has been broadly stable since 2017, after a boost from migration Germany's population declined between 2002 and 2011, but high levels of net immigration underpinned population growth in the 2012-19 period. The population reached 82.8m in 2017 and has stabilised at about this level, up from about 80.3m in 2011, boosted in particular by the impact of the migrant crisis in 2015. The pandemic in 2020-21 resulted in a higher death rate, lower net immigration and slightly fewer births than in 2019. The arrival of just over 1m Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine will result in a slight bump to 82.9m in 2023, before the population begins a longer-term trend of decline.
The population has recorded a natural decline in every year since 1972, with the death rate higher than the birth rate, and this will continue to be the case in 2023-27. The birth rate plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, especially in the former East Germany, but more recently this trend has reversed, with the fertility rate rising to 1.6 children per woman in 2021-the highest figure since the 1970s. This reflects both policy efforts, such as an expansion in childcare provision and parental benefits, and a higher fertility rate among immigrant communities. However, this is still well below the replacement rate of 2.1, the rate needed to keep the population size constant in the absence of migration.
Population growth will depend on net immigration, given no natural growth Population growth since 1972 has come entirely from positive net immigration. This peaked in 2015 during the migrant crisis, when migrants and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa were attracted to Germany in particular because of its strong economy and initially welcoming policy stance. However, the sheer volume of arrivals soon proved politically unsustainable, prompting a hardening of the government's position. The influx of migrants slowed in 2016-17, reflecting the closing of the Balkan route into the EU and an agreement (brokered by Germany) between the EU and Turkey to stop migrants crossing into the bloc illegally from Turkey. In 2022 Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted another outflow of refugees, but the European identity and cultural similarities of these people, along with strong political support for the country's plight across the EU, meant that the popular reaction was much more positive. So far Germany has accepted just over 1m refugees, the largest number in the EU after Poland (1.6m). The EU has agreed on a temporary mechanism for Ukrainian refugees that gives them the right to live and work in the bloc for up to three years without complex asylum procedures, aiding their integration into the labour force.
The working-age population is declining more swiftly than the European average Nonetheless, the demographic outlook will remain poor. As in the region more broadly, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline. EIU expects the share of the population aged 15-64 to fall throughout the forecast period, from 63.4% in 2022 to 60.9% in 2027. The share of the working-age population in Germany dipped below that of Italy in 2018 and the UK in 2020, and is falling more swiftly than in any of the country's regional peers. This is likely to lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, and over time will exacerbate labour shortages. Efforts have already been made to attract more women and older workers into employment, but there will be diminishing returns from these over the forecast period. Policy innovation will also be needed to attract immigrants into the labour market.
Germany has the second-highest number of immigrants in the world, after the US, with more than 16m first- and second-generation immigrants. The largest groups in 2021 (latest available data) were from Turkey (double the size of any other group), Poland, Syria, Romania and Italy. Aside from a large inflow of migrants from the Middle East and the Balkans in 2015-16, the turnaround in net immigration since 2011 reflects a rise in the number of people migrating to Germany from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, and to a lesser extent from crisis-hit members of the euro zone such as Italy and Greece. Germany has largely been successful at integrating the migrant labour force, and this has been the case with Ukrainian refugees as well. However, a majority of these refugees plan to return to Ukraine once this is possible, meaning that the positive impact on the size of the German labour force is likely to be temporary.

Germany will remain the fourth-largest economy in the world in 2027 Measured by GDP at current exchange rates, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind the US, China and Japan. According to EIU's forecasts, this will still be the case in 2027, with German GDP at about US$5.6trn. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, the German economy is the fifth-largest in the world, behind China, the US, India and Japan. Germany is the largest economy in Europe, almost 1.5 times the size of the French economy, the second largest; and accounts for just over 20% of total EU GDP. It is the largest consumer market in the EU in terms of population size, and GDP per head is the highest of the big economies. However, the market for consumer goods is reduced by an elevated savings rate, a cultural reluctance to buy on credit and the second-highest tax wedge as a share of labour costs in the OECD.

The short-term outlook for consumer demand is weak given high inflation The outlook for Germany's consumer market has weakened significantly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We expect consumer spending to continue to face considerable headwinds in 2023, given still-elevated price levels, increased energy and food bills, higher borrowing costs, and weakened wealth effects. Support will come from a resilient labour market, but consumer sentiment and buying intentions will take time to recover, with confidence still very weak in historical terms. Retail sales volumes-which account for about a third of consumer spending in Germany-declined for a fourth successive quarter in January-March 2023, and we expect a full-year contraction of more than 2%.
The inflationary backdrop has boosted some retailers' margins, with most major grocers benefiting. There is also an ongoing post-pandemic reallocation of spending from goods back towards services, with "revenge tourism"-to make up for the years of pandemic-related travel restrictions-still a notable trend in the EU. However, many small businesses face a heightened risk of squeezed margins and possible closure. There will be a gradual improvement in sentiment and retail activity in 2024-25 as price pressures diminish and real personal disposable incomes return to growth after contracting for three years. However, economic support will remain modest. Our medium-term forecast is for retail sales volumes to expand at an annual average of 0.5% in 2023-27.
Convenience, sustainability and luxury are growing areas of consumer demand Germany has a mature consumer market, relatively high average incomes and a steadily ageing population. The main characteristics of the grocery sector are its high concentration among four major retailers and comparatively low food prices (in regional terms), owing to a large and competitive discount sector. A major focus of grocery (and other) retailers in recent years has been revising store formats and services in response to growing digitisation and consumer demand for convenience-trends that were reinforced by the pandemic. This process will continue through the expansion of cashier-free and 24-hour stores, "scan and go" purchases, click-and-collect services, and online grocery delivery (or quick commerce). In addition to convenience, consumer demand will continue to grow for products that are sustainable; for ethnic, organic and local products; and for the expanding luxury segment.
Online marketplaces will evolve in 2023-27, amid new e-commerce taxation and increased regulatory scrutiny. After firm growth in 2020-21, total online sales fell in 2022 amid lower disposable incomes and as post-pandemic spending patterns stabilised. We expect another drop in 2023, but thereafter the online share of retail sales is forecast to rise gradually, to 14.5% of total sales in Germany by 2027.
Population ageing will influence longer-term spending patterns Demographic and social trends will influence spending patterns in the coming years. The rise in the number of single and two-person households, which now comprise three-quarters of the total, will support sales of white goods. There is also a rising demand for services for older consumers, particularly in the health and tourism sectors.

Initial conditions: Germany is a highly developed social market economy that is unusually export-oriented for its size (exports account for more than 50% of GDP, versus about 33% in France and the UK, and 12% in the US). More than half of production from sectors such as carmaking, mechanical and plant engineering, chemicals, and medical technology is exported. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), known as the Mittelstand, account for 99% of the total number of companies. A world-famous vocational education system and strong spending on research and development (R&D) underpin the industrial sector. Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, good infrastructure and stable institutions. Moreover, the structural shift away from manufacturing and towards services has been less pronounced in Germany than in other OECD members, with a strong outlook for services linked to the industrial sector.
The demographic outlook will prove the biggest drag on long-term growth Demographic trends: Germany's demographics will weigh on growth in the long-term period, with the total population set to shrink by an annual average of 0.2% in 2023-50, and the working-age population set to decline at an even more rapid rate of 0.6% per year. The retirement age is gradually being raised to 67 by 2031, but the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) has ruled out any further increase. Efforts to increase the participation rate are more likely to focus on tightening the conditions for long-term unemployment benefits and bringing more women, immigrants, lower-skilled and older workers into the active labour force. The negative rate of natural change in the population will continue to be slightly offset by positive immigration, with further liberalisation of immigration rules for highly skilled workers from non-EU countries possible. Policy will remain more welcoming to refugees and immigrants from central and eastern Europe than those from the Middle East or Africa, given cultural similarities.
External conditions: As an export-oriented country, Germany benefits from the broadly liberal world trade order, and will continue to push to reform the World Trade Organisation in order to maintain this. Germany has so far suffered less than other developed countries (such as Italy) from competition from emerging markets, such as China and India, owing to its specialisation in high-technology capital goods. However, Chinese companies are increasingly able to compete with German firms in sophisticated industrial manufacturing, which is driving a growing focus in Germany on digitalisation and innovation (Industry 4.0), and, belatedly, on the move to electric mobility. Germany will gradually reduce its economic reliance on China, in line with the EU's derisking policy, but this will be a much less decisive shift than in the US. Trade ties with Russia will also fall sharply over the long term as companies exit the Russian market and Germany reorients its energy supply network. Within the EU the liberalisation of services trade will continue, but slowly.
Rising investment and structural reforms will support productivity Institutions and policy trends: Low growth in the early 2000s focused the minds of politicians and policymakers on the need for economic reforms, many of which were implemented, along with more flexible bargaining about wages and other working conditions. These changes have put Germany at an advantage in the region more recently. EIU expects that national and EU initiatives will continue to strengthen productivity, with continued domestic efforts to reduce regulatory barriers and to make financing easier for innovative new firms. Greater investment in infrastructure and digitalisation in the coming years will help to make up for recent shortfalls in spending driven by an overwhelming focus on fiscal probity, and will support economic growth. Public debt increased sharply during the pandemic but remains manageable; reforms to the pension system to make the public finances sustainable in the long term are, however, not yet in sight.
Long-term performance: Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate (2023-50) is 1.2%. A falling working-age population is the main driver of this slowdown; total factor productivity and capital spending will still support growth. The picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with growth of real GDP per head averaging 1.4% in 2023-50. GDP per head in 2050 will therefore come to US$147,871, ahead of the UK and France but behind the US. In terms of the size of the German economy overall, we expect it to remain the fourth-largest economy in the world at market exchange rates in 2050, preceded by China, the US and India, in that order (in contrast to the current order of the US, China and Japan).

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The Energiewende, or energy transition, which focuses on expanding renewable energy and reducing Germany's carbon footprint, has been a critical element of the country's energy policy for the past decade. With The Greens now in government, an agreement has been reached to accelerate the energy transition, raising the target for the share of renewables in power generation from 60% to 80% by 2030, compared with a current share of about 45% (including nuclear). The coalition also intends to bring forward the coal phase-out by eight years, to 2030, although EIU does not expect it to be successful in this. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced a revision of Germany's energy policies, given the country's historically heavy reliance on gas imports from Russia. To offset the loss of Russian gas imports in 2022, Germany has extended the life of existing coal plants scheduled to be decommissioned in the short term; is turning more towards liquefied natural gas (LNG); and is speeding up its adoption of renewables, especially solar and wind.
Germany plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, reaching climate neutrality by 2045. On the supply side, Germany aims to become a global leader in green hydrogen (hydrogen produced solely with renewable energies), with an ambitious national hydrogen strategy announced in 2020.
Public support for emissions reduction is substantial. Nonetheless, frictions are likely to emerge. Closing coal-fired power stations will have a disproportionate impact on parts of eastern Germany where jobs are scarce and support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which denies human responsibility for climate change, is well established. The need to ensure adequate gas supplies while also reducing dependence on Russia-in line with policy efforts across the EU-will also be difficult to achieve, given limited alternative sources and inadequate LNG infrastructure.
Germany's exposure to the impact of climate change will remain comparatively low, given its geographical position, with limited coastal areas and a temperate climate. However, in recent years changes in rainfall patterns have led to low water levels in the Rhine (an important river for goods transportation), and in 2021 flash floods destroyed houses and infrastructure in the western part of the country, taking dozens of lives. Drought risks are elevated in 2023 and are likely to result in another year of disruptions to inland waterway traffic. We expect the government to remain willing to provide the infrastructure upgrades necessary in the face of more extreme weather patterns in the future, although in the short term construction firms will struggle with capacity constraints. Supply-chain risk may increase as countries on which the export-oriented German economy depends are damaged by climate change.
Technological developments Technological advancements will have a significant effect on Germany over the long term for a number of reasons. First, the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher there than in most other developed European countries, with industry accounting for almost 30% of the economy. According to the OECD, manufacturing is the sector most exposed to automation globally (along with agriculture), and jobs in Germany (as well as in central and eastern Europe, and Japan) are easier to automate than those in the UK, the US, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Second, Germany is typically strong at research and development (R&D) and innovation, which could make a transition to higher automation rates both more likely and quicker. In 2020 Germany spent 3.1% of GDP on R&D, among the highest rates in the EU (the average was 2.3%), but slightly behind Belgium, Sweden and Austria. Germany also filed 31% of all patents at the European Patent Office in 2021, the second-highest share in the world, after the US with 56%.
Third, Germany is already starting from a strong position. In 2020 it was ranked by the International Federation of Robotics as the fourth most highly automated country in the world, after Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Robot density stood at 371 robots per 10,000 workers, and Germany accounted for 38% of all industrial robots in Europe.
Germany is already working to increase automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies as part of its Industry 4.0 strategy, and efforts to embed new technologies across the industrial sector will continue over the long term. This is likely to be disruptive for the automotive sector in particular as e-mobility gains pace. It is also likely to prove difficult for the Mittelstand, the often family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises found across the country that are central to Germany's manufacturing prowess, as they may struggle to acquire the digital skills needed to compete with new challengers. Efforts to make these firms more resilient to digital disruption will gain pace in 2023-50. Although the country will not supplant the US as a leader in innovation, adoption of new technology will be consistently strong.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. EIU's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The newly elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), has formed a coalition of left-wing to centre-right parties, but its unity is tenuous and he faces a highly polarised environment that will pose challenges to governability. Political polarisation reached a peak on January 8th 2023, when far-right extremist supporters of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), mounted a violent insurrection in the capital, Brasília, during which they vandalised government buildings. Although protests have eased since then, left-right tensions will remain high. Centrist parties remain in control of Congress and reluctantly support Lula, which will keep the president's more controversial left-wing tendencies in check. This reinforces EIU's belief that Lula will pursue a moderate political and economic agenda during his third term as president (he served two terms in 2003-10).

- Brazil's overall business environment score improves in the 2023-27 forecast period, but greater advances elsewhere mean that the country falls into the lower half of our global table. Various factors are at play here as Brazil transitions from pandemic-era disruptions to a more state-led development model under Lula. Scores in four categories improve (macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, the labour market and technological readiness), whereas the rest remain unchanged. We assume that the Real will be less volatile in 2023-27 than in the 2018-22 historical period. However, even though a new budget framework will reduce fiscal risks, the policy mix will remain uneven, and a heavy public debt burden will require high interest rates to preserve price stability.

- Growth will remain tepid, constrained by a lack of structural reforms, poor infrastructure and low labour productivity. Lula will pursue broadly pragmatic but more state-led economic policies in 2023-26. High interest rates and a global economic slowdown will dampen GDP growth in 2023. Despite monetary easing, we expect GDP growth to remain below 2% in 2024-27, reflecting limited progress on introducing growth-enhancing reforms and increasing labour productivity. The Real has appreciated and stabilised in the first half of 2023, but volatility risks remain, as tax reform will come to a vote later this year. The currency will regain some of its losses from 2020-22 later in the forecast period, although the 2026 general election will trigger some volatility. Low public external debt and huge foreign reserves will keep external vulnerabilities in check.

- Brazil's population is the seventh largest in the world, but it is ageing, and this will act as a drag on growth. The population growth rate will fall to 0.5% per year in 2023-27 (still above the world average and well above western European rates). The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries, but working-age population growth is slowing to below the general population growth rate. This will put more stress on the pension system, despite a pension reform in 2019.

- Although Brazil dropped out of the list of the world's ten largest economies in 2020, partly owing to a weaker currency, it still offers attractive investment opportunities, especially in agriculture and energy. After a stimulus-led recovery from the 2020 recession, growth prospects are modest amid increasingly limited fiscal space. Moreover, it will be difficult to replicate the gains achieved in the decade before the 2014-16 recession in terms of reducing income inequality (reflected in job creation in low-skilled sectors, minimum-wage increases and a consumer credit boom). However, local capital markets are deepening, which will boost credit availability for businesses.

- We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.7% in the long-term forecast period (2023-50). Low labour productivity amid slowing labour force growth will weigh on long-term performance, despite progress in infrastructure and education, trade expansion, a stronger presence of multinational firms, and the development of Brazil's huge oil reserves. Growth could come in above our forecast if improvements in policymaking and the business environment exceed expectations. Performance will fluctuate with commodity cycles for many years to come, as agriculture and natural resource extraction remain major components of the economy. Climate change will crimp agricultural growth despite technological advances to make crops more resistant to warmer temperatures.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and liberalised the economy. Brazil reaped the benefits of these reforms under the left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), and enjoyed a commodity-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended under Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), a weak economy, corruption and poor public services contributed to public discontent that resulted in street protests and ultimately led to her impeachment. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), took over for the rest of her term. The next administration, led by a far-right populist, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), was notable for stoking polarisation, attacking the judiciary and mismanaging the covid-19 pandemic. Amid heightened political polarisation, Lula returned to the presidency in 2023 for a third term.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by the Supreme Federal Court (STF). The president can push legislation through using temporary decrees, but the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. More than 20 political parties are represented in Congress, and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to rigidity in central government primary spending. Congress passed a robust pension reform in October 2019 and will approve a new fiscal framework in 2023 to replace a discredited federal spending cap. The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) began a normalising monetary cycle in March 2021, taking the Selic rate to 13.75% as at August 2022 (where it remains). After strong election-related expenditure growth in 2022, fiscal consolidation will be slow, given Lula's plans to increase social spending. The public debt/GDP ratio stood at 72.9% at end-2022 and the fiscal deficit at an estimated 4% of GDP.
Taxation: Brazil's poorly structured revenue system is characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy.
Foreign trade: According to the World Bank, the trade-weighted average tariff rate was 8.4% in 2020, the third highest in South America, after Venezuela and Suriname. Goods export earnings totalled US$340bn in 2022, and imports reached US$296bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) returned to the presidency in January 2023 for a four-year term, having served in 2003-10. Political polarisation during the 2022 presidential campaign stoked tensions, culminating in a violent insurrection in the capital, Brasília, by violent supporters of the former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), on January 8th 2023 (one week into Lula's presidency). Political tensions have eased since then, but they remain high by historical standards, adding to the governability challenge posed by a fragmented Congress in which more than 20 parties are represented. On its own, the PT holds only 11% of seats in the Senate (the upper house) and 15% of seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Lula has managed to build a coalition that gives him 52% of the lower house and 56% of the upper house (based on the parties that are represented in his cabinet). However, ideological differences (the coalition spans far-left and centre-right parties) mean that these alliances are fragile.
Next elections: Presidential, congressional and state elections will next be held in October 2026. The next municipal elections will be held in October 2024.

Political outlook: Political stability Lula has been more left-wing than expected since taking office. However, he faces the challenge of advancing his socially progressive and state-led growth agenda through a right-leaning, socially conservative Congress. Legislators will block his efforts to reverse some of the liberalising reforms and privatisations (including the privatisation of Eletrobras, a power company, last year) that have been passed since the PT left power in 2016, not least because many of them were involved in granting those approvals. Lula will therefore try to unpick the reforms and privatisations via legal routes up to the Supreme Federal Court (STF). The STF's rulings can be unpredictable, but EIU assumes that there will be few major changes to past reforms and privatisations.
Despite distributing political favours and budget allocations to legislators beyond his electoral coalition of parties, Lula is struggling to build a solid majority. Arthur Lira and Rodrigo Pacheco were re-elected to the leadership of the lower and upper houses respectively (positions that they held under Mr Bolsonaro). They are pragmatic centre-right politicians and have agreed to co-operate with parts of the government agenda that they support (such as a new fiscal framework and tax simplification reforms), but Lula will not have it all his own way. Of the two congressional leaders, Mr Lira is the more powerful, as the lower house tends to shape the legislative agenda, and although he will occasionally take Lula's side, he is also likely to prove a thorn in Lula's side at times.
Moreover, a congressional inquiry into the January 8th insurrection by radical Bolsonaro supporters is under way and is bound to sustain left-right tensions in Brazil's deeply polarised politics and society, although we do not expect this to derail this year's fiscal and tax reforms. An imminent vote on Lula's new fiscal framework will give a sense of how large a majority he can command for other reforms. The legislation only needs a simple majority, but the government is seeking more than 60% of the votes, as that higher share will be required to pass tax simplification reforms later this year; success on the fiscal framework bill (which we expect) would establish a good precedent. It is worth noting, however, that there is more consensus on these reforms than on many of Lula's other socially progressive policies.
The shift to a more state-led model under Lula means that economic performance is likely to be weak. This poses an underlying risk to political stability, as it will dent Lula's popularity (opinion polls show that his approval rating is already below 40%), sapping his political capital and hence his ability to hold together his congressional alliance. However, if the government enacts its desired reforms to the benefit of investor confidence, Lula will receive a political boost going into next year, when other (lesser) reforms will still be possible before the October 2024 municipal elections. Governability will remain subject to erosion later on as parties in Lula's alliance jockey for position ahead of the next general election, in 2026.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Since Lula was last in charge, Brazil's political environment has become sharply polarised between the right and the left, compounding many long-standing factors that weaken governability and fuel political instability. Structural features that hamper political and institutional effectiveness include a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, extremely slow legal processes, widespread corruption, crime and informality, and a weak party system. The centrão (a large group of centrist parties) holds the balance of power in Congress and plays a moderating role in public policy. However, the rise of populism in recent years threatens the effective functioning of political institutions and could undermine the rule of law, raising risks to Brazil's democratic institutions.
A fragile governing coalition will keep Lula from veering too far to the left Extreme polarisation will exacerbate the governability challenges that have plagued previous administrations. The mobilised right-wing opposition, coupled with a highly fragmented Congress, will pose significant risks to governability. Lula's pragmatism has allowed him to form a broad-based coalition (spanning far-left to centre-right parties) to the benefit of governability, but ideological differences mean that alliances between these groups are tenuous. The parties that are represented in Lula's cabinet (which comprises 37 ministers, compared with 23 under Mr Bolsonaro) account for just over half of the legislators in each house of Congress. However, given that discipline in some of those parties is not strictly enforced, Lula's majority could evaporate if his government veers too far to the left or if his horse-trading efforts are insufficient to keep all of his allies satisfied.
A broad-based and tenuous coalition, a mobilised right-wing opposition, high levels of polarisation and a tight budget will keep Lula's left-wing tendencies in check, supporting our view that he will pursue a centrist agenda. He will be constrained, too, by the need to obtain support from the centrão to pass his agenda, including tax reform, which we believe will go to a vote later this year. We think that the centrão would oppose any radical left-wing moves, meaning that controversial reforms are likely to be watered down and that horse-trading will play an increasing role in policymaking.
Although we expect Lula's relationship with Congress to remain difficult, tensions between the executive and the judiciary have eased. Mr Bolsonaro insulted and attacked members of the high courts, criticising some of their decisions. Lula has repaired the relationship by respecting the autonomy of the judiciary. He will have the opportunity to replace two members of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) as they reach 75 years of age (the mandatory retirement age) during his term.
Mid-term local elections will complicate progress on reforms A particular weakness of Brazil's political system is that ambitious reforms are more likely in the first 12 months of an administration's four-year term. This partly reflects the fact that new governments generally have a stronger mandate but is also a product of the electoral calendar; local elections fall due at the end of the president's second year in office, meaning that political parties are reluctant to approve unpopular measures in that year. The third year of a presidential term offers another window of opportunity for reforms before attention turns to the next general election in the final year. Further weaknesses of the system are the large number of stakeholders at various levels of government (federal, state and local) and socioeconomic differences between Brazil's regions, which influence the motivations of their representatives. These factors have all played a role in obstructing tax simplification reforms, which have been on and off the agenda for nearly 20 years.
Moreover, politicians of all stripes are open to lobbying from private interest groups, as well as public-sector unions. The highest-paid civil servants are particularly well organised, which has enabled them to secure ever-greater budgetary resources via higher salaries and benefits. Administrative reforms that could help to modernise the civil service (for example by phasing out redundant roles) and to make it more efficient are unlikely under Lula, owing to his proximity to labour unions.
Political outlook: Election watch Brazilians will next vote in October 2024, in municipal elections, giving Lula's administration a single year to pass bold proposals such as the new fiscal framework and tax reform. These local polls will serve as a barometer for sentiment towards Lula's left-wing government and for levels of support for the right-wing parties that performed well in the October 2022 general election.
The circumstances of the 2026 presidential election will depend on economic performance. If this proves disappointing, for example because the government fails to set the public finances on a more sustainable path, Lula's chances of either standing for re-election or hand-picking a successor will suffer. In such a scenario, we believe that a right-wing figure would have a good chance of winning. Although the extremist violence in January has undermined Mr Bolsonaro's political standing to some degree (and he may yet be barred from running again), he is still prominent. Other figures could also do well, given the strength of the right wing in Brazil's deeply fragmented political culture; Mr Bolsonaro's allies significantly strengthened their presence in both houses of Congress in 2022, and Mr Bolsonaro himself was beaten by a tiny margin.
Political outlook: International relations Whereas the Ministry of Finance is in the hands of moderate PT figures, foreign policy will be driven by the party's left-wingers. Throughout his term Lula will try to take Brazil further along its traditional "non-aligned" path by seeking closer ties with the other BRIC nations (Russia, India and China) to forge a multi-polar world in which Brazil is a global player. The stakes are high: controversial comments made by Lula concerning the Russia-Ukraine war during a visit to China in April have elicited pushback from Western leaders, illustrating the risk of missteps while navigating deepening geopolitical divisions between East and West. For now, although we do not expect the West to impose any direct sanctions on Brazil, the US will become less keen to provide the country with the same levels of development funding and co-operation on security issues that some other Latin American countries receive. Moreover, Lula's foreign agenda could now obstruct the ratification of a long-delayed free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). However, that development does not affect our forecasts, as we had not yet pencilled in a deal. More broadly, Western countries will regard Brazil as a less reliable partner for co-operation on geopolitically sensitive issues.
Lula's recent visit to China resulted in large inward investments and will reset bilateral relations, which soured under Mr Bolsonaro. Closer to home, we expect a rapprochement between Brazil and other South American countries, many of which have also elected left-wing governments recently or have authoritarian leaders (particularly Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua).

Brazil's overall business environment score improves in EIU's 2023-27 forecast period, but the country drops into the lower half of the countries covered amid faster improvements elsewhere. Various factors are behind the change in score as Brazil shifts from an era of pandemic-related disruptions to one of state-led development under the newly elected president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT). There are improvements in four categories (macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, the labour market and technological readiness), but the other scores remain unchanged. We assume that the Real will be less volatile than during the 2018-22 historical period. However, Brazil will still have an unbalanced policy mix and a heavy public debt burden that will require high interest rates to maintain price stability, even though a new budget framework will ease fiscal risks. The labour market-traditionally one of the weakest areas of the business environment-will improve slightly, reflecting a post-pandemic recovery and new legislation to reduce labour costs. The availability of skilled labour (a long-standing weakness) will gradually increase, and levels of language skills will rise.
Brazil's best business environment scores are for foreign trade and policy towards foreign investment, despite Lula's state-led approach to economic policy. Brazil will continue to attract foreign investment owing to its large market, a diversified economy and its role in global climate and energy transition dynamics. Brazil's deep domestic capital markets mean that it scores well for financing. Meanwhile, political effectiveness, taxes and infrastructure are Brazil's weakest categories. In fact, the country has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world, and although we expect reforms to pass this year, the full benefits of simplification reforms will be felt more fully in the longer term. Meanwhile, Brazil will struggle to reverse its historical gap in infrastructure provision, partly owing to fiscal constraints.

Brazil's macroeconomic environment score improves in the forecast period, as we think that the Real will be less volatile than in 2018-22, when-like many emerging-market currencies-it was rocked by global shocks and swings in the US dollar's value amid the covid-19 pandemic. However, the overall score is constrained by an unbalanced policy mix-Brazil's heavy debt burden requires high interest rates to maintain price stability-and the situation is unlikely to improve. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal policies will be expansionary under Lula, particularly involving greater financing at subsidised rates through the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). We expect Congress to approve Lula's new fiscal framework by mid-year. His new rules are more flexible than the existing ones that cap federal spending to zero growth in real terms, but they will still limit spending growth to up to 70% of revenue growth. The government envisages a swing to a primary surplus of 1% of GDP by 2026, but we think that its underlying revenue projections are overly optimistic. We therefore expect that the government will miss its fiscal targets and that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise from 73% currently, exceeding 80% in 2026-27.
A new fiscal anchor is a positive, but inflation targets are under pressure Lula has recently attacked Roberto Campos Neto, governor of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank), for keeping the Selic policy rate high (it stands at 13.75% currently). Nevertheless, we do not expect Lula to undermine the BCB's independence or interfere with the existing floating exchange-rate regime. There is a risk, however, that the monetary council (comprising two government ministers and Mr Campos Neto) will raise Brazil's medium-term inflation targets, as Lula considers the 3% target for 2024-25 too low (it was 4.5% under his party's administrations in 2003-16). We expect the BCB to embark on a monetary-easing cycle in August, reducing the real rate to 4-5% over the next two years, with inflation fluctuating at around 4% from 2024-higher than in most Latin American countries. When Mr Campos Neto's term finishes at end-2024, there is a risk that Lula will nominate a more heterodox figure who could undermine investor confidence in the BCB's commitment to the inflation-targeting strategy.

- Lula's state-led growth model will keep GDP growth below 2% throughout the forecast period. However, Brazil's large market, which we expect to reach US$2.6trn by 2027, will still attract investors. The country's huge agricultural harvest will support the economy and the external sector. Although we expect the current-account deficit to widen in the medium term as imports pick up, it will be covered by sizeable foreign direct investment (FDI), especially if the government manages to advance its green transition agenda and joins the OECD.

Although Brazil performs relatively well in this area, policy towards private enterprise and competition will be less business-friendly and prospects for privatisation much weaker under Lula than under Mr Bolsonaro. For example, Lula is more likely than his predecessor to shift governance norms at regulatory agencies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) towards increased political interference in some sectors, partly to favour political allies. He will also halt plans to privatise key sectors such as oil and the postal services. Even so, there will be opportunities for investors via public-private partnerships (PPPs), as well as in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space, which Lula will promote as he trumpets his environmental credentials on the global stage.

- Lula's efforts to change regulations that govern the Agência Nacional de Águas e Saneamento Básico (ANA, the water and sanitation agency) could obstruct efforts to boost private participation in the expansion of sanitation services. Congress has pushed back on the legislation, but Lula will not be deterred. He has also tried to change Law 13,303/2016 to reduce the "quarantine" time required for politicians to take up high-ranking position at SOEs from three years to only 30 days. Following pushback from investors, the president of the upper house, Rodrigo Pacheco, suspended debates on the bill, but legislators will eventually return to it, so we will continue to monitor developments.
- Lula has halted plans to privatise big players in oil and gas, postal services and the media. He also wants to regain state control over Eletrobras, an electric power company; the state's participation in the firm was diluted to 40% in June 2022, and no single shareholder is allowed more than 10% of voting rights. Lula has sought an injunction against the privatisation, but the Supreme Federal Court (STF) is likely to block it. The current Congress is fairly market-oriented and will not want to make any changes, particularly given that many of the current legislators only recently voted to approve the privatisation.

Brazil's score in 2023-27 for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged, and the country remains one of the best performers in the region. Brazil received the third-largest haul of foreign direct investment (FDI) last year, behind the US and China, driven by reinvested earnings. Some European markets were hit by the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, meaning that Brazil is likely to slip down the global rankings over the medium term, but the country should still remain a top ten destination for FDI throughout 2023-27. Despite Lula's state-led economic model, Brazil still welcomes foreign investors, and opportunities will be plentiful, owing to its large market size, its diversified economy and its role in global climate and energy transition dynamics. Brazil also stands to benefit from nearshoring dynamics with the US (albeit less so than Mexico, which is geographically closer to the US) and from its reputation for being a safe location away from regions of the world where geopolitical tensions are high. Investment opportunities in infrastructure, agri-business, renewable energy and other sectors, combined with reasonable prospects for the approval of key reforms such as tax simplification, will make the country an attractive investment choice. Nevertheless, some geopolitical and fiscal risks will linger. Geopolitical risks relate to Lula's championing of a "non-aligned" foreign policy, which could cause a souring of Brazil's ties with the West. Meanwhile, despite Lula's new budget framework, public debt/GDP ratio will continue to rise, surpassing 80% within the forecast period, posing fiscal risks.
Brazil will remain in the top ten for FDI because of its policies and market size
- Over the last decade Brazilian governments have gradually improved conditions for international investment, opening up opportunities for foreign capital in important sectors such as infrastructure, transport and logistics, and energy, while simultaneously reducing taxes and streamlining bureaucracy. The law guarantees foreign investors the same treatment as domestic ones, although there are restrictions on some activities (such as nuclear energy, postal and telegraph services, the launch and deployment of satellites, the acquisition or rental of rural property, media and mining).
- Lula's efforts to make Brazil a bigger global player will be based on the country's long diplomatic tradition of neutrality on geopolitical issues, but he will be more active on this front than during his previous presidential terms (2003-10). This represents a shift away from Mr Bolsonaro's pursuit of personal alliances with a handful of right-leaning western leaders, such as the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21). This approach, together with Mr Bolsonaro's lax stewardship of the Amazon rainforest, left Brazil isolated globally. Lula will pursue more sustainable environmental policies, broadening Brazil's appeal to more countries and helping him to advance an ESG agenda. However, walking the geopolitical tightrope in a polarised world carries risks, especially given tensions relating to the Russia-Ukraine war and deepening US-China rivalry. In particular, Lula's failure to condemn Russia and (separately) to let Iranian ships dock in Rio de Janeiro has sent mixed signals to the West regarding his positions on sensitive issues. This could weigh on trade and foreign investment ties with some countries, although the imposition of (explicit or implicit) sanctions appears unlikely. On the China issue, Lula's visit to the country in April resulted in promises of investment from Chinese companies in areas of strategic importance for the Brazilian government, not only in energy transition but also for Lula's re-industrialisation drive.

Brazil's score in this category remains unchanged in 2023-27, reflecting its solid trade prospects despite mixed signals about trade openness. Lula's finance minister, Fernando Haddad, is likely to reverse some of his predecessor's tax changes, including a reduction in the tax on industrial goods imports. Lula's preference for promoting trade and investment relations within the Global South, including by prioritising an inward-looking, protectionist Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union that also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), may wipe out opportunities for more beneficial agreements with advanced economies. Brazil's accession to the OECD may suffer some delays; the Bolsonaro government began the entry process, but Lula is lukewarm about it from an ideological standpoint and will assess the requirements, meaning that it will be a slow process. Meanwhile, despite Lula's overtures regarding the EU-Mercosur free-trade agreement (FTA)-pending a review of the terms agreed by negotiators in 2019-ratification looks unlikely in 2023-27 because of political resistance in some EU countries. However, if Lula sets Brazil's export-oriented commodity sector on an ESG-friendly course, there could be a significant boost for trade.
The Lula administration will step up its efforts to strengthen Mercosul if two recent developments are anything to go by. The first is that Brazil and Argentina (the bloc's two largest players) have declared support for the creation of a common South American currency designed to facilitate the financial clearing of trade within the bloc. This is aimed at reducing vulnerability to global shocks and providing an alternative to traditional hard currencies, like the US dollar (Argentina has been suffering a dollar drought, crimping its ability to import goods from Brazil). However, even though this would not be a euro-style unification, foreign-exchange risks led to pushback from investors, making it unlikely that the initiative will advance much over the medium term. Secondly, Uruguay has been questioning the benefits of Mercosur membership more recently and has expressed a wish to sign FTAs independently of the bloc, for example with China, prompting Brazil and Argentina to review the bloc's strategies and objectives. The prospect of a China-Mercosul trade deal could encourage EU parliaments to approve the EU-Mercosur FTA and could make Lula more flexible on the terms in exchange for faster ratification. A ratified EU-Mercosul treaty could also help Brazil's OECD accession and could play well with the US, given its fears about China's growing influence in Latin America.

Because of its complexity and burden on companies, tax is one of Brazil's weakest categories, and although we expect tax reforms to pass this year, a long transition period will mean that the full benefits of simplification will only be felt beyond the 2023-27 forecast period. Meanwhile, Lula's proposals to change the income tax code will sustain uncertainty regarding tax. Brazil currently has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world: according to World Bank data, companies in Brazil spend about 1,700 hours annually on paying their taxes-much longer than the average of 240 hours for 88 middle-income countries. At 33.7% of GDP in 2022 (according to the Treasury), Brazil's tax burden is on a par with the OECD average, but it is high by developing-country standards, and its public services and infrastructure are poor. Tax revenue comes largely from indirect taxation levied on goods and services (about 45% of the total burden; the OECD average is 32%), which pushes up production costs and weighs on Brazil's competitiveness. A huge array of sectoral benefits and tax exemptions contributes to inefficiency and hampers competition.
Tax simplification reforms are on the cards
- A tax reform agenda that Mr Bolsonaro initiated in 2021 was delayed by the 2022 general election, but the new government has taken up the issue, reflecting broad and long-standing political consensus over the need to simplify consumption taxes and make the income tax code more progressive. The tax reforms will comprise two phases. The first will focus on simplification by creating a unified value-added tax (VAT) to replace federal, state and local consumption taxes. The second will be aimed at redesigning income taxes to make them more progessive, pro-investment and levied more on individuals than on corporations. The second part may well face more resistance from legislators, especially if income tax reforms increase the burden on the middle classes or lift the overall tax burden. The VAT reform is not intended to increase the tax burden, although Lula's economic team believes that it will boost tax revenue by lifting economic growth; estimates suggest that it could increase potential GDP by 0.5% by the end of the transition period (set to last about eight years). Mr Haddad also wants to close some tax loopholes for firms, but he will encounter stiff resistance from lobby groups. One way or another, the government is banking on raising revenue to meet its target of a primary surplus of 1% of GDP by 2026 as part of its new fiscal framework-an aim that we consider overly optimistic.

Brazil's relatively good score for financing remains unchanged in 2023-27, but this lack of progress means that it is overtaken by other countries, both in the global and regional rankings. To Brazil's benefit, we expect a monetary-easing cycle to begin in August 2023, easing the tighter financing conditions that have been in place since 2022. We expect the Lula government to resume the provision of subsidised loans and credit by launching new credit lines at below-market rates through state-run banks, especially BNDES. However, fiscal constraints and high levels of indebtedness in Brazil's economy will limit the extent to which public lending can drive growth. This means that private capital markets, which have grown strongly since 2016 and had a spurt in 2020-21 owing to historically low pandemic-era interest rates, will still play an important role in Brazil's overall financing structure. In our view, increased public lending via subsidised interest rates will inject some inefficiencies and distortions, even though it will provide alternatives, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
BCB will cut policy rates, but real rates are higher than in the past
- The BCB has taken the Selic policy rate from a record low of 2% in early 2021 to 13.75% in August 2022 to combat a surge in consumer prices that took inflation above 12%. Now that headline inflation is easing (it had fallen to 4.2% as at April, partly owing to tax cuts on fuels that were implemented in mid-2022), the government is putting pressure on the BCB to cut rates. For the time being the BCB is sticking to its hawkish stance, waiting for inflation expectations, which are still high-reflecting sticky core inflation of over 7% and lingering uncertainty over fiscal policy-to decline towards the inflation target in the relevant time horizon (12-18 months ahead). Once the upper house has joined the lower house in approving Lula's fiscal framework, uncertainty should ease, paving the way for an easing cycle that will take the Selic towards a neutral rate of 4-5% in real terms. This rate is higher than it was in 2017-22, reflecting Lula's expansionary fiscal and quasi-fiscal policies. The monetary council could raise the current inflation targets at its annual meeting in June, although we have not pencilled any changes into our forecasts yet. A higher inflation target would not necessarily open the door for lower nominal interest rates; this depends on the government's ability to restore investor confidence, which in turn depends on the progress of important reforms.
- State-run banks (especially BNDES)will once again become an important source of financing under Lula, offering new credit lines at below-market rates. Aloízio Mercadante, a PT stalwart, is the current BNDES president; he espouses a greater role for the state in the economy and intends to double the bank's lending portfolio from 1% of GDP currently to 2% by 2026-still below the unsustainable level of 4% of GDP under a former president, Dilma Rousseff (2003-11), also of the PT. Moreover, he aims to substitute the current long-term interest rate-based on long-term Treasury inflation-protected securities, which pay fixed real rates above inflation-with more flexible and less volatile rates, according to the type and duration of the investment. However, fiscal constraints, a recognition that lending from state banks under past PT governments was too high and too distortionary, and current high levels of indebtedness will all limit the use of public lending as a driver of growth.

The labour market has traditionally been one of the weakest areas of Brazil's business environment. The country's underlying score and rankings strengthen slightly in 2023-27 as participation and employment rates return to pre-pandemic levels and new legislation reduces the cost of labour. The availability of skilled labour (a long-standing weakness) will gradually improve, and levels of language skills among the workforce will rise. However, these improvements will come from a low base, and standards will remain weak by regional and global standards. Although wages are fairly low, the overall cost of labour for employers is high, as social security obligations and labour benefits add an extra third to salary costs. Moreover, unstable legislation is a risk to labour rules and contracts.
Past labour reforms will be maintained under Lula despite his misgivings
- After dipping below 8% in late 2022, unemployment has crept up, to 8.5% as at April (still substantially lower than the average unemployment rate of 12% in 2017-19). Although 1.9m jobs have been created in the past two years, the headline unemployment rate masks a drop in the workforce. However, prospects for growth in the industrial and infrastructure sectors will raise the supply of and demand for skilled labour and better-paid jobs, which will make the labour market more dynamic and vibrant over the forecast period.
- Lula and the PT have always criticised the 2017 labour reform, claiming that it caused workers' bargaining power to weaken disproportionately. Although his government has promised not to reverse the reform completely, parts of it will still come under review. For example, although the government will not try to reinstate mandatory transfers from formal workers' pay to labour unions, it may seek to strengthen contractual conditions for professionals in the gig economy to give them the same benefits that apply to formal sector workers (such as pension and health benefits, holiday leave and unemployment insurance). This would bolster worker protection in the more precarious parts of Brazil's labour market. Lula also recently announced a bill to guarantee that women are paid the same as men for the same type of job and occupation.
- The government may also seek to reduce the cost of labour in order to lessen the burden on some forms of formal labour. This could constitute part of the second phase of tax reform, which focuses on income tax and is due to reach Congress in 2023; the overall aim would be to reduce the burden levied on payroll and to increase taxation on income and profits. This would enhance the country's competitiveness and would particularly benefit labour-intensive sectors such as services, construction and retail.
- In the short term, the government will devise a rule that would resurrect one of the PT's trademark policies: to systematically ensure that minimum-wage rises outpace inflation. The rule that was in place under former PT governments involved adding the average real GDP growth rate of the past two years to the inflation rate. However, this caused wage rises to outstrip productivity gains and overall public spending to soar, given that the value of the minimum wage also serves as a reference for pensions and social benefits and therefore affects about half of the federal budget. We therefore think that the government will introduce an intermediate measure, which could involve using GDP per capita growth or introducing a real growth band in line with the new fiscal anchor to keep real growth in the minimum wage between 0.6% and 2.5% per year.

Brazil's difficulty in reversing long-standing deficiencies in infrastructure provision-partly due to fiscal constraints-keeps its score for this category very weak. Public and private infrastructure spending is low in Brazil, at about 1.9% of GDP in 2022, according to InterB (a local consultancy) and is only about half of the amount required to prevent infrastructure decay. Private concessions of infrastructure assets through the public-private partnership (PPP) programmes will probably gain momentum and will be a major driver of infrastructure upgrade efforts in 2023-27, given that the PT has generally favoured this strategy as a way of recovering investment capacity. Brazil's Investment Partnership Programme (PPI)-managed by Lula's influential chief of staff, Rui Costa, a moderate PT figure-has a portfolio of more than 200 projects and expected investments of US$180bn in various infrastructure sectors (including transport, mining and energy). Given that Lula considers infrastructure investment an important vehicle for generating jobs and raising employment, we expect him to make it a priority. His main challenge-as in many areas of the business environment-will be to resolve ideological differences between the PT and other leftist parties that support the government. We expect the moderate vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, to play a constructive, facilitating role.
Infrastructure will suffer from fiscal constraints and ideological differences
- In particular, Lula will need to manage conflicts arising from different regional interests and views on the role of the private sector as opposed to SOEs in future concessions. This challenge became clear at the outset of his term, when investors grew concerned about setbacks to a recently approved sanitation framework (Law 14,026/2020), which paved the way for private companies to expand their participation in sanitation concessions and imposed stricter rules and targets on existing (mostly state) companies, as part of efforts to guarantee universal access to basic sanitation services by 2033. In setting out his government's organisational structure, Lula sought to transfer the ANA to the environment ministry (headed by Marina Silva, a high-profile environmentalist who held the job during Lula's first term) and strip it of its role in regulating sanitation services. Negative reactions from sectoral experts and private players prompted Lula to reverse the changes, meaning that the ANA and the sanitation framework will remain as they were (at least for now).
- Another example of the way in which ideological differences may delay the privatisation agenda relates to the Port of Santos, Brazil's biggest port, which is located in São Paulo state. The minister of ports and airports, Márcio França (a centre-left politician and former São Paulo governor), opposes privatisation, whereas the current São Paulo governor, Tarcísio de Freitas (who served as infrastructure minister under Mr Bolsonaro), favours that move. Mr Alckmin, who is also minister for development, industry, commerce and services, supports private participation in public concessions and could play a role in brokering consensus over investment projects of this kind.

Brazil's score improves in this category, but the country slips in the global and regional rankings as others improve faster. As in many countries, information and communication technology (ICT) is regarded as a strategic area, and a national Internet of Things (IoT) plan was launched in mid-2019. Global shortages of IT equipment and budget cuts have slowed the rollout, but digitalisation of government services has still advanced (particularly at the federal level), and the number of devices connected to the IoT has increased markedly, especially with the implementation of 5G network. Lula wants to develop digital markets in a more competitive environment, but also under tighter regulation.

- In 2022 the Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel, the telecoms regulator) authorised 5G technology in Brasília (the capital). The original 5G auction (in November 2021) envisaged that all state capitals would be served by the new technology by end-July 2022, but global shortages of chips and electronic equipment have caused delays. Nevertheless, mobile and internet operators are expanding the 5G network relatively quickly, which will be crucial for IoT evolution, especially in education, medicine, agriculture and industrial automation. The government's plan is to provide 5G coverage to state capitals and cities of over 30,000 people by 2029. Currently 140 Brazilian cities have 5G access, representing 38.5% of the population. The number of active devices with an IoT connection reached 14.4bn in 2022, according IoT Analytics, a specialist consultancy. This figure is likely to double over the forecast period.
- Brazil is the region's largest market for internet users but lags Chile, Argentina and Mexico for penetration. About 81% of the population has access to the internet, although coverage is lower in rural areas (about 73%) and among the poorest Brazilians (61%), according to the government's internet steering committee. This has raised some regulatory risks for 5G auction winners, as they must meet universal coverage as determined and monitored by Anatel.

Lula wants to develop digital markets in a more competitive environment
- Lula will attempt to develop digital markets in Brazil in a more competitive environment, but also under tighter regulations. Legislation will be driven by the global debate on digital policies and will take inspiration from European law. The government will target three main areas: social media regulation (through Law 2,630/2020), which aims to curb the spread of fake news and hate speech on digital platforms; digital markets regulation (Law 2,768/2022), which seeks to create an antitrust framework for digital platforms operating in Brazil, make Anatel the oversight body and create a digital platform inspection tax; and new audiovisual regulations (Laws 8,889/2017 and 3,832/2019), which are intended to update paid TV legislation, address content quotas, enhance state control over streaming services and balance competition in the TV and streaming markets. Given that the social media legislation has the best chance of being approved out of these three areas, major online platforms are likely to be particularly affected by Lula's drive to tighten regulations in the digital space.

Online retail will come under greater oversight by the tax authorities
- Online retail surged amid covid-19, and nearly half of Brazilians now do some of their shopping online. The volume of postal remittances from abroad to Brazil (cross-border transactions) soared by nearly 40% in 2021-22, rising to about 176m, according to the tax office. Purchases from individuals to individuals up to US$50 are exempt from tax, but international e-commerce players have been using this benefit to subvert tax payments by transforming business-to-customer (B2C) sales into customer-to-customer (C2C) ones. Lula's efforts to close this loophole generated pushback from ordinary Brazilians who benefit from the current exemption, and the government has backed down. The tax authorities will increase their oversight, and red tape will become stricter, but we still expect double-digit growth in online sales (in local-currency terms) in the 2023-27 forecast period.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), has positioned himself firmly on the left of the political spectrum since taking office in January 2023, but despite this, and although he is pursuing state-led development, he is also pursuing policies to secure fiscal sustainability and satisfy markets. Among Lula's economic priorities are to establish new fiscal rules that provide more flexibility while preserving a rules-based framework that satisfies markets, and to push through tax reforms to simplify the tax system and make it more progressive. He is seeking, too, to encourage state-led development-for example by doubling lending by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and by halting (and even trying to reverse) privatisations-and to pursue better environmental policies that facilitate more foreign investment (or at the very least reduce the risk of disinvestment).
EIU expects economic policy to be fiscally more expansionary and state-driven under Lula than under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22). Although Lula recently unleashed strong verbal attacks on the governor of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) for keeping interest rates high, we do not expect him to try to change the bank's independent status. There is a risk, however, that Brazil's monetary council will lift the medium-term inflation targets, as Lula considers the 3% target for 2024-25 too low (it was 4.5% under PT administrations in 2003-16), although we have not pencilled in any changes to our forecasts for now. Along similar lines, the government will not pursue new privatisations and will instead interfere in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to make them pursue its public policy goals. Political appointments to SOEs (in order to favour allies) could also weaken their governance structures.
The risk of fiscal policy becoming unsustainably expansionary has diminished, as Lula's fiscal framework envisages that spending will grow more slowly than revenue. We expect Congress to approve the legislation in June without loosening the rules (in fact, legislators are more likely to tighten them). Another priority for Lula's government in 2023 will be to pass a reform aimed at simplifying Brazil's burdensome tax system (prospects for which are reasonable) and at making it more progressive (which will be trickier). Tax simplification would buoy business sentiment, although the full benefits would not be felt immediately, as many of the changes would be introduced gradually. Although new privatisations are not on the horizon, we expect progress on infrastructure concessions to continue. Lula is unlikely to try to overhaul a 2017 reform that made labour legislation more flexible, although his government will seek targeted changes, such as expanding benefits for autonomous, remote and informal workers.

Total public-sector debt 72.9 76.3 78.7 79.9 80.8 80.5
The government needs to revise the fiscal rules and enact tax reform this year to put the public finances on a sustainable path and satisfy markets while still making sure that it has enough resources to pursue some policy priorities. We think that Congress will approve the proposed new fiscal framework by mid-year. This would replace Brazil's rigid public-spending cap rules with a more flexible fiscal framework that would allow federal expenditure to rise in real terms by up to 70% of revenue growth.
The fiscal framework includes targets for reducing the primary balance to zero in 2024 and then generating surpluses of 0.5% and 1% of GDP in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The targets carry a tolerance range of 0.25% of GDP, which should improve budget management by avoiding disorderly year-end adjustments. However, we think that the government's revenue projections are overly optimistic. The finance minister, Fernando Haddad, has said that he will not increase taxes or introduce new ones, but will instead raise revenue (to the tune of 1.5% of GDP next year) by closing loopholes and enacting other measures. We are sceptical about his chances of success, and our fiscal forecasts assume that he will raise less than half of what he envisages.
We expect other tax reforms to pass this year. These are likely to involve simplifying the tax code by unifying several sales taxes into something resembling a single value-added tax (VAT), and making the tax regime more progressive by raising the personal income tax threshold. The government also wants to introduce a tax on dividends, and will possibly make other revenue-raising tweaks. The impact of these on the tax take is still unclear (not least because Congress is reluctant to back tax increases), but our assumption is that any revenue-raising measures will generate about half of the extra spending approved for 2023 (and for subsequent years). On that basis, we forecast that the government will miss its primary balance targets and that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise to 80% by 2027. Given Brazil's heavy debt burden, fiscal policy will remain the principal source of macroeconomic risk, although low public external indebtedness means that a debt crisis would evolve as an inflationary problem rather than an external debt default.

We expect the BCB to keep the Selic rate at 13.75% until it embarks on an easing cycle in August. There is a risk that the BCB will keep rates higher for longer, as investor concerns about possible changes to the medium-term inflation targets (which are currently set to fall from 3.25% in 2023 to 3% in 2024 and beyond) are keeping medium-term inflation expectations above target. Under pressure from Lula, the monetary council may well raise the targets to 3.5-4.5% at its annual target-setting meeting in June. If confidence weakens enough to trigger substantial currency depreciation, inflationary pressures will reassert themselves, probably prompting further monetary tightening. However, our baseline scenario is that policy normalisation will bring the real rate down to 4-5% over 2024-27, implying a Selic rate of 8-9%.

Brazil's real GDP growth will slow from 2.9% in 2022 to 1.7% in 2023 as an economic deceleration in the US and Europe, elevated domestic interest rates and still-high inflation outweigh stronger commodity demand from China. Brazil's economic data and labour dynamics so far this year have been more resilient than we had anticipated, although we still expect the economy to slow in an environment of tight credit conditions, until monetary easing begins later this year. These factors will limit household consumption and investment, and the deterioration in fiscal dynamics will constrain government spending.
Assuming that the global economy recovers from 2024, we expect Brazil's growth to average 1.8% annually in 2024-27, below the averages for Latin American and emerging markets. Higher social spending and minimum-wage rises will put a floor under private consumption and support GDP growth, but fiscal and debt dynamics will not be strong enough to bring down local financing costs substantially, weighing on investment. Although this will be partly offset by higher state-bank lending, if Lula's interventionist policies create more market distortions than we anticipate, growth will come in below these expectations.
On the supply side, agriculture and mining exports will rise in line with the increase in global demand over the 2023-27 forecast period. Manufacturing and services growth will slow in 2023, owing to high interest rates and weak consumption, before picking up thereafter. As the boost from Brazil's post-pandemic economic reopening is now over, services will expand more modestly, following consumption trends.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The agriculture sector is more important than its small share of GDP (7.7% in 2022) suggests, owing to its significance as an employer in rural areas and the importance of agri-business industries for the domestic market and exports. Favourable weather and investments led to record grains harvests of about 273m tonnes in 2021/22. The sector will remain vulnerable to adverse weather (particularly the cyclical El Niño weather phenomenon in 2023/24) but will benefit from technological improvements and more intensive land use, as well as from good fundamentals for soft-commodity exports, owing to rising demand in the developing world.
El Niño poses risks to agricultural output for the 2023/24 harvest After drought conditions caused agricultural output to contract in 2020/21, the 2021/22 harvest broke records, even though the Russia-Ukraine war put pressure on global supply chains and raised fertiliser costs (Russia has traditionally been a major supplier for Brazil). Although war-related supply-chain constraints still exist, the initial shock has faded, and the government has been able to secure sufficient supplies of fertilisers. As a result, the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Conab, the supply company) forecasts that the 2022/23 harvest will increase by 15%, to a new record of 314m tonnes, despite El Niño weather conditions. Our baseline assumption is that, although the El Niño phenomenon will develop, it will not curb agricultural output significantly in the 2023/24 harvest. However, we note the risk that El Niño's effects prove stronger than we expect, bringing drought to the North and Northeast regions and heavy rains to the South. Depending on their intensity, those conditions could subdue agricultural output 2023/24.
The Lula administration understands the importance of agriculture to the Brazilian economy and will support its growth. However, the government's ambitions to strengthen environmental policy will create some nodes of divergence with the agricultural sector. One of these relates to deforestation, which is practised legally and illegally as a way of preparing and expanding crop and pasture areas. According to MapBiomas, a local environmental non-governmental organisation, 96% of legal and illegal deforestation in Brazil in 2022 was directly or indirectly caused by agriculture. Lula's efforts to step up monitoring to prevent illegal deforestation will delay the authorisation process for legal deforestation and therefore pose a downside risk to agricultural output.
Land reform is another contentious area. In the first months of 2023 the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST, a group of rural workers who advocate for land redistribution) occupied several properties that it deemed unproductive. To appease the MST (a PT constituency), the Lula administration has announced a mini land-redistribution programme. Although details have not yet been announced, the government guarantees that it will respect private property, as it will only distribute land that has already been expropriated and has not yet been directed for land reform (Mr Bolsonaro halted all land redistributions). Lula's proximity to the MST is likely to revive the movement, but we expect him to remain pragmatic as he seeks to balance the group's interests with those of the agri-business sector.
Manufacturing will be constrained by competitiveness weaknesses The outlook for manufacturing is clouded by poor competitiveness-an issue that has plagued the sector for many years and has caused its share of total GDP to fall from 15% in 2000 to 11% currently. This decline is partly due to import competition-the Real was overvalued in 2005-12, during the commodity boom-and also reflects Brazil's high interest rates. Persistent weaknesses in the manufacturing industry include a heavy tax burden, poor infrastructure and high labour costs.
Light manufacturing in particular has lost market share in recent years, owing to a surge in Chinese imports. Capital goods industries have faced similar problems but will be buoyed by domestic demand. Higher investment will enable some labour-intensive manufacturing activities to move up the value chain, but many will struggle to cope with rising import competition. Brazil's manufacturing sector has been mostly inward-looking and most firms have failed to develop linkages with global production chains. Nearshoring in Brazil has been limited. The country's distance from developed markets makes it a less attractive nearshoring option than Mexico, for example, which has a similarly sophisticated industrial complex but benefits from geographical proximity to the US.
The vehicles and parts industry, which accounts for about one-fifth of manufacturing and provides employment for about 1.2m people, has been facing rough conditions amid global semiconductor shortages that began in 2021 and will keep production subdued this year. The Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores (Anfavea, the automotive industry body) estimates that the shortage caused a loss in production of about 300,000 units last year, as global automakers allocated scarce supplies to their home markets and to markets with higher profit margins. We expect Brazil's annual vehicle output to recover to 2019 levels by 2024, but it will remain far below the 2012 peak of 3.4m units as the semiconductor shortage continues. The electric-vehicle (EV) subsector is still nascent in Brazil; production is limited to commercial vehicles, batteries and some parts. However, there is significant investment in the sector, including US$600m from China's BYD (the world's largest electric car-maker), which aims to establish a manufacturing plant for electric passenger and commercial vehicles in Brazil by end-2024.
Extractive industries will continue to perform reasonably well in the medium term. China's economic reopening (following the lifting of its zero-covid policy) will support mining activity (notably iron ore) in the short term, but that country's secular economic slowdown will dampen the long-term outlook for Brazil's export commodities. Reforms to the mining law in 2018 that increased royalties for the government and improved the regulatory framework will boost investment in other mining activities. In 2022 the government eased regulations on lithium (which was previously considered a strategic metal), making exports of lithium viable. Brazil currently accounts for about 1.5% of global lithium production, but the Serviço Geológico do Brasil (SGB, the geological service) projects that the country could raise its share to 5% over the next ten years.
Investment into oil and gas will continue to boost the sector's growth Huge oil and gas reserves could turn Brazil into one of the world's top ten oil exporters. According to BP's 2022 Statistical Review of World Energy, Brazil had the second-largest oil reserves in South America as at end-2020, with 11.9bn barrels, or 0.7% of the global total (after Venezuela, with 303.8bn barrels, or 17.5% of the total). We estimate that Brazil's output of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) increased by 4.4% year on year in 2022, to 3.8m barrels/day. Petrobras, the state-controlled oil firm, is the market leader; it accounted for more than 90% of Brazilian oil production in 2022. In 2022 Brazil had 19 refineries with a combined capacity of 2.4m b/d and actual refined oil output of 1.9m b/d. Under Mr Bolsonaro, Petrobras committed to divesting eight of its 13 refineries by end-2021, but by November 2022 the company had sold just one. Lula will halt these privatisation efforts, owing to his preference for statist economic policies. We expect oil and gas production to surge later in the forecast period, boosted by significant investments in Brazil's offshore pre-salt areas (where significant reserves are held beneath thick layers of salt under the seabed).
Services sector is unlikely to recover much dynamism The services sector is unlikely to recover much dynamism in the medium term, as it is impaired by low productivity and skills shortages. However, retail, financial services, ICT and trade will outperform the sector's average in the medium term.
Retail sales volume growth will be muted in 2023, owing to high interest rates and the lifting of tax breaks that were introduced in 2021-22. The picture will improve slightly in the second half of the year as interest rates and inflation ease, but more robust growth can only be expected after 2024 as economic conditions improve. Many consumers have traded down in recent years but will continue to shop across different channels, which poses challenges for retailers. Convenience stores will remain popular across income groups in urban areas, but young adults are increasingly making purchases using mobile internet devices.

Inflation has subsided in Brazil, but remains above target, and further disinflation is unlikely in the near term. Core inflation is still running at more than 7%, and future inflation expectations are adrift of targets. Moreover, some pre-election tax cuts in July-September 2022 will be reversed; as this decline in prices works its way out of the 12-month series, inflation will actually rise from 4.2% in April to 5.8% at end-2023, before dipping below 4% after end-2024. However, there are risks to this forecast, owing to investor concerns that the monetary council may raise its inflation targets, which would lift inflation expectations. In the event of an upward revision, we would promptly lift our inflation forecasts for the remaining years of the outlook period, to 4-5%.

The Real has been volatile in recent months, owing to various local and global developments, although it has strengthened since the government unveiled its fiscal framework proposals in March, as its intention to retain caps on spending growth calmed investor jitters about the risk of fiscal expansion. The bigger picture is that US dollar strength appears to have peaked as the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) pauses its tightening cycle, helping the value of other currencies. Support from the carry trade will fade as the Selic rate declines, which means that, having strengthened from R5.2:US$1 at end-2022 to R5:US$1 on May 18th, we expect the Real to weaken slightly in the second half of the year. If an upward revision to inflation targets raises expectations and outcomes considerably, the currency will weaken more than we envisage. If, however, any adjustments to the targets are marginal and the government delivers stronger primary balances than we expect, the Real could appreciate more markedly. Overall, we anticipate that the Real will strengthen modestly in the 2023-27 forecast period, albeit with bouts of volatility.

Lower commodity prices and higher imports will erode Brazil's trade surplus, which was inflated in 2022 by surging oil and soybean prices. This will cause the current-account deficit to expand from 2.6% of GDP in 2023 to an average of 3.1% of GDP in 2025-27. Firm foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will cover the shortfall, reflecting sizeable market opportunities. Brazil's structural trade surplus (stemming from its huge agricultural exports), modest external debt ratio and comfortable reserves cushion will limit risks to the external position. Public external debt is low, and most firms have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. Exports of agri-goods and minerals to China and other countries will keep the trade account in surplus throughout 2023-27.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Brazil Stocks and flows Brazil is one of the largest recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Latin America and ranks among the top ten in the world. In 2022 total FDI inflows (including intercompany transfers and reinvested profits) jumped to an estimated US$91.5bn, or 4.8% of GDP. The 2022 figure is the highest since 2014 (the peak of the boom years), when inflows totalled US$96.9bn. Total FDI inflows fell to an average of US$74bn in 2015-19, before plummeting further in the 2020-21 pandemic years, to an average of US$42bn. By end-2022 the FDI stock had reached an estimated US$1trn (54% of GDP).
Origin and distribution US and European companies (together accounting for 78% of total FDI inflows in 2022) have traditionally been the biggest investors, but Chinese companies have entered the market in recent years, acquiring assets in electricity, infrastructure, oil and services, taking that country's share of total FDI inflows from 0.9% in 2012 to 2.6% in 2022. Other countries that invest significantly in Brazil are Singapore, Chile, Uruguay and Japan. Inward FDI is fairly well distributed across agriculture (1.3% of total FDI inflows in 2022), extractive industries (13%), manufacturing (42%) and services (44%), reflecting opportunities in Brazil's broad-based economy.
Determinants Brazil's attractiveness to foreign investors has generally rested on the combination of its market size, macroeconomic stability, richness of natural resources and diversified industrial base. The country is a major global player in agri-business, mineral commodities and bioenergy. However, its complex tax system, relatively unstable legal framework and high borrowing costs have precluded higher inflows of FDI.
Impact FDI has played an increasingly prominent role in recent infrastructure concessions and in pre-salt oil rounds. In this sense, FDI is an important success factor in the promotion of capital productivity and sustained long-term growth. From a balance-of-payments perspective, FDI has fully covered the current-account deficit in recent years, allowing a healthy and balanced exchange between Brazil and the rest of the world. Although it is hard to measure the direct effects of FDI on productivity, it is clear that there is a positive correlation between the presence of international companies operating in Brazil and research and development activity: patents for inventions filed by non-residents through Brazilian offices reached 19,566 in 2021, far exceeding the 4,666 patents filed by residents.
Potential Brazil will remain an attractive destination for foreign investors in EIU's 2023-27 forecast period owing to its large market, but the favourable external environment last year-a product of high commodity prices, which buoyed interest in the country's export-oriented extractive industries and agriculture-will turn less supportive as commodity prices soften. We expect the government to pass tax reform within the forecast period, combining separate federal, state and municipal taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT). This should dramatically simplify the country's complex tax system-considered one of the major barriers to investment. However, FDI inflows will remain below potential, as privatisation opportunities have evaporated now that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has returned to the presidency. There is a risk that Lula could reverse some important privatisations (such as that of Eletrobras, a power firm), although this is not our baseline assumption.

An ageing population-the result of a declining birth rate and increasing life expectancy-will dampen Brazil's GDP growth potential. Preliminary results from the 2022 census (the scheduled 2020 census was delayed because of the covid-19 pandemic) show that adverse demographic trends have accelerated since the last census, which was taken in 2010. The census puts the population at 207.8m in 2022, much lower than the 214.8m previously estimated by the national statistics institute (IBGE). Final census results are due to be released at end-June; if the difference of 7m people is confirmed, there would be significant demographic implications that would affect EIU's long-term GDP growth forecasts.
A rising old-age dependency ratio will put pressure on Brazil's pension system Brazil's demographic dividend will end soon, which will oblige the government to tackle the fiscal burden of an ageing population. There were 49.1m people in the country aged 0-14 (25.2% of the population) in 2010. We estimate that the share of the population in that age bracket had fallen by 4.7 percentage points, to 44m (20.5% of the population), by 2022. Over the same period the share of elderly people (those aged over 65) rose from 6.8% to 9.6%. Based on our current projections, the share of the population in that bracket will increase by another 1.8 percentage points, to 12% by 2027. For comparison, the OECD average for the share of the population aged over 65 will rise from 18% in 2022 to 19.8% in 2027.
The ratio of the working-age population (15-64 years) to the total population is peaking; it has risen from 68% in 2010 to 69.9% in 2022, but we expect it to slip to 68.7% in 2027; as a result, we forecast that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of elderly people to working-age people) will reach 18% in 2027, from 15% in 2022. For comparison, the old-age dependency ratio for the average OECD country will rise from an estimated 32.4% in 2022 to 36.2% in 2027. This means that Brazilian workers will come under much stronger pressure to finance the increasing number of pension beneficiaries. Productivity gains in the labour market will be insufficient to make up for this extra burden, as the education and skills levels of the workforce are low, and are unlikely to improve significantly over the next decade.
Solving the pension system imbalance by raising taxes or through labour contributions would be costly and counterproductive. Brazil's tax burden is already heavy; additional tax increases would raise production costs, reduce the unemployment rate and ultimately limit consumption growth and revenue collection. In sum, Brazil's demographic transition will challenge the fiscal and financial sustainability of the country's current pay-as-you-go pension system, even after a landmark pension reform that was passed in 2019. Another attempt at reform-to either the raise retirement age, cut benefits or both-will be needed in the next five to ten years and will raise the risk of social unrest.
The growing share of older people will weigh on the public healthcare system Population ageing affects not only the social security system, but also the healthcare system, as it increases medical and hospital costs. Brazil has one of the largest public healthcare systems in the world. The 1988 constitution made healthcare universal and decentralised (basic care is the responsibility of municipalities, and more intensive and complex procedures fall under the purview of Brazil's states). However, even before covid-19, the system was overstretched owing to growing demand, particularly after the 2014-16 economic crisis, when many people migrated from private healthcare insurance (mostly through company schemes) to public health services. Population ageing will exacerbate the situation, stretching already-thin budgets.
Labour productivity needs to rise to compensate for demographic trends Given the speed of the demographic transition and the pressure that it will put on the pension and healthcare systems, labour productivity would have to rise significantly in the long term to compensate for the rising old-age dependency ratio. The education system remains precarious and is unable to produce enough skilled workers, even though Brazil spends 6% of its GDP on education (above the OECD average of 3.4% of GDP in 2019). Immigration could go some way towards offsetting population ageing, but the government has not laid out any policies to attract skilled labour and is unlikely to do so in the near future. Most recent immigrants to Brazil (primarily from South Korea, China, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela) have been absorbed into low-skilled roles in the retail sector, rather than into industry, where most demand for high-skilled labour is to be found.

Brazil fell out of the list of the world's top ten largest economies (at market exchange rates) in 2020 owing to the covid-19 pandemic; however, EIU expects it to return to this elite group in 2024. Brazil's GDP recovered to just under US$2.1trn in 2023, making it the world's eleventh-biggest economy, behind Canada. Based on a population of about 210m people (the seventh-largest population globally), we forecast that GDP per head will come in at US$9,890 (at market exchange rates) in 2023. We expect GDP per head measured by market rates to exceed US$10,000 by 2024, making Brazil an upper-middle-income country and the 60th-70th richest in the world (depending on the metrics used).
When measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, per-head income is higher and will rise from US$19,580 in 2023 to US$22,430 by 2027. The divergence between GDP per head measured by market rates and by purchasing power parity reflects the fact that, in emerging economies such as Brazil, lower wages make prices of services and non-traded goods relatively cheap by comparison with richer countries. Given that services represent more than 70% of GDP, per-head income measured by the PPP exchange rate tends to be higher than at the market exchange rate.
Household consumption is high, but savings are low The relatively low median personal disposable income (forecast at US$1,453 in 2023) results in a high marginal propensity to spend more and save less. According to a 2023 study by the Associação Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais (Anbima, the financial and capital markets association), 63.8% of Brazilians do not have any financial investments, a rise from 56% in 2019, as the pandemic prompted households to liquidate investments. The high share of income diverted to consumption means that household consumption represents about 63% of the country's total GDP. Government consumption is fairly high for a developing country, at nearly 18% of GDP. Meanwhile, savings and investments are low, with gross fixed investments representing only 18% of GDP. Even in families who save some of their income, most allocate it in conservative instruments, primarily savings accounts with low or below-inflation interest rates (real savings interest rates are negative). A lack of knowledge about financial products also explains the low levels of savings; most families do not receive much extra income from financial returns.
Low savings rates stifle local investment resources Low levels of savings reduce the amount of financial guarantees and collateral that households can use to borrow from banks. This is partly why total domestic credit extended by banks to the private sector represents nearly 70% of GDP in Brazil. Consumption is concentrated on goods and services that are less dependent on credit, such as non-durable goods (food and beverages, and health and beauty products) and semi-durable goods (clothing, household goods and electronic equipment). Consumption of durable goods, such as automobiles and housing (which often rely on access to financing), have been dependent on government stimulus programmes, as illustrated in consumer and credit trends during the boom and bust cycle of 2003-14. These patterns are also reflected in e-commerce. Even though the covid-19 pandemic has propelled digital growth, consumer behaviour has changed little. The share of online retail sales in total retail sales has been increasing gradually, from 5.2% in 2019 to a forecast 6.5% in 2023. We expect this trend to continue, with online sales accounting for 7.3% the total by the end of our 2023-27 forecast period. Online purchases of groceries and staples will drive much of this growth.

Corporate and household balance sheets will suffer amid a tepid recovery The complete reopening of the economy and spending prior to the 2022 general election helped GDP to expand by 2.9% in 2022, but a global economic slowdown and fiscal constraints will cause growth to ease to 1.7% this year. Pronounced income disparities make for regional variation in growth dynamics. Brazil is made up of 26 states-plus the capital district of Brasília-divided into five regions. The wealthy southern states will do better than the rest, given that they specialise in agro-industry, which will hold up better than manufacturing and services. Similarly, the Centre-West-Brazil's agricultural belt-specialises in livestock, grains (soybean and corn) and cotton, which will be resilient in the long term. The Southeast region, home to Brazil's largest city, São Paulo, will benefit from its diversified industrial, agricultural and services base. Meanwhile, the poorer North and Northeast regions will suffer from a lack of skilled labour and weak infrastructure, although the industrial production of durable and semi-durable goods in the Manaus Free-Trade Zone (in the North) and agriculture and mining (in the Northeast) will support growth.

EIU expects Brazil's annual GDP growth to slip to 1.7% on average in the long-term forecast period (2031-50), largely owing to the end of the country's demographic dividend. Growth will therefore be much weaker than in 1991-2014, when a low base (following a recession and a period of hyperinflation in the 1980s) and the commodities boom of the 2000s and 2010s produced average growth of 3%. Our growth forecast for 2031-50 assumes that labour productivity growth will accelerate beyond recent historical levels but that it will be offset by worsening demographic factors. Our model also assumes that growth in the capital stock and in total factor productivity will accelerate amid improvements in innovation and technology. Faster growth could be achieved if policy improvements and structural reforms exceed expectations.
Initial conditions: Brazil has vast natural resource potential and a young labour force, but structural constraints-including weak political effectiveness, generally low levels of education and skills, income disparities, low savings rates, chronic underinvestment in infrastructure and heavy public debt-will erode these advantages. Other than in the agricultural sector, productivity growth has been disappointing in recent years, even though the manufacturing sector took advantage of exchange-rate appreciation during the boom years to increase imports of more advanced machinery and equipment. Gradual improvements in the quality and availability of primary and secondary education, as well as efforts to address infrastructure deficiencies, simplify the convoluted tax system and reduce red tape, will underpin stronger productivity growth in the long term. Our projections are based on the expectation that a commitment to macroeconomic discipline will prevail.
Demographic trends: Brazil's demographic dividend is close to ending, and policymakers will therefore have to address the fiscal burden of an ageing population. Brazil's demographic profile will become less supportive of growth prospects as the population ages, but the median age of the population will still be low compared with the US, western European countries and Japan. Population growth will begin to outpace working-age growth early in the 2020s, meaning that policymakers will need to revise the pension system in order to alleviate the burden on the public finances.
External conditions: Brazil's economy is exposed to changes in external financial market conditions owing to its low domestic savings rates, and the volume of external capital inflows is strongly correlated with risk aversion. Although the public sector has been cautious about external borrowing, corporates have borrowed overseas and can be affected by sudden stops in capital flows. Progress on increasing trade openness and diversifying export partners will allow the country to benefit from global trade growth. Brazil's strong competitive advantage in agricultural production and its large industrial export base provide some insulation from commodity price shocks. Global trade liberalisation is unlikely to make much headway; combined with rising international pressure to contain deforestation, this will prevent Brazil from realising its full export potential, particularly in the agricultural sector.
Institutions and policy trends: Brazil's democracy has strengthened since the reinstatement of civilian rule in 1985. However, many political institutions are still ineffective, and the political spectrum is fragmented into several relatively weak parties, producing a legislature that is dominated by vested interests. The situation will improve slightly, assuming that efforts to enhance party loyalty and electoral measures to reduce the number of political parties in Congress eventually materialise. Fiscal pressures will mount, despite efforts to pass reforms to cap the growth of spending related to benefits and entitlements enshrined in the 1988 constitution, especially as the population ages. Tax revenue is already high, at 25% of GDP, which means that adjusting the public finances to stabilise and reduce Brazil's high public debt/GDP ratio (estimated at 72.9% in 2022) will prove challenging. A heavy debt burden will keep interest payments high, crowding out the private sector. Our long-term growth forecasts assume slow improvements in the business environment through the gradual (albeit uneven) implementation of structural reforms, which will help to compensate for other constraints on GDP growth, including the convoluted tax system, infrastructure shortcomings and labour market weaknesses. We expect these measures to start to improve Brazil's relative attractiveness for investors only after 2030.
Long-term performance: Brazil will struggle to gain much ground on the US; its GDP per head (in US dollars at purchasing power parity) will amount to 25% of the US's figure in 2050. Although macroeconomic stability will reduce volatility in economic growth, our forecast for GDP expansion of a lacklustre 1.7% per year in the 2023-50 long-term forecast period will be weaker than the average in 1991-2014 (3%). Improvements in infrastructure, trade expansion, a broader presence of multinational businesses and a reduction in the debt-service burden will mitigate slower labour force growth and should help to lift labour productivity growth. However, this depends on progress in the politically difficult process of structural and institutional reforms.
Our outlook is based on the assumption that governments remain broadly committed to pushing through changes in the long term: otherwise, productivity growth and average GDP growth rates will fall short of our already-lacklustre forecasts. The country's political system makes it hard to advance structural reforms. Political reforms could improve the situation, although these appear intractable. Given that our forecasts already account for the commercial exploitation of the proceeds of Brazil's huge reserves of deepwater oil, major setbacks in this regard would pose a downside risk to our projections. Our forecasts now capture the impact of climate change; we believe that Brazil's GDP in 2050 will be 4% smaller than it would have been without this constraint on growth.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Environmental protection is back on track, but risks remain Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of weather events, be they droughts or floods. For Brazil, adverse weather conditions will directly affect long-term growth in view of the importance of agriculture to the economy. Industry and services are also at risk; as seen in 2020-21, severe droughts can disrupt activity, given that hydroelectric power accounts for a large share (nearly 57%) of Brazil's energy matrix. In addition, more than a quarter of the Brazilian population lives on the coast, meaning that rising sea levels could cause mass migration and catastrophic infrastructure damage. As home to 60% of the Amazon (the world's largest rainforest), Brazil has a leading role in combating climate change-a mantle that it has taken up again with the return of the left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, to power in January 2023.
Lula is reversing the anti-environmental policies of his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), and has promised to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030. To that end, Lula has reinforced monitoring and introduced punitive measures against those engaging in illegal deforestation. Early indications are that his efforts are paying off; according to the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, the space research institute), illegal deforestation in the Amazon region had declined by 40% in January-April 2023 from the same period a year earlier.
Lula's other measures to reduce deforestation include re-establishing the Amazon Fund (suspended in 2019), through which some Western countries sponsor the preservation of the rainforest. He also has removed expenditure related to international donations for the environment from his new fiscal spending cap rules and is increasing the number of public servants in important environmental agencies.
The international community has welcomed Lula's efforts, and European countries now appear more interest in moving ahead with the long-delayed free-trade agreement between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs bloc, of which Brazil is a leading member). Another boost for Lula's environmental credentials came with the selection of Belém, the capital of Pará state (in the Amazon region), as the host for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) conference, which will take place in 2025. This will be Brazil's first opportunity to host a COP summit and symbolises the country's return to the international stage as an important actor in the fight against climate change.
EIU expects Lula to take a more pragmatic approach to Brazil's critical agricultural sector by promoting a more sustainable environmental agenda while still supporting agri-business. However, risks to Lula's support for the agricultural sector have risen following land invasions by the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST, a group of rural workers who advocate for land redistribution) in early 2023. Given that the MST is an important constituency for Lula's party, he may make further concessions to them, or their movement may gain momentum, raising risks to political stability. However, these invasions have antagonised the agriculture sector; if actions like this continue, Lula may come under pressure to loosen environmental regulations.
New innovations in fintech offer opportunities for growth and financial inclusion A technological revolution in Brazil's financial sector will support the country's long-term growth and open up new avenues for innovation in e-commerce. Open-banking reforms and the launch of Pix (an electronic payments system) in November 2020 by the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) will provide opportunities for increased competition in Brazil's highly concentrated banking system and promote financial inclusion.
The BCB has made financial inclusion and competition central pillars of its agenda. There are now about 148m Pix user accounts-a sign of strong demand-and the daily average volume of transactions in April was about R40bn (US$7.8bn). Pix, which allows individuals to make instant digital payments and money transfers for free (companies pay a small fee), will dent traditional bank profits by almost eliminating fees from wire transfers, still widely used in Brazil.
Another important development since the pandemic has been a decrease in the unbanked population-from 22.7m at end-2019 to about 20m as at January 2023, according to the BCB-as more than 40m Brazilians received covid-19 assistance payments digitally, through their Caixa Econômica Federal bank accounts. The unbanked population will continue shrinking as the shift to digital payment and banking services facilitates access. Rather than stoking zero-sum competition between brick-and-mortar operations and digital start-ups, the implementation of open banking should drive synergies between the two as traditional banks share data and collaborate with third-party institutions. The star of the fintech scene in Brazil has been Nubank, a digital bank. Having started as a provider of no-fee credit cards, it is now a full bank offering current accounts, loans and investment products. Nubank had 80m customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia as at April 2023; Morgan Stanley (a US bank) projects a dramatic compound annual revenue growth rate of 68% through to 2025.
Looking ahead, open-banking regulations are likely to follow, and the BCB governor, Roberto Campos Neto, has gone so far as to suggest the creation of a digital currency. Nonetheless, there are some risks to that should be considered. Fintech firms, which have been allowed to provide direct credit services since 2018, may not have the risk management systems and practices in place that incumbent financial firms have, which could present risks to financial stability. Indeed, Nubank's non-performing loan (NPL) ratio reached 5.5% in March, whereas the national rate stood at 3.3%. Moreover, increased digitalisation and connectivity expose operators and consumers to cyber-security risk; active risk management is required so that cyber-security measures are commensurate with the underlying risk. In March 2022 the BCB issued a new set of fintech regulations covering payment firms-its first update to important rules for the sector in nine years to spur competition in the space and rein in riskier business structures.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - EIU expects the president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party, to govern as a lame duck until his term ends in 2025. However, the risk of him leaving office early is very high, given a hostile opposition in the unicameral National Assembly (in which Creo has a legislative minority) and strong social discontent. Mr Lasso could pre-empt a move to oust him by using a constitutional provision to dissolve the legislature, but that would trigger an early general election (and probably protests too). Even assuming that he remains in power, progress on his market-friendly policy agenda will slow to a crawl, given his weak political mandate. We expect his successor to encounter similar challenges-namely a weak, fragmented party system and social unrest-in advancing their agenda. Moreover, there is a high risk that the next administration will be less fiscally disciplined. These factors will keep political instability high in the 2023-27 forecast period.

- Ecuador's performance in our business environment rankings improves only modestly in 2023-27, reflecting the stagnation of progress on Mr Lasso's reform agenda amid political and social turmoil. Strident opposition from well-organised indigenous groups and the opposition-dominated Congress will severely constrain attempts to implement market-friendly reforms. Structural weaknesses, such as inadequate access to local finance and Ecuador's small market size, will also prove limiting factors and will be difficult for the government to tackle.

Exchange rate US$:US$ (av) 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0

- Ecuador's real GDP growth will slow to 1.3% in 2023. Private consumption expansion will soften as higher domestic interest rates weigh on consumer credit and a global slowdown subdues remittances growth. The government's budgetary constraints will also limit public consumption and investment. The recovery in 2024-27 will be mild, with growth averaging 2% per year; policy uncertainty and stretched public finances will weigh on investment, limiting employment and private consumption growth. Dollarisation provides a basis for macroeconomic stability and will help to keep inflation low, but a more robust economic growth trajectory is unlikely without a significant increase in private-sector investment. The government will continue fiscal consolidation efforts, but public debt will remain burdensome, and political instability will sustain risks that fiscal prudence is abandoned, which could in turn make it difficult to secure external financing.

Population growth   1.4 1.0
Working-age population growth   1.62 1.11
Labour force growth   0.7 2.6

- A falling birth rate will cause population growth to slow to an annual average rate of 1% in 2023-27-in line with regional standards. Labour force growth will still outstrip population growth, sustaining a demographic dividend throughout the forecast period. However, this trend will weaken over the next decade, complicating prospects for Ecuador's convergence with more developed economies in the region.

Household consumption per head (US$) 3,850 3,970 4,050 4,110 4,160 4,220

- Ecuador is one of the smaller markets in our business environment rankings. The slow recovery of the domestic market from the pandemic-induced recession is unlikely to pick up significantly, as there are signs of permanent damage to household incomes (they only surpassed 2019 levels in 2022). Significant mineral reserves will attract oil and mining investors, but opportunities outside these sectors will remain restricted by low purchasing power (in terms of GDP per head). Persistent income inequality and poverty will also hinder robust growth in household consumption.

Growth of real GDP 1.8 1.7 1.7
Labour productivity growth 0.2 1.3 1.0

- Low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador's GDP per head to catch up with more developed countries, provided that policies are implemented to transform its resource wealth into productive investment in other sectors. Ecuador will benefit from its dollarised system and from incremental improvements to the business environment. However, the prospects for strengthening institutions are meagre, which bodes poorly for a more stable economic policy direction. Assuming that structural weaknesses, obstacles to governability and inconsistent policymaking continue to present challenges, long-term investment will be low and incomes will remain below OECD levels.

a Actual.
Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. Three presidents have been ousted by popular protests amid economic shocks since 1997. Ecuador's longest-serving president, the left-wing Rafael Correa (2007-17), was succeeded by Lenín Moreno (2017-21), who introduced a series of constitutional reforms, including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for presidents. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, the current president, Guillermo Lasso, who took office in May 2021, has continued to face social and fiscal challenges.
Political structure: Ecuador has a presidential system. The president and the 137 members of the unicameral National Assembly are elected for four-year terms, with a two-term limit. The 2008 constitution increased executive power and allowed the president to fast-track economic legislation, but a fragmented political landscape and the latent threat of widespread protests severely hinder governability. Although it is formally independent, the judiciary is politicised.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided a degree of macroeconomic stability but has also exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitiveness and has not precluded fiscal imbalances. Indeed, Ecuador struggled when the commodity supercycle ended, triggering a sharp decline in government revenue just when spending was at a record high. Covid-19 raised the imperative to strengthen the public finances: in 2020 the Moreno government secured a US$6.5bn extended fund facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF that aimed to support fiscal consolidation and structural reform, and which the Lasso administration successfully completed. Recent consolidation efforts and a fresh rise in oil prices have shored up the fiscal accounts, but social spending pressures still pose a challenge to long-term sustainability. Fuel subsidies, which rose after the Russia-Ukraine war and domestic protests broke out last year, are a particularly heavy fiscal burden, but there is strong social and political opposition to removing them.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded a trade surplus of US$2.5bn in 2022; petrol export earnings averaged 35% of total export revenue, compared with more than 50% during the commodity boom in the 2000s.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party, took office in May 2021 for a four-year term, after winning a run-off election against Andrés Arauz of the leftist Unión por la Esperanza (UNES), which is the continuation of the political movement led by a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17). The unicameral 137-seat National Assembly is fragmented and dominated by left-of-centre parties. Mr Lasso's party has just 12 seats as part of the Bancada del Acuerdo Nacional (BAN) bloc, which has made it difficult to forge a governing coalition. The largest party and main opposition force in Congress is UNES, followed by the indigenous Movimiento de Unidad Plurinacional Pachakutik (Pachakutik), which also opposes the government's pro-market reform agenda. The conservative Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) and centre-left Izquierda Democrática (ID) are next in terms of representation. Party loyalties are weak; legislators often vote against party lines, switch party allegiances or leave to become independents, which makes governability extremely difficult.

Political outlook: Political stability The risk of Mr Lasso being ousted has increased following a referendum and concurrent regional and local elections that were held in February. In a major blow to the president, voters rejected all of his reform proposals in a clear signal of their discontent with his administration. Moreover, correísmo (Mr Correa's hard-left political movement) emerged stronger from the referendum and elections. Although we still expect Mr Lasso to remain in power (albeit as a lame duck) until his term ends in 2025, there is a very high risk that the opposition-dominated Congress ousts him, or that he feels compelled to call early elections.
The opposition is leveraging a corruption and influence-peddling scandal allegedly involving Mr Lasso's brother-in-law, Danilo Carrera, to seek an impeachment vote against Mr Lasso (both Mr Carrera and the president deny wrongdoing). However, the independent Constitutional Court must first approve the procedure before a vote is held, and may block it, arguing that there is insufficient evidence implicating the president. Alternatively, Congress could seek to "dismiss" the president (a different procedure to impeachment). Although in principle the constitution permits lawmakers a single dismissal vote per presidential term (Mr Lasso narrowly survived one in 2022), the hardline opposition may push for an alternative interpretation of the regulations-a plausible scenario, given its control over the leadership positions in Congress and its strong representation there (it can generally count on support from 62 of the 137 lawmakers, whereas Mr Lasso can only rely on 12).
In parallel, there is now an increased risk that the president, should he face the threat of imminent removal, dissolves the legislature (which the constitution allows him to do in the event of a political crisis). However, he will be reluctant to use this mechanism, as it would also trigger a new general election, in which he would most likely perform poorly, considering the recent referendum result.
Social unrest-aggravated by high living costs, increased violent crime and the president's fragile standing-is exacerbating political instability. The government had to offer major concessions (including fuel subsidies and a moratorium on new oil and mining projects) to end a wave of protests in June 2022 led by the Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (Conaie, the country's largest indigenous organisation). Conaie has publicly called on Congress to impeach Mr Lasso and is threatening a new strike to secure further concessions. We expect social tensions to remain high under Mr Lasso, to the detriment of governability. Unrest also poses risks to our growth and fiscal forecasts, as the beleaguered government may end up yielding once again to protesters' demands for increased subsidies and tighter restrictions on extractive industries.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Politicised institutions, corruption, an inefficient bureaucracy and a complex, archaic tax system have long undermined institutional effectiveness. Although constitutional amendments in 2008 and 2015 tilted discretional power in the executive's favour, they did little to improve political effectiveness and reduced accountability. The fragmented party system and the fact that various groups can in effect veto government policies have undermined political effectiveness since Ecuador became a presidential democracy in 1979.
In view of these persistent structural weaknesses in Ecuadorean politics, we expect governability to remain weak in 2023-27. Unlike the last two presidents, Mr Lasso lacks a single-party majority in Congress, which restricts progress on his reform agenda. Prospects for any fundamental improvement in political effectiveness under the next administration (due to sit in 2025-29) are weak, as the fragmented political landscape bodes ill for executive-legislative relations.
Reflecting the structural fragility of political coalitions and Mr Lasso's own limited political skills, two government-backed coalitions have fallen apart during his term. Amid the turmoil, a number of opposition parties-including UNES, the PSC and dissident members of Pachakutik and ID-have formed an ad hoc majority opposition coalition of their own, undermining the Lasso administration's efforts to formulate and execute policy.
The constitution grants the president significant powers-including vetoes and executive decrees-that he is leveraging increasingly to fend off legislative attacks. In the short run, the continued (and probably increased) use of executive decrees could enable Mr Lasso and his successors to push ahead with at least some of their agenda, despite lawmakers' objections. However, doing so could fuel opposition sentiment and, over the long term, result in policy deadlock, with each side constantly trying to overturn the other's initiatives.
In addition to a weak party system, there are other structural factors that pose serious challenges to political and institutional effectiveness: the bureaucracy is inefficient; policymaking is subject to the demands of an array of vested interests; and law enforcement is inadequate. These issues are compounded by bouts of social unrest, which are a threat not just to political stability but also to political effectiveness. Social groups are well organised and have sometimes succeeded in reversing or blocking the implementation of government policy. For example, indigenous groups managed to oust the three presidents who came before Mr Correa; there is a risk that Mr Lasso becomes the fourth. He has already been forced to backtrack on his market-friendly reform agenda after protests broke out in June 2022, for example by increasing fuel subsidies and adopting a moratorium on new oil and mining licences. A similar episode occurred in October 2019, under his predecessor, Lenín Moreno (2017-21). These groups will continue to undermine Mr Lasso's policy agenda and that of the next president.
Corruption is another factor that will weigh on political effectiveness. Progress on tackling this issue has been marginal at best under Mr Lasso. He has reinstated the cabinet-level anti-corruption secretariat (following its dissolution in 2020) and the body has now developed a national anti-corruption strategy, but its implementation activities have been limited. On a positive note, anti-money-laundering reforms will tighten financial reporting requirements for legislators and political parties, which could help to uncover cases of embezzlement. This measure will build on reforms that the Moreno administration adopted to reduce political interference by the judiciary and curb graft. However, we expect overall progress on reducing corruption to be limited by weaknesses in policymaking and implementation capacity. Previous initiatives have yielded few tangible results, and Mr Lasso's fragile legislative position will get in the way of efforts to advance anti-corruption legislation that the opposition deems controversial (as also occurred under Mr Moreno). The misuse of funds in public institutions and networks of corruption within the state, including the judicial system, will be exceedingly difficult to root out.
Political outlook: Election watch The next national elections (presidential and legislative) are not due until 2025. There is a high risk that political instability will force them to be brought forward, although this is not our baseline forecast. Regardless of whether they are held in 2025 or earlier, there is now a stronger likelihood that widespread disapproval of the Lasso administration will precipitate a shift back towards leftist politics. Against this backdrop, the correísta opposition, which lost in the second round of the 2021 presidential election, has a solid basis from which to mount a bid for the presidency, particularly following significant regional and provincial victories in February. A candidate from the indigenous Pachakutik party, which functions as the political arm of Conaie, could well be a strong contender. Pachakutik won the most mayoral races of any single party in February, and its presidential candidate came third in 2021, missing out on the second round by just 0.35%.
Political outlook: International relations Promoting international trade and increasing foreign investment will remain a foreign policy priority for Mr Lasso. Having already reduced some important tariffs, the government will seek to sign new free-trade agreements (FTAs) and ease bureaucratic procedures for exporters. Earlier this year Mr Lasso signed an FTA with Costa Rica and concluded negotiations for another one with China; we expect these to be ratified by end-2023. The administration is also actively seeking deals with South Korea, Canada, Panama and Dominican Republic, and has petitioned to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
Relations with the US, which sees Ecuador as an important ally in a region that has ideologically shifted towards the left, will remain strong. However, owing to US politics, which is highly polarised, Mr Lasso has been unable to persuade the administration led by Joe Biden to begin negotiations on an FTA. We consider this to be a long-term goal at best. Simultaneously, Mr Lasso is strengthening ties with China, which last year displaced the US as Ecuador's largest trade partner. In addition to the prospective FTA, Ecuador has endorsed the "One China" principle. We expect that the US will attempt to counter China's growing influence by offering Ecuador economic incentives that fall short of an FTA. In December 2022 the US Senate (the upper house) passed a partnership bill that promotes bilateral trade and investment. US legislators have also introduced a bill that, if enacted, would reduce US tariffs on nearly 50% of Ecuador's exports.

Ecuador's score and placement in EIU's business environment rankings improve only modestly in the 2023-27 forecast period, reflecting the stagnation of the reform agenda of the president, Guillermo Lasso, amid political and social turmoil. Although reforms implemented under Mr Lasso and his predecessor, Lenin Moreno (2017-21), have fostered major improvements in categories such as policy towards private enterprise and competition, and policy towards foreign investment, there has been little progress in other categories such as macroeconomic environment, labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. The strength of the opposition in the unicameral National Assembly limits the scope for reform and explains Ecuador's relatively poor position in the rankings.
The country's highest score is for its macroeconomic environment, reflecting relatively low inflation engendered by dollarisation and an improving fiscal position amid consolidation efforts and higher oil prices in 2023-27 compared with the 2018-22 historical period. Ecuador's fiscal position is now more stable following a 27-month, US$6.5bn extended fund facility (EFF) programme with the IMF that ended in December 2022, marking the first time in two decades that Ecuador had successfully completed a programme with the Fund.
Weak political effectiveness hinders progress on structural reforms Ecuador's weakest score is for political effectiveness. A weak and fragmented party system, an ineffective bureacracy, corruption, and the existence of de facto veto players all hinder the adoption of structural reforms. This is the main reason for the slow pace of progress on Mr Lasso's reform agenda, and for the stagnation in Ecuador's score and ranking. Moreover, weak political effectiveness fuels voter discontent and political instability. There is a risk that this triggers a return to a less business-friendly administration later on in the forecast period.

Ecuador's score for the macroeconomic environment-the strongest area of its business environment-stagnates in the forecast period, causing the country to fall by two places in the global rankings, to 25th, and from first place regionally in the 2018-22 rankings, to third place now. Despite the stagnation in the overall score, there has been movement in the underlying variables-some for better, others for worse-which has, on balance, kept the score unchanged.

- Dollarisation keeps inflation low, reduces the risk of sharp currency volatility and reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. It also contains risks to the fiscal accounts, as deficits must be financed rather than monetised. In an environment of higher oil prices than in 2018-22 and fiscal restraint (necessary to secure new multilateral financing), we believe that the public finances will maintain a small surplus throughout 2023-27. Although public debt has risen in recent years, an improvement in the budget balance will help to ease the public debt burden over the medium term. We think that the risk of de-dollarisation is low, as public support for the measure has been strong since its introduction in 1999.

High oil prices and new mineral exports will keep the current account in surplus
- In December 2022 Ecuador concluded its US$6.5bn 27-month EFF with the IMF (it was the first time in two decades that the country had successfully completed a programme with the Fund). The programme has placed the public finances on more stable footing and increased the independence of the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the central bank), but the Fund has emphasised the need for greater structural reform and fiscal transparency. We believe that the government is likely to seek another agreement for 2023-25, which could unlock up to US$1.1bn in new financing, easing financing concerns and helping to maintain the government's fiscal probity. However, keeping up momentum on structural reforms will be much more difficult going forward.
- Higher oil prices have kept the current account in surplus since 2020, following an average deficit of 0.7% of GDP in 2010-19. We expect this to remain the case, even though a post-pandemic pick-up in private consumption and investment will drive import growth, as oil export prices remain higher than in the historical period, and because mineral exports will support the trade surplus, even as oil prices ease. Current-account surpluses have helped with foreign-reserves accumulation: in January reserves reached US$9.4bn-their highest point since the introduction of dollarisation. We forecast that reserves accumulation will continue, producing average import cover of 3.3 months in the forecast period. Although this is not particularly large, it will help to reduce external vulnerabilities and guard against balance-of-payments risks.

Ecuador's score and rankings for policy towards private enterprise and competition improve significantly in the 2023-27 forecast period; the country jumps 16 places up the global rankings, to 50th, and by five in the regional rankings, to fifth. Despite opposition to public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the legislature, reforms enacted by Mr Lasso and Mr Moreno have improved competition policy, reduced state subsidies and created more space for private enterprises in industries that were once dominated by the state, including mining and oil. However, further liberalisation will be difficult, given opposition from Congress and from civil society (particularly indigenous) groups, particularly to projects in the extractive industries. Nonetheless, the small size of the economy will limit the scope for competition, and monopolies and oligopolies will remain features of Ecuador's business environment, particularly in the energy, cement, financial, supermarket and steel industries. Some improvements in efficiency are likely, but high levels of bureaucracy will constrain private investment and competition in 2023-27.
Price controls for fuels are likely to remain in place
- Price controls for fuels are a point of political contention in Ecuador, and efforts to remove them have been met with large and sometimes destabilising protests. This means that the government must carefully balance fiscal savings (as price liberalisation reduces the need to subsidise firms) with the political cost incurred in rolling subsidies back. Certain goods and services-including fuel, electricity, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals and telephone tariffs-are subject to government price controls, and there are also some limited price controls for some basic foodstuffs. Price controls for fuel have traditionally put substantial strain on the budget (the subsidies that they entail account for about 3% of GDP), but efforts to roll them back have led to huge protests, and we do not expect the Lasso government or its successors to attempt further cuts.

Despite some progress, the competition regulator will remain weak
- The Superintendencia de Control del Poder de Mercado (SCPM, the competition watchdog) has made significant progress in meeting international standards, although Ecuador was one of the last countries in Latin America to introduce a competition law (in 2012). The SPCM has adopted several reforms to improve efficiency and increase co-operation with international competition bodies, including its regional counterparts and the OECD. Ecuador's EFF included provisions to increase market competition and promote liberalisation across economic sectors. For example, the creation of a fast-track review procedure in late 2020 has shortened the approvals process for smaller mergers. However, the government's austerity drive has resulted in SCPM budget cuts every year since 2014, limiting its institutional effectiveness, and despite the body's increased professionalism, it is likely to remain relatively weak in 2023-27. According to the latest available data, for 2021, the SCPM investigated 25 cases of alleged unfair conduct and/or competition; substantiated 20 investigation files on agreements and restrictive practices, and 25 on abuse of market power; and resolved 15 cases of economic concentration. It levied almost US$6m in fines in the same year.
- The Moreno and Lasso administrations have made progress in reducing the state's role in the economy by promoting the use of PPPs and by opening up state companies to private involvement. However, uptake of PPPs has been weak, partly because of shaky investor confidence related to legal insecurity, and partly because of a lack of personnel with the necessary resources to promote and support PPP development. The current PPP legislative framework is based on the Regulations for the Public-Private Partnership Regime, the Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment, and the General Regulations for the Application of the Framework Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment. These were all introduced in 2015-16 and essentially consist of tax breaks-including breaks from import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) during project construction, as well as a ten-year reprieve from income tax and a reprieve from tax on the repatriation of profits. In 2023 the executive will publish new regulations aimed at increasing investment security for PPPs, but they will fall short of the overhaul that a 2022 investment bill (that was rejected by Congress) would have engendered.

Ecuador's score for policy towards foreign investment improves substantially in the 2023-27 period, and the country rises from 72nd to 50th position globally, and from tenth to eighth in the regional rankings. Mr Lasso and Mr Moreno have shown greater willingness to engage with foreign investors in what is a substantial improvement compared with the hostility towards foreign investors that was displayed by another former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17). Broadly speaking, the government's commitment to crafting policy that gives foreign investors transparency, clarity and predictability will be stronger in 2023-27 than in 2018-22. For instance, the Lasso administration's attempts (with limited success) to court private investors to fill gaps in the economy created by fiscal austerity will make for stronger judicial protection for investors, as well as much lower expropriation risk. In view of these developments, policy towards foreign investment will remain one of the stronger aspects of Ecuador's business environment. However, investors are still likely to be apprehensive, given uncertainty over who will succeed Mr Lasso and what the next administration's policies may bring. Powerful domestic vested interests will also continue to resist some of the government's reform efforts.

- Mr Lasso has made it a policy priority to accelerate a trend towards ensuring a more stable foreign investment environment that began under his predecessor. To that end, he brought about Ecuador's return to the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in September 2021, 12 years after Mr Correa withdrew the country. The return signalled a shift in the government's willingness to improve the investment environment. The ICSID has now concluded all of the legal disputes between foreign companies and the Ecuadorean government relating to Mr Correa's tenure; some of the proceedings had dragged on for many years and have only recently been settled. In 2018 legislation came into force that stipulated that disputes over investment agreements be resolved through arbitration. Even international arbitral decisions are now deemed immediately enforceable in Ecuador, without the need for further approval by domestic courts. The aim of this legislation was to allay investors' concerns about judicial security, but concerns about policy reversals under the next government will sustain risks relating to investment protection.

Ecuador's underlying score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves slightly in the forecast period, as does its global ranking, and it climbs by one place in the regional rankings, to eighth. This improvement mainly reflects efforts by the Lasso administration to liberalise trade by adopting tariff reductions. However, the country's openness to trade is still only moderate (relative to its theoretical potential), which explains why Ecuador remains in the bottom half of the rankings. Assuming that Mr Lasso stays in office, trade liberalisation will continue over the forecast period; we do not expect the authorities to implement import or capital-account restrictions.

- Mr Lasso has ramped up negotiations on free-trade agreements (FTAs), including with China, Costa Rica, South Korea, Canada, Panama and the Dominican Republic. We expect legislators to ratify the deal with China by end-2023, which would improve firms' access to Ecuador's largest trade partner. Mr Lasso has also petitioned to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Pacific Alliance (a trade bloc comprising Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico); accession to both is likely within the forecast period.

Relations with the US will continue to improve under Mr Lasso
- Ecuador's trade relationship with the US (its second-biggest export partner) has improved under Mr Lasso, following efforts by the Moreno administration to restore ties that suffered from Mr Correa's decision to withdraw from the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), which granted tariff-free access to the US market for about 6,000 goods. Mr Lasso has been striving to open negotiations into an FTA, but the highly polarised political environment in the US has hindered progress, and we consider an FTA a long-term goal at best. We expect the US to offer partial trade incentives in order to counter Chinese influence in Ecuador, but these could be withdrawn if Mr Lasso's successor is more hostile to the US.

Government will work to stabilise customs framework
- Some progress has been made in recent years in terms of streamlining customs procedures to improve efficiency; for example, the increased use of electronic procedures and automation has sped up the delivery of goods. However, corruption and drug-smuggling via overseas shipments will continue and could well be fuelled by a substantial increase in drug-trafficking operations. Given that tackling corruption is a priority for both the IMF and the US, Ecuador's government is likely to continue trying to crack down on corruption, particularly relating to public procurement processes and trade-related embezzlement. Frequent changes to customs duties have in the past acted as a major disincentive for legitimate businesses and have fuelled contraband trade; the Lasso government and the next one are likely to focus more keenly on stabilising the customs framework in 2023-27.
- The current government has worked to gradually reduce the capital outflows tax, as it deters foreign investment. The tax applies to all non-cash, hard-currency transactions of repatriated capital and transfers from banks to external accounts exceeding US$5,000. Mr Lasso presented a presidential decree in December 2021 that involved reducing the tax by 0.25 percentage points every three months, from 5% at end-2021; it stood at 3.75% as at February 2023. Mr Lasso has expressed an intention to phase out the tax completely, but this will depend on him remaining in office, and on trends in the public finances (the tax is an important source of government revenue).

Ecuador's score for taxes improves in the forecast period, resulting in a notable rise in its global ranking, from 63rd to 48th, and in its regional ranking, from seventh to third. Official tax policy was volatile for part of the historical period and was vulnerable to abrupt changes in legislation aimed at meeting short-term financing needs. However, the situation has improved markedly following the start of the EFF in 2020, and Mr Lasso's November 2021 tax reform spurred further progress by providing incentives for investment (despite a temporary increase in firms' tax rates). Companies making new investments can have their corporate taxes reduced by up to 5 percentage points and are exempt from foreign trade and capital outflows taxes. Although the tax reform will increase fiscal incentives for investment, concerns about regulatory issues and political stability will remain serious deterrents for businesses that are considering committing to long-term projects. There been progress under Mr Moreno and Mr Lasso in simplifying the tax system-in part by digitalising reporting and payment requirements-although it remains complex overall.

- The tax burden on larger companies will ease from 2024. As part of the IMF agreement and Mr Lasso's tax reforms, they will have to pay temporary post-pandemic contributions until end-2023, as a way of bolstering government revenue. The government also introduced an income tax on dividends distributed by resident companies to non-resident businesses or individuals.
- Aside from making changes to tax rates, Mr Lasso has sought to strengthen the tax system, for example by increasing the powers of the Servicio de Rentas Internas (SRI, the tax authority) to combat widespread evasion and abuse of tax avoidance schemes; in May 2022 a reform allowed taxes to be filed electronically and invoices to be digitalised as part of these efforts. Over time the SRI is likely to improve its reputation for efficiency and will also step up its efforts to combat tax evasion.

The government will resist IMF calls to increase the VAT rate
- At 12%, Ecuador's VAT rate is almost 3 percentage points below the regional average. The Fund has recommended increasing the rate, but Mr Lasso will resist this, preferring to raise tax collection by clamping down on evasion and widening the tax base. The government's 2021 tax bill, which increased contributions for some businesses and high-income earners, encountered significant political backlash. If the government's efforts to increase tax inflows through increased collection fail, the Fund could press for increases in tax rates. However, we believe that the government is unlikely to do this willingly, given its precarious political standing. There may be other changes to personal income taxes and consumption taxes (including reductions in personal allowances and deductions) in order to lift the tax take later in the forecast period.

Ecuador's score for financing strengthens considerably in the forecast period, but its rise up the rankings is less pronounced owing to improvements in other similarly ranked countries. State intervention in the banking sector used to be a feature of the business environment but is unlikely to be a particularly big risk in 2023-27. Mr Lasso-a former banker-has engendered greater confidence among commercial banks and their customers, which has spurred deposit and credit growth, albeit from a low level; total credit to the private sector stood at 54% of estimated GDP in 2022, having grown by an average of 13.7% per year in 2021-22. However, numerous long-standing structural issues will complicate corporate access to finance. The banking sector remains underdeveloped relative to the size of the economy, accounting for just 3.6% of GDP in 2022, according to the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the central bank). Financial services are relatively rudimentary, with a small secondary market and two stock exchanges (in Quito, the capital, and Guayaquil) vying for a limited pool of bond and equity issuances. In this context, financing is-and will remain-dominated by bank loans, with only large companies able to secure the lowest rates. The Asociación de Bancos del Ecuador (Asobanca) reported that the average lending rate stood at 9% in January 2023. Smaller companies often face higher interest rates and have loan maturities capped at three years. Long-term bank finance and capital market finance remain underdeveloped and difficult to secure.

- The financial system is weathering the gradual winding-down of pandemic-era support measures and higher financing costs well, and the risk that companies will be unable to service loans or access credit appears to be contained. Financial sounds indicators remain reasonable: provisioning for bad loans stood at 223% in January, and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was at 3.1%, according to Asobanca. Profitability has also has returned to its pre-pandemic level.
- Confidence in the banking system is tied to the management of reserve requirements at the BCE, which is central to sustaining dollarisation but has been the target of regulatory changes in the past. However, recent legislation to strengthen the central bank's authority-in line with Fund reforms-will reduce the risk of more aggressive executive controls on bank deposits (which would weaken commercial bank lending and undermine market confidence more broadly).

Ecuador's underlying score for the labour market improves slightly, but this area is still the weakest area of the business environment in ranking terms; the country improves just two places in the global rankings, to 78th, and it remains in last place regionally in 2023-27. This poor performance reflects a low-quality and relatively high-cost workforce, along with restrictive labour regulation. Mr Lasso's efforts to increase labour flexibility have been put on ice in view of his precarious political standing.
US dollar appreciation will compound competitiveness problems
- Within the formal sector, labour market competitiveness will be hampered by restrictive labour laws and the strength of the US dollar (Ecuador's minimum wage is the highest in Latin America in dollar terms, although the country lags most of its neighbours in terms of productivity). Seeking to bolster popular support, Mr Lasso has continually lifted the minimum wage, which now stands at US$450 per month. The president's difficult political position has forced him to shelve his plans to liberalise restrictive labour in a bid to spur formal job creation, and we do not expect him to revive them in the 2023-27 forecast period.

Raising educational outcomes will be a slow and difficult process
- The country's modest educational outcomes hamper the quality of its workforce. Even assuming that the quality of educational policymaking improves, student results are unlikely to pick up until the end of our 2023-27 forecast period. Skills shortages and mismatches will therefore remain a problem, compounded by a lack of effective training programmes in both the public and private sectors and by the fact that students often leave schooling prematurely so that they can supplement family incomes.

Infrastructure was one of the stronger areas of Ecuador's business environment in the historical period. Although we expect to see some improvements that lift the score in 2023-27, fiscal constraints and investor uncertainty mean that major advances are unlikely. As a result, Ecuador falls by four places in the global rankings, to 65th, although it remains at seventh regionally. The state of infrastructure in Ecuador has benefited from a large public investment programme that Mr Correa put in place and which brought its transport, energy and road infrastructure into line with Latin American standards, following decades of underinvestment (and frequent electricity shortages). Telecoms development (measured by mobile and internet penetration) is also above the regional average. However, the government will be unable to sustain this pace of progress owing to fiscal austerity. Difficulties in attracting private investment for infrastructure projects will also be a limiting factor; Ecuador has a weak track record on fostering successful PPPs, and in 2022 Congress rejected the executive's investment bill, which aimed to fast-track and provide greater investment certainty to PPP contracts. Companies will also be wary of committing to PPPs, given their long timeframes and the risk of speedy policy reversals under future governments.

- A major focus of infrastructure investment has been the development of new hydroelectric power plants to avoid importing costly energy for gas-fired and thermoelectric plants. According to the Operador Nacional de Electricidad (CENACE, the electricity control centre), hydropower now accounts for 92% of the country's energy production. However, there are (valid) concerns that generation from hydroelectric plants will fall short of expected levels, as has been the case with the US$3.2bn Coca Codo Sinclair dam (completed in 2018), owing to design issues and potentially misleading estimates about capacity. The risk is that lower than anticipated production causes supply bottlenecks and raises the need for electricity and fossil fuel imports. Moreover, there is a risk that hydroelectric projects have knock-on effects on the environment, including infrastructure damage caused by erosion or flooding.
- Recently auctioned PPPs have targeted road infrastructure improvements and the creation of new road networks. Mr Lasso's government has set a goal of 40% private participation in the road network by 2025, but we are sceptical about the prospects for success, as most major bids are only due to be held in 2024. Particular priorities are new highways connecting Guayaquil to Quito (the capital), and Guayaquil to Cuenca. The government has also sought private partners to upgrade the port of Esmeraldas and several airport concessions. This should help to boost domestic and regional trade, but it will also create challenges including congestion, as advances in traffic management have been more limited. Moreover, seasonal heavy rains that are costly and difficult to mitigate cause seasonal disruption in some areas. Mass transit systems have been slow to develop; a tram system in Cuenca became operational in 2020, and Quito's metro launched in late 2022, following ten years of construction and several delays.

Ecuador's score for technological readiness improves in 2023-27, but faster progress elsewhere keeps its global ranking unchanged, and it falls to eleventh place regionally, from tenth. This makes technological readiness one of the weakest aspects of Ecuador's business environment; the poor result reflects low smartphone penetration and a lack of spending on research and innovation, which undermine the overall score. These weaknesses are apparent, too, in Ecuador's position of 98th (out of 132 countries) in the 2022 Global Innovation Index developed by the UN World Intellectual Property Organisation-a poor performance for the country's level of development. A low number of patent applications reflects limited overall dynamism in research and development (R&D). On a brighter note, Ecuador scores relatively well for e-commerce preparedness and for cyber-security.
Internet access and penetration will improve over the forecast period
- Despite efforts by the Lasso administration to ease operating conditions for mobile operators by reducing the tax burden on companies and on customer contracts, coverage remains inadequate and costs are high, limiting access. Ecuador has one of the lowest mobile penetration rates in the region, at 94% in 2022, compared with a regional average in excess of 100%. A complicated regulatory environment for foreign companies impedes greater competition in the mobile market. The expansion of 4G technology has been relatively slow, even by regional standards, although subscriptions have been increasing rapidly since the pandemic. Despite the announcement in 2021 of a 5G rollout, we do not expect it to become operational before the end of the forecast period.
- Broadband access is low by regional and global comparison; there were about 2.5m connections in 2021. However, the internet is increasingly accessed via mobile phones, and we expect this means of access to continue to grow as data tariffs become more affordable and mobile phones are used increasingly in place of personal computers (PCs). Rising internet penetration and smartphone usage will foster growth in online retail, albeit from a low base. The Cámara Ecuatoriana de Comercio Electrónico (CECE, the e-commerce chamber) estimates that e-commerce sales increased by 25% in 2022, to US$4bn, from US$646m in 2016.
- E-government has developed relatively slowly; the 2022 iteration of the UN's two-yearly E-Government Survey put Ecuador 84th out of 193 countries for e-government development (down ten positions from 2020), owing to a lower level of online services. The same study ranked Ecuador 41st for e-participation (a separate index that evaluates governments' digital efforts to promote civic engagement), up by eight spots from 2020. There is no single central government information portal, but most major departments have dedicated websites.

Internet banking will continue to rise rapidly, albeit from a low base
- A dramatic rise in internet banking has aided the growth of e-commerce. Digital transactions increased by 161% between 2019 and 2021 (latest available data), to US$135.9bn, according to Asobanca. This is larger than the country's GDP and greater than the volume of transactions in physical banks. Although it is rising rapidly, the number of people who make digital transactions remains low, at just 4.3m, and is skewed heavily in favour of younger users. Growth in digital transactions was driven primarily by the pandemic, when the use of cash and physical transactions was perceived to be more difficult and risky, but it is a trend that we expect to continue.

Economic forecast: Policy trends EIU expects progress on the government's economic reform agenda to slow to a crawl, given that the president, Guillermo Lasso, has been reduced to a lame duck, particularly after voters rejected all of his proposals in a referendum in February. Rather than advancing new economic reforms, we expect the government to focus on protecting its key achievement-fiscal discipline-in order to reduce default risk. In December 2022 Ecuador concluded a US$6.5bn extended fund facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF that was signed in 2020. This marked the first time in two decades that Ecuador had completed an IMF-backed programme-a significant milestone. Although the Fund has commended the government for putting the public finances on a more stable trajectory and for strengthening the independence of the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the central bank), it has emphasised that more action is needed to implement structural reforms and improve fiscal transparency. Given that Ecuador's high risk premium and tight financing conditions will keep it out of international capital markets, we expect the Lasso administration to seek a new agreement with the IMF for 2023-25. Our baseline forecast assumes that the Fund will extend a further US$1.1bn over the next three years as part of a new deal. Under this scenario, we would expect the government to maintain fiscal restraint and adopt additional public financial management reforms, as it did under the recently completed EFF.
Another priority will be to address social unrest, which is being aggravated by higher inflation and crime, and is weighing on Mr Lasso's political standing. To that end, we expect the administration to continue a programme of minimum-wage increments that began in December 2021 with a 6.2% rise-the largest since 2014. A new 5.9% increase came into effect at the start of 2023, and we expect the minimum wage to carry on rising gradually over the rest of Mr Lasso's term. The government may also step up monthly cash transfers to poor families and provide further tax and credit benefits to farmers. There is a risk that social unrest will force Mr Lasso to make more concessions; in this context, balancing voters' demands with the Fund's conditions on fiscal policy will be tricky.
The government's more ambitious market-friendly reforms will be paused, given the hostility of the legislature. This was laid bare in November 2022, when lawmakers sought to abolish Mr Lasso's tax reform (although it was stymied by the Constitutional Court). Moreover, in March of that year Congress rejected an investment-promotion bill that sought to boost public-private partnerships and create free-trade zones. Major reforms that require legislative approval-for example to make the labour market more flexible and modify financial regulations-are now on hold. We therefore expect the Lasso administration to attempt only minimal progress on its agenda via less ambitious (and less politically sensitive) bills. As a case in point, in December the legislature approved an executive bill to increase investment in the audiovisual industry via tax incentives and to cut red tape by digitalising government procedures; the narrow scope of this reform-plus months of negotiations-made its legislative approval possible. The government will also continue to reduce capital outflows tax and to leverage the 2021 tax reform to offer tax incentives to encourage new private investment contracts. Beyond changes to the tax system, efforts to improve the business environment will include pursuing free-trade agreements (FTAs), reducing trade barriers and easing bureaucratic hurdles to doing business. Although these efforts should make the business environment slightly more attractive, we believe that high levels of political instability will offset these improvements.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Government revenue 41.1 36.8 36.5 37.1 36.9 37.1
Government expenditure 41.0 36.9 36.3 36.7 36.4 36.8
Budget balance 0.0 -0.1 0.2 0.4 0.5 0.3
Mr Lasso will remain committed to shoring up the public finances, although political and social spending pressures will curb the pace of fiscal improvement. Even though the referendum defeat and calls by the left-leaning Congress to increase spending have put him in a precarious position, his fiscal consolidation efforts will benefit from a constitution that makes approving new spending measures the prerogative of the executive, rather than the legislature. Mr Lasso's 2021 tax reform raised revenue by increasing contributions for high-income individuals and large firms, and by restricting the scope of tax deductions. However, expenditure is also set to rise given the government's concessions to calm last year's protests. These concessions include increased fuel subsidies and budget rigidities, which encompass mandated increases to the health and education budgets, and automatic pay rises for public officials.
We forecast that the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) account will remain around balance in 2023. Fiscal consolidation efforts will benefit from a second year of high oil prices; although prices will ease later in the forecast period, we expect them to remain above their long-term average, which will relieve some pressure on the public finances but will not preclude the need for spending restraint. Assuming that these factors help to generate overall budget surpluses from 2024, we expect the public debt/GDP ratio to decline from a peak of 63.6% in 2020 to 53.4% in 2027. The recent banking sector stress in the US and Europe, which has caused global market jitters, poses a downside risk-a fall in global growth could trigger a fall in oil demand and hence a collapse in oil prices. Other than that, risks to these assumptions are all political; for example, there is a tangible risk that the next government, which is due to take office in 2025 but could begin earlier given the political turmoil, will not be as fiscally disciplined as the Lasso administration.

As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy and is therefore unable to use certain levers to support growth. In this context, monetary conditions will be determined largely by external factors, particularly by the stance taken by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), which we expect will continue monetary tightening until June and then hold rates steady, before embarking on a mild easing cycle in mid-2024. However, Ecuador's high risk premium and political dysfunction will keep real local rates elevated. Crucially, the BCE will not use international reserves to finance public spending-a policy that would threaten monetary and financial stability, as it would increase the country's liquidity risks and could ultimately jeopardise the dollarisation regime.

We expect the economy to finally return to its pre-pandemic size in 2023, but the pace of growth will decelerate from last year. There will be tailwinds from high global oil prices, but other developments will be less helpful. Still-elevated consumer price inflation and higher interest rates (largely imported from the US) will hit real incomes and cause businesses to halt investment plans. Political instability, aggravated by growing efforts to oust Mr Lasso following his referendum defeat, will also weigh on private investment. Export growth will recover as oil output picks up and shrimp shipments soar, but a challenging global environment will hit overall GDP as the US and European economies decelerate. We expect Ecuador's GDP growth to slow to 1.3% in 2023, from an estimated 2.7% in 2022.
In 2024-27 the economy will struggle to regain momentum, growing by an annual average of 2%. Although real wage growth will accelerate in 2025, it will remain weak, putting a lid on private consumption. Government consumption and investment will not drive growth significantly, given efforts to contain public spending. A combination of strong exports and high demand for the imported materials needed for capital investment will mean that the external account will make just a small (albeit growing) positive contribution to growth in 2024-27.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Oil is Ecuador's most important economic sector, accounting for about 10% of GDP and more than a third of total government revenue. It is also a leading source of investment. The sector has been the main driver behind the huge reduction in the country's long-standing fiscal deficit. Oil-related earnings-(including sales of crude oil and refined fuels such as petrol), boosted by soaring oil prices, particularly since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war-represented 37% of government revenue in 2022 (the highest share since 2013). Given that average global oil prices will be higher in the forecast period than in our 2018-22 historical period, oil sales are likely to continue to support state coffers, but their positive contribution will be lower than in 2022.
Elevated fiscal and export earnings from high oil prices will mask bleaker prospects for production. Mr Lasso's promising reform agenda-he was seeking to double oil output to 1m barrels/day (b/d) by 2025-has mostly stalled. In fact, production has continued its gradual decline since Mr Lasso took office, averaging 470,000 b/d (7% below the 2011-21 average), owing to consistent underinvestment and supply disruptions caused by natural disasters and social unrest. A statist-leaning bureaucracy, judicial setbacks, and environmental and social opposition have hindered the administration's efforts to boost production by attracting private capital. Tenders for oilfields and refineries have progressed slowly and have received a fairly limited response from private operators who, despite high oil prices, remain wary given Ecuador's poor record on contract protection. Development of Ecuador's most promising oil project, the 1.6bn-barrel, heavy crude Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) area, has been held back by environmental concerns and by protests by indigenous groups. Moreover, new explorations have been on hold since the government gave in to protesters' demands for a moratorium on new oil concessions in order to end large-scale protests that broke out in 2022.
Consequently, we now expect production to rise only modestly over the forecast period, to 510,000 b/d by 2027. Given the ongoing moratorium (which could be extended), we expect the government to focus on improving extraction in mature fields and on developing nearby areas. To this end, in October 2022 the administration launched the Intracampos II tender, which aims to attract about US$2bn of private investment in exploration, development and exploitation. Some long-term projects constitute an upside risk to our forecasts. For example, the government plans to tender the operation of the Sacha oilfield, which is one of Ecuador's largest and is currently managed by Petroecuador, the state-owned oil and gas company. Its goal is to increase production by 70%, to 120,000 b/d, via investments of US$4.5bn. This would lift national production by 10%, but we view this as a long-term initiative that will take time to materialise in full. The expansion of ITT, an oilfield with vast reserves that could in principle increase current national output by a third (150,000 b/d), faced a major setback in 2022, when the Constitutional Court effectively blocked the development of key parts of the oilfield on the basis of their proximity to a national park. Amid these issues, as well as social and environmental opposition, we remain sceptical about prospects for substantial increases in oil production. With regard to the downstream business, the Lasso administration has launched a concession to modernise Ecuador's main refinery, Esmeraldas, which would boost efficiency and reduce demand for imported fuel derivatives.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Consumer prices (av) 3.5 2.0 1.9 1.2 0.5 1.3
Real wages 2.7 0.7 0.8 1.5 1.9 1.3
We forecast that 12-month consumer price inflation will slow from an estimated 3.7% in December 2022 to 1.1% by the end of this year. Supply-side pressures that accumulated during 2022 are easing as global demand cools and supply chains are repaired. However, international commodity markets will remain especially sensitive to one-off climate-related shocks in major producers, which could include drought, flooding and natural disasters, the effects of which could pass through to the domestic economy quickly. We expect global commodity prices to continue to ease and dollarisation to remain in place. In view of these factors, we expect inflation to moderate to an average of 1.2% per year in 2024-27.

We expect dollarisation to be maintained in 2023-27. De-dollarisation remains highly unlikely, given strong support for the exchange-rate regime on the basis that it promotes macroeconomic stability. We expect the Lasso government to remain committed to restoring the public finances, accumulating reserves and working to strengthen the BCE's independence. Multilateral and bilateral financing, notably from the IMF and China, will help to assuage concerns about financing and liquidity amid limited access to international capital markets.

Assuming that IMF financial support continues, we are cautiously optimistic about the external accounts in 2023-27 and expect a series of small current-account surpluses. Export growth, high oil prices and a slowdown in import growth should all support the trade balance in 2023, contributing to an overall current-account surplus of 1.3% of GDP. Thereafter, mining exports will gain momentum, helping to maintain a trade surplus, even though revenue from oil exports will fall as global prices ease. Current-account surpluses and multilateral financing will bolster the BCE's foreign-exchange reserves, providing a cushion against fiscal and financial shocks. We expect reserves to rise to 3.4 months of import cover by end-2027, from an average of 1.8 months in 2010-20. Although Mr Lasso wants to increase private investment, strong legislative opposition and social instability will weigh on these efforts; foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will remain weak in 2023-27, averaging just 0.6% of GDP, and will be concentrated in extractive industries. The outlook for FDI could improve if Mr Lasso makes more progress on his policy agenda than we currently expect.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Ecuador Stocks and flows Ecuador has historically attracted little foreign direct investment (FDI). Annual inflows averaged of US$774m (0.8% of GDP) in 2011-17, during the presidency of Rafael Correa (2007-17), although his policies caused investor confidence to weaken. FDI inflows rose at the margin under Lenín Moreno (2017-21), reflecting a more conciliatory approach to the private sector, but they remained low, averaging just US$947m (0.9% of GDP) per year. EIU estimates that inflows averaged 0.6% of GDP per year in 2021-22, probably reflecting investor wariness, despite the market-friendly stance of the current administration, led by Guillermo Lasso. We estimate the total stock of inward FDI at US$22bn in 2022. This is one of the smallest stocks among major Latin American economies, equating to 20.2% of GDP.
Origin and distribution Sources of FDI to Ecuador have changed significantly in recent years. As total FDI figures are low, a single major investment has a huge influence on the overall make-up of FDI at any one time. For example, Canada was the biggest investor in 2018-21, owing to the development of Fruta del Norte (Ecuador's first large-scale gold mine) by a Canadian firm. US firms used to be Ecuador's main source of FDI but disinvested in the country in 2008-10 amid uncertainty over oil contract renegotiations and the global financial crisis. FDI levels from the US have never fully recovered and have since stabilised at a lower level than previously, accounting for of about 7% of inflows in 2018-22. Chinese FDI rose rapidly in 2011-21 as bilateral trade and diplomatic ties strengthened, but inflows moderated to an average of 6% in 2018-22. The extractive sectors attract most of the inflows; almost half of FDI in 2017-21 went to mining and hydrocarbons. The manufacturing, agri- and aqua-culture, and retail sectors also attract foreign investment.
Determinants Historically, FDI into Ecuador has been primarily resource-seeking, given the country's natural resource endowment, particularly in the hydrocarbons industry. However, policy uncertainty, weak institutions and an unreliable business environment have constrained investment. On top of this, the small domestic market, a relatively high cost of labour and low income levels still deter market-seeking or efficiency-seeking investments. The Lasso administration has stepped up efforts to attract private foreign investment by providing tax incentives and increasing legal certainty. This trend started under Mr Moreno, whose government focused on promoting investment in the extractive sectors and eliminating a 70% "windfall tax" on profits in mining. However, this has not yet translated into a major increase in inflows of FDI.
Impact The impact of inward FDI on productivity and export competitiveness has been limited because most investment has been directed towards capital-intensive natural resource sectors, which have weak links to the rest of the economy. However, FDI has helped to boost export earnings in the energy sector and to create indirect employment. Although technology transfer has been limited, oil revenue has supported the country's balance-of-payments position.
Potential The country's strong endowments of natural resources will be attractive to foreign investors, and FDI will continue to be concentrated in this area, although recent free-trade agreements (FTAs) could prompt some modest diversification. A more pragmatic approach to attracting private foreign capital and a shift away from the unorthodox policies of Mr Correa's government have increased the country's macroeconomic stability, and new FTAs (particularly one with China) will create another incentive to invest. However, policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficiencies and low labour productivity will continue to pose challenges. Political instability and social opposition to the extractive sectors (predominantly from powerful indigenous groups) constitute the biggest obstacles to attracting FDI, as investors will remain wary of policy shifts that undo recent improvements in the business environment. Powerful domestic interest groups will hinder efforts to open up investment opportunities in the oil sector. Sluggishness in consumption and relatively slow growth will also deter investment. On that basis, we expect FDI inflows to remain stable in the 2023-27 forecast period, at an annual average of 0.6% of GDP.

Population growth is slowing but is still high relative to developed countries Population growth has been slowing for decades, and EIU expects this trend to continue in the 2023-27 forecast period, owing to a falling birth rate and continued-albeit lower-emigration. We expect the population to grow by an annual average of 1% per year, which is similar to the regional average but high compared with developed-country standards. The population reached an estimated 18m in 2022 and should rise to 18.9m by 2027.
A falling birth rate is acting as a brake on population growth, which we expect to come in at an annual average rate of 1% in 2023-27-similar to the regional average. Labour force growth will still outstrip population growth, sustaining a demographic dividend throughout the forecast period. However, this trend will fade in the next decade, complicating prospects for Ecuador's convergence with more developed economies in the region.
At about 65% Ecuador has a lower urbanisaton rate than its regional peers, although it has fallen from the rate of 55% recorded in 1990. We expect this percentage to rise only slightly by 2027. Almost half of city dwellers reside either in the capital, Quito, or in the largest city and main business centre, Guayaquil. Urbanisation over the past 50 years has increased the level of informality, as the creation of full-time jobs has risen much more slowly.
Unemployment stood at 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022-similar to the same period of 2019. Although this points to a recovery from the covid-19 shock, the quality of jobs has deteriorated, and the rate of adequate employment is still below pre-pandemic standards. We expect the labour force to continue to expand faster than the overall population during the forecast period. Efforts by the current president, Guillermo Lasso, to boost formal job creation by liberalising the labour market have lost steam owing to strong political opposition. As a result, the formal economy will struggle to absorb new entrants, and informal employment, which the government estimated at 54.3% of the labour force as at February 2023, is likely to stay high. The large size of the informal sector constrains productivity and consumer purchasing power, as well as the government's revenue-raising (and public investment) capacity.
Government will struggle to integrate Venezuelan migrants The Lasso government's efforts to step up the regularisation of Venezuelan migrants should increase the size of the labour force marginally, although it will also increase competition for low-skilled jobs, putting downward pressure on job quality and wages, particularly for young Ecuadoreans who have only primary education. Ecuador has taken in more than 450,000 migrants from Venezuela, and successive governments have struggled to integrate them into the formal job market, especially given the economic shock from the pandemic. The country's slow economic recovery may well deter Venezuelan migration in the 2023-27 forecast period, as Venezuelans will be more attracted to stronger neighbouring economies.
Progress in improving healthcare and education standards will be slow The vulnerable state of the public finances will hinder improvements in education and healthcare. Strong oil revenue during the 2000s commodity boom helped to reduce poverty levels and improve social indicators following decades of underinvestment. However, even though education and healthcare now account for a much larger share of public spending than they did in the past, standards are still fairly low. For example, the government has only partly reversed a long-standing medicine shortage in hospitals. Moreover, according to (latest available) World Bank data from 2018, 61% of ten-year-olds were unable to read and understand a simple text-a slightly worse result than for Ecuador's regional peers (59%) but significantly better than other upper-middle-income countries (40%). Regular labour conflicts with public healthcare and education workers-often resulting in industrial action-have hampered efforts to improve service quality. The 2008 constitution promised free universal healthcare and education, but the government will struggle to deliver on this, given its straitened fiscal circumstances and the large informal economy. Improvements in education and healthcare will be only gradual in 2023-27, with progress crippled by narrow scope for raising spending.

Ecuador is one of the smaller markets in EIU's business environment rankings, accounting for about 0.1% of global GDP and a similar share of global exports. It is in theory attractive as a location for resource-seeking investment, given its large endowment of natural resources, and we do expect the country's oil and mineral reserves to continue to attract interest from foreign investors. Although market-friendly reforms enacted by the current administration, led by Guillermo Lasso, have improved the business environment and made the country more attractive to investors, concerns about long-term policy predictability-particularly a return to the left-wing policies implemented by a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17)-and difficulties inherent in making material improvements to the business environment are likely to preclude a sharp increase in investment in natural resources.
Ecuador's market will expand, but only modestly Ecuador's attractiveness as a location for market-seeking investment is constrained by low incomes, high poverty rates, high income inequality and a large informal economy. Boosted by a rising population but hindered by slow economic growth, GDP per head will expand modestly in the forecast period, to US$14,963 in 2027, which is just two-thirds of the Latin American average. Moreover, Ecuador's per-head income figures will disguise wide inequalities: we expect reductions in income inequality to be marginal at best in 2023-27. Households appear to have suffered long-lasting damage from the covid-19 shock, as the rate of adequate employment is still more than 3 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. Similarly, although the poverty rate is in line with its pre-pandemic level, at 25.2%, it is still significantly above the 21.5% recorded in December 2017. These factors will constrain overall market growth throughout the forecast period. On a more positive note, changes in consumer behavior-namely higher demand for modern retail shopping-will create attractive market opportunities for businesses. Moreover, low growth in per-head income has increased dynamism in the the low-cost segment, such as discount stores.
Ecuador is not a major destination of efficiency-seeking investment. As a result of dollarisation and successive years of guaranteeing a "living wage" (essentially a minimum wage), Ecuador is no longer a cheap-labour investment location. In US dollar terms, the country has one of the highest minimum wages in Latin America. Also weighing on the country's competitiveness are low skills levels. On a brighter note, dollarisation provides investors with greater overall macroeconomic stability, particularly by reducing inflation and exchange-rate risks. We assume that investment in most areas outside the oil sector will be slow to arrive, as improvements in the business environment will be only incremental and are at risk of reversal, given political turmoil. Moreover, we do not expect significant progress on improving the transparency and efficiency of the judicial system. A positive outlier is the booming shrimp export industry, where Ecuador has gained technical sophistication and is becoming a global leader. We expect this sector to continue to attract investment as demand from Asia and new free-trade agreements (FTAs) increase export opportunities.

Business opportunities will be limited by low levels of development Although inflation has started to ease from its 2022 levels, real disposable incomes will rise only gradually amid sluggish growth, meaning that the shift in consumer attitudes towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets will continue. Over the medium to long term, we expect purchasing power to pick up as labour market conditions improve. Rising incomes will mean that a smaller proportion of real disposable income is spent on food and housing, and that consumer durables and other high-ticket items account for a larger share of spending. The proportion of income spent on leisure and education, hotels and restaurants, and other high-end goods will remain low. However, Ecuador's market will remain relatively small, hindered by slow economic development.

Low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources give Ecuador scope to catch up with more developed countries, provided that policies are implemented to transform its resource wealth into productive investment in other sectors. Although EIU expects Ecuador to benefit from dollarisation and incremental improvements to the business environment, poor prospects for significant improvements to institutions bode ill for stability in the direction of economic policy. Assuming that structural deficiencies, governability obstacles and inconsistent policymaking endure, long-term investment is likely to be lacking and income levels will continue to trail developed-country levels. On this basis, EIU expects Ecuador's per-head GDP to be only 17% of that of the US (in purchasing power parity terms) in 2050-unchanged from 2022.
Initial conditions: Ecuador's GDP per head is one of the lowest in South America, at an estimated US$6,069, which equates to US$12,766 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. For comparison, Ecuador's per-head GDP is less than a tenth of the US figure (and less than a fifth at PPP). A series of boom-bust cycles has prevented sustained growth; GDP grew at an average of 3% per year between 1990 and 2019 (a modest pace, given Ecuador's stage of development). Political instability, weak institutions and high levels of poverty and inequality-combined with an overdependence on oil-have led to a rent-seeking and unproductive economy that is plagued by low education levels and productivity, and by high labour informality. Ecuador's human capital and infrastructure standards significantly lag those in developed economies.
Although dollarisation, which was adopted in 2000, has shielded the public finances from both inflation and devaluation risk, it has also made Ecuador less competitive and has not prevented fiscal mismanagement, as occurred during the government of Rafael Correa (2007-17). The large fiscal deficit has narrowed significantly since 2020, owing to consolidation efforts and high oil prices. Moreover, full dollarisation means that Ecuador has no monetary independence and has lost the ability to use policy interest rates or currency devaluation as macroeconomic policy levers.
Demographic trends: Population growth is set to fall gradually over the long term, from an average of 1% in 2023-30, to 0.7% in 2031-50. The main driver of this trend will be lower fertility, in addition to some net migration. Ecuador's demographic dividend will be over by the end of the decade, as the working-age population will no longer be growing faster than the overall population. Still, both demographic groups will grow at similar levels through 2040, keeping the dependency ratio low. The main challenge facing the country will be to create enough formal jobs for entrants to the labour market, so as to reduce informality. There has been some progress in expanding education to improve labour quality, but the lack of dynamism in the private sector means that there is a substantial risk of labour informality remaining high in the long term, particularly as the covid-19 pandemic appears to have done lasting damage to the labour market. Efforts will also be required to address the pension needs of an ageing population, which could increase strains on the country's already-vulnerable social security system.
External conditions: As a small, open economy, Ecuador has benefited from rising global trade, although it remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. This causes significant external and fiscal volatility, as demonstrated by frequent booms and busts depending on prices of oil (the country's biggest export). Inconsistent trade policies and the country's geographical distance from its biggest trade partners (particularly the US and the EU) have dampened possibilities for stronger integration with industrialised nations. Recently negotiated free-trade agreements (FTAs), particularly with China, will bolster trade and diversify the export basket, but oil will remain the dominant source of receipts. There is scope for increased trade integration with neighbouring countries, but a lack of supply-chain strategies and infrastructure constraints will hinder progress. There has been some success in export diversification towards the Middle East, Russia and Asia, but Ecuador's small and distant market will weigh on its competitiveness profile, particularly compared with Asian emerging markets. As the economy is likely to remain heavily reliant on hydrocarbons and some mineral and agricultural products, the health of the external sector and GDP growth will hinge on the direction of terms of trade.
Future governments will struggle with a weak institutional framework Institutions and policy trends: Ecuador's institutions have long suffered from periods of instability. Military coups, protests and opposition from the legislature have forced three presidents from office, and the incumbent, Guillermo Lasso, is at risk of suffering a similar fate. Inconsistency in conceiving and implementing new legislation remains a major problem. Successive governments have changed the policy direction. Although power is concentrated in the executive, a highly fragmented political and social landscape complicates governability. We expect these deficiencies to remain over the long term, as a weak and personalistic party system will complicate governments' efforts to adopt structural institutional reforms. Regardless of their ideological inclination, administrations will continue to struggle with a weak legal framework, corruption and distorted policy priorities that either favour special interest groups or undermine the public finances.
Long-term performance: Unattractive investment conditions and the lack of a competitive, skilled labour force will make Ecuador a relatively unappealing destination for foreign investment in labour-intensive or manufacturing activities. However, sustained improvements in education levels, added to productive investment in non-oil sectors and technology transfer, could make Ecuador more competitive and boost long-term growth. For this to occur, the country would need to strengthen its institutional framework and improve its business environment. Our forecast suggests that progress on introducing structural reforms will be slow and insufficient for Ecuador to make progress on catching up (income-wise) with OECD countries in the long term. In 2050, at the end of our long-term forecast period, we expect Ecuador's GDP per head at PPP to be just 15% of the US level.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Ecuador suffers from natural disaster risk via its exposure to multiple hazards, especially earthquakes, floods, volcanic activity and landslides; climate change is likely to exacerbate the frequency and magnitude of some of these events. In 2016 a 7.8-magnitude earthquake-the worst since 1979-caused US$3.3bn in damage and exacerbated fiscal strains stemming from low oil prices. Although disaster resilience has improved following the earthquake, climate change preparedness is lacking. Ecuador's geographical location and diversity render it particularly vulnerable: according to the UN's 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would increase the population affected by floods in Ecuador by 300%. The country's consistent temperature year-round has hindered the development of glaciers, as they are not able to replenish lost density during colder seasons. Indeed, there has been a significant reduction in the size of Ecuador's glaciers in the two main mountain ranges-the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Occidental-which in aggregate have been reduced by about a third over the past 50 years. By 2050 this trajectory will jeopardise the water sources for the country's major urban centres, including the capital, Quito. Rising temperatures will also affect agricultural production, as warmer winters will cause crops to sprout prematurely, and greater volatility in precipitation rates will disrupt production. Moreover, climate change could intensify weather effects relating to the El Niño phenomenon, which tends to bring higher temperatures and heavy rainfall that affect crops and fisheries.
Ecuador's dependence on the oil industry will accentuate energy transition risks in the medium to long term. Moving away from oil would have serious negative implications for growth prospects and would remove the state's biggest source of revenue (oil accounts for about a third of the total). On that basis, EIU expects a very slow transition away from oil as demand for the fuel declines gradually. In terms of electricity generation, hydroelectric power accounts for about 90%. Although this high share keeps emissions down, hydroelectric infrastructure can suffer from climate-related damage; for example, soil erosion can force costly repairs. We expect the government to promote the transition towards other renewable sources in the long term, which will diversify the energy mix and should present business opportunities.
Migration and urbanisation Urbanisation in Ecuador is a relatively recent phenomenon and comparatively low for Latin America. The majority of the population has traditionally lived in rural communities in the mountainous sierra region. Since crossing the 50% threshold in 1990, the proportion of people living in cities has grown slowly, from about 62% in 2006 to 65% in 2022. The establishment of a middle class under a social spending and consumption-driven economic policy in the 2000s, particularly under a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), will sustain an increasing urban population. Meanwhile, security concerns in the north and environmental degradation in the sierra are likely to accelerate the pace of migration from rural areas to cities over the medium term. The country's infrastructure and natural resources will come under greater strain in that process, necessitating greater investment. There will be opportunities for public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure investment, but internal migration will also invite limited bouts of social unrest.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - EIU expects the president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi) to step down in February 2024, when his constitutionally stipulated final term ends. Given the high approval ratings enjoyed by Jokowi and his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), the party is well placed to retain its position as the largest party in parliament while its endorsed candidate is likely to secure the presidency. The next administration will maintain Jokowi's "big tent" approach to governance, ensuring policy continuity and political stability. Indonesia will further foster its ties with Association of South-East Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. Ties with China will remain cordial but cautious.

- We expect Indonesia's business environment to improve in 2023-27 and this will lead to its global ranking improving. However, quicker improvements in the region mean that its regional rank will fall by one place to 14th. There will be significant progress in the taxes, infrastructure and labour market categories. The Government Regulation in Lieu of Law on Job Creation (known as the Job Creation Perppu) will lead to an improvement to the business environment on various fronts. However, legal uncertainty, corruption and bureaucracy will weigh on the overall score.

- We forecast that Indonesia's economy will grow by an annual average of 5.2% in 2023-27; this is largely on a par with rates of growth before the pandemic. The government will continue to focus on improving the business environment to boost investment (domestic and foreign), particularly in infrastructure development. Investment into the mineral and extractive sectors will stay robust, despite the high interest-rate environment. Private consumption will remain the primary driver of GDP growth in 2023-27, expanding by an average of 5.2% per year. The growth of merchandise exports (particularly for commodities) in 2023 will be slower than that of 2022 but will be sufficient to keep the goods trade account in the black. The country's current account will remain in surplus in 2023-24, but will return to deficit from 2025 as domestic demand and, specifically, capital imports rise.

- With a population of 272m in 2022, Indonesia is home to close to 40% of the population in ASEAN. We forecast that population growth will continue to decelerate in 2023-27. The working-age population will grow at a slightly faster rate than the overall population, but will decelerate owing to falling birth rates. There are considerable differences in growth rates and density among Indonesia's various provinces.

- Indonesia's consumer market is one of the largest in South-east Asia, with a favourable demographic profile for consumer-oriented sectors in the medium to long term. GDP per head will remain modest, however, ensuring that demand will be greatest for lower-cost goods. Personal disposable income will grow substantially over 2023-27. The proportion of income spent on food is likely to fall, with a bigger proportion spent on clothing, footwear, transport and communication, among other discretionary purchases. A growing urban high-net-worth population in cities means that there will also be an expanding market for high-end consumer goods.

- Indonesia will maintain a healthy economic expansion during the long-term forecast period. The average age of the population will increase slowly, which will temper growth momentum towards 2050. Steady progress in improving the business environment, notably in easing regulations, will boost investment and increase productivity. As the largest economy in ASEAN, Indonesia will become an important player on the global stage and is likely to play a leading role in the functioning of ASEAN.

a Actual.
Background: Republican forces led by Sukarno (Indonesia's first president) declared independence from the Netherlands in 1945. Sukarno was ousted in a coup led by General Suharto in 1967, following a near-collapse of the economy. Suharto presided over three decades of authoritarian government before being forced to resign in 1998 amid an economic and social crisis. Indonesia then experienced far-reaching political reform, known as the reformasi period, which ushered in more democratic government, including direct presidential elections. In 2014 Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi) became Indonesia's seventh president. Jokowi is the first president to come from outside the traditional political establishment.
Political structure: In 2004 the president and vice-president were elected directly for the first time. Since then, the directly elected People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) comprises the 575-member House of People's Representatives (DPR, the legislature) and the 136-member Regional Representatives' Council (DPD). Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, the role of the DPR has been expanded and its power increased. Presidential and legislative elections were held concurrently since 2019.
Policy issues: In the short term, the government will focus on encouraging investment, primarily to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This will be spearheaded by the Government Regulation in Lieu of Law on Job Creation (known as Job Creation Perppu), which has been in effect since end-2022. Its ratification by parliament in March 2023 will ensure its legal certainty. The authorities will seek to improve standards of governance and reduce corruption. The administration has also moved to remove barriers impeding foreign investment, including the dominance of state-owned enterprises in some industries, but economic nationalism overshadows policymaking.
Taxation: Marginal tax rates range from 5% to 35%. An 11% VAT is levied on most goods and services, and will rise to 12% in 2025. A special sales tax of 10-12.5% is imposed on most luxury items. The corporate tax rate is 22%.
Foreign trade: Data from Statistics Indonesia show that merchandise imports totalled US$229.9bn in 2022, up from US$189bn in 2021, while goods exports surged to US$292.5bn, from US$232.8bn in 2021. This yielded a substantial merchandise trade surplus of US$62.7bn, up from US$43.8bn in 2021.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Indonesia is a presidential democracy with a 575-seat legislature, the House of People's Representatives (DPR). The president, who is the head of government as well as head of state, is allowed to serve up to two terms in office. The current president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), took office in October 2014 and will serve his second and final term, until the next election in February 2024. He governs with the backing of seven parties (out of nine in the DPR), which currently hold 471 out of 575 parliamentary seats. Jokowi's most significant backers are the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P) and Golkar, Indonesia's oldest political party.

The PDI-P-led coalition will dominate parliament even after the next election
Two major Islamic parties, the National Awakening Party (PKB) and National Mandate Party (PAN), are in Jokowi's coalition, ensuring support from Indonesia's conservative, right-leaning bodies. Indonesia's third-largest party, the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), fielded its head, Prabowo Subianto, as a rival to Jokowi in the 2019 election. However, after his defeat, Mr Subianto joined Jokowi's cabinet as defence minister, with Gerindra joining the governing coalition. Against this broad coalition, the opposition parties-the Democratic Party (PD) and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS)-will have only weak influence.

EIU expects Jokowi, who has a good track record of consensus building, to enjoy reasonably strong support from parliament during his remaining term in office. However, some component parties within the ruling Onward Indonesia Coalition (KIM) will endorse their preferred candidate for the upcoming presidential election, which may differ from the candidate preferred by the dominant Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P). This will strain relations within the KIM. Periodic cabinet reshuffles to strengthen political consolidation of power have been a mainstay in Jokowi's tenure; he has reshuffled his cabinet seven times over his nine-year tenure. Further reshuffles are highly likely ahead of the next election in 2024, amid fraying ties between the PDI-P and its allies within the coalition. However, these parties will remain in the coalition until its dissolution before the next election.

Political outlook: Political stability The president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), will maintain stability within government during his second and final term (which ends in mid-2024) through a broad parliamentary coalition and cabinet. His cabinet includes members of various parties, including former military personnel and religious leaders.
With this "big tent" approach, Jokowi has neutralised prominent critics in the opposition and managed to push through controversial policies. One drawback has been occasional policy missteps and reversals made to shore up internal support, but these have not swayed his public support enough to endanger his remaining time in office. The president's popularity among the electorate has remained resilient throughout the current period of high consumer price inflation and slowing economic growth.
Jokowi's perennial popularity owes much to the image that he has cultivated of a pragmatic leader from a humble background; this contrasts with elite figures who often hail from political dynasties. EIU expects his successor to maintain the big tent strategy, which will probably involve the losing candidates being included in the new administration. This will help to maintain political stability within the government, although these tactics will constrain the efficiency of policymaking. The Constitutional Court's decision in November 2022 to allow ministers to remain in office after declaring themselves as presidential nominees raises the risk of more instances of legislative deadlock ahead of the next general election, in February 2024.
Jokowi's anti-corruption drive will claim more high-level officials and prove popular with the public. Graft is rife in Indonesia, and the lack of robust institutional mechanisms to combat malpractice means that it will remain a risk to political stability in 2023-27. Major scandals, including those within the KPK, and rising concerns about corruption further undermine already low public trust in law enforcement agencies and the KPK. Nonetheless, we expect the next administration to ensure the continuity of the KPK.
Despite the passage of legislation to partition West Papua province into three new provinces in mid-2022, instability will persist in that region amid regular cycles of unrest followed by crackdowns. However, without major external economic or political support, separatist movements will be unable to mount a threat to Indonesia's sovereignty. Strict limits on access by international observers will remain the norm. The government's approach will combine tough near-term political and military tactics with a focus on long-term economic development. This approach will not reduce violence in 2023-27.
Easing consumer price inflation and stable economic growth will limit the likelihood of protests in 2023-24. A possible impetus could be the Government Regulation in Lieu of Law on Job Creation (also known as the Job Creation Perppu), which was ratified by parliament in March 2023. This replaces the Omnibus Law on Job Creation that was ruled unconstitutional in 2021, which was subjected to heavy criticism from student and labour unions. Changes included in the new law were relatively minor. Although the new law has been in effect since December 30th 2022, critics are likely to demand for more public consultations on it, as well as for it to be retracted. However, we do not expect the government accede to any of these demands.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The country will make slow progress on political reforms in 2023-27. In 2014 the Constitutional Court ruled that the 2019 legislative and presidential elections must be held on the same day, which would increase the likelihood of the DPR being politically aligned with the presidency, reducing horse-trading between parties on the outcome of the presidential poll. However, the ruling did not remove the requirement that presidential candidates may be nominated only by parties or coalitions of parties. This means that presidential contenders will need to make compromises on their policy agendas either with the main political parties or a group of smaller parties. This might lead to narrow and populist influences on policymaking.
Improving the efficiency of the bureaucracy will remain a priority Corruption remains rife and extends to most levels of government and throughout the judiciary. Pervasive graft means that the legal system is unpredictable and frequently prioritises local interests. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) enjoys significant public support. However, its independence and power has been weakened; the KPK is now a regular civil service body regulated by an oversight board from the government. Some prominent investigators were disqualified from the organisation in the process. Although the KPK still demonstrates its commitment and capacity to prosecute senior officials (in early 2023 the incumbent governor of Papua was arrested on graft charges), its room for operation is curtailed by political factors. The KPK is likely to continue investigating senior officials without fear or favour, but its action will be subjected to more political pressure.
Appointments to public-sector posts are not always based on merit. At lower levels, cronyism and nepotism remains a significant problem, resulting in a lack of competence among many public officials. At higher levels, favouritism to keep the support of coalition partners is also a problem. Political dynasties remain deeply embedded within regional- and national-level governance structures; for instance, Jokowi's son and son-in-law occupied regional-level positions in 2021. Skill shortages in the civil service are also likely to remain a problem throughout 2023-27.
Political outlook: Election watch The next parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled to be held concurrently on 14th February 2024. We expect the centre-left Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), which holds 128 seats in the 575-seat House of People's Representatives (DPR, the legislature), to maintain its position as the largest single party in the chamber. Public surveys give the PDI-P a consistent lead over its nearest rivals, Golkar (currently holding 85 seats) and the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra; 78), both of which are more right wing. An anticipated easing of consumer price inflation and accelerating economic growth from mid-2023 will augur well for the prospects of the incumbent PDI-P and its endorsed presidential candidate. Strong patronage networks in Indonesia prevent large swings in party support, although presidential voting preference is less partisan.
Presidential nominations will not be finalised until mid-2023, but we believe that the election will be won by Ganjar Pranowo (the governor of Central Java). Although the PDI-P, the party that Mr Pranowo belongs to, has yet to endorse a candidate, we expect it ultimately to support Mr Pranowo. This will reflect his popularity and status as a non-establishment candidate. Furthermore, Jokowi has also hinted his preference for Mr Pranowo as the party's presidential nominee, lending credence to his bid.
Two other candidates who have announced their bid for the presidency are Anies Baswedan (the former governor of Jakarta) and Prabowo Subianto (the incumbent defence minister and a previous presidential contender). Mr Baswedan is endorsed by the National Democratic Party (NasDem), while Mr Subianto is endorsed by Gerindra. In March the Central Jakarta court ordered the General Elections Commission to halt preparations for two years, following a lawsuit filed by a newly formed party. We expect the commission's appeal to overturn the decision to be successful.
Political outlook: International relations Indonesia will continue to strive for an omnidirectional foreign policy in 2023-27, aiming for no significant alignment towards one specific country or bloc at the expense of another. Nonetheless, there will be minor frictions stemming from territorial tensions between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China.
Although Indonesia's insistence on neutrality-as seen recently in its dealings with Russia and Ukraine-will slow the development of relations with many Western countries, it will also offer benefits, including sustained investment and trade flows with its partners (particularly China and Russia). China is Indonesia's largest trade partner and a major investor in infrastructure, manufacturing and mining. Indonesia's reluctance to confront China directly over its persecution of its Muslim minorities will allow bilateral economic ties to remain close. However, Indonesia's ongoing development of a gasfield in an area of its maritime territory that is claimed by China will be a source of friction between the two countries. Another flashpoint that could escalate tensions is the planned code of conduct in the South China Sea, which is intended to prevent potential conflict and accidental incursions in the disputed area. Indonesia-as the chair for the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2023-has made the code of conduct a priority in its policy agenda.
The government's attempt to portray Indonesia as a moderate Muslim country will be undermined by a new criminal code (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana, or KUHP) that raises the risk of political suppression. The code replaces an antecedent that was carried over from the colonial period. Coming into full effect in late 2025, the new code includes prohibitions on insulting the government, holding unauthorised demonstrations and disseminating fake news, which will be a cause for concern among international organisations and Western governments.

Indonesia's score in the EIU's business environment ranking is set to improve from 5.39 in 2018-22 to 5.96 in 2023-27. Consequently, its global position rises by two places, from 60th to 58th, but improvements in Indonesia's neighbours mean its regional ranking falls from 13th to 14th out of 17 economies. The increase in the overall score is driven by improvements in the scores for the political environment, policy towards private enterprise & competition, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. However, the scores for the macroeconomic environment category will deteriorate.
The country's large and growing consumer market ensures that it scores highly in the market opportunities category. This is complemented by its vast reserves of strategic commodities including nickel and bauxite. Indonesia's ratification of the Regional Comprehensive Economist Partnership (RCEP) in early 2023 and its membership in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) will deepen regional integration and market access for its commodities exports. The score for macroeconomic environment, nevertheless, deteriorates in 2023-27 as the authorities grapple with significant volatility in the value of its currency and elevated inflation in the early part of the forecast period
Jokowi's "big tent" approach will be a mainstay in Indonesian politics The Ministry of Finance will continue to reform and simplify the tax burden, and retrieve unpaid revenue in 2023-27. The government will also introduce tax holidays to incentivise foreign and domestic investments into the new capital city and select industries in other provinces. These measures underpin Indonesia's improvement in the scores for taxes and policy towards foreign investment. Indonesia's score in the political environment category is expected to improve in the forecast period. The "big tent" approach adopted by the incumbent president is likely to be a mainstay in Indonesian politics, even after he steps down at the end of his term in February 2024.

Indonesia's score for macroeconomic environment slips from 7.2 in 2018-22 to 6.6 in 2023-27. The economy is forecast to expand at an annual average rate of 4.7% in 2023, which is lower than the annual average growth rate in the decade before the pandemic, and consumer price inflation will remain elevated in 2023. The economy has twin deficits on its fiscal and external accounts, which are likely to become more expensive to finance as global interest stays close to cyclical highs. The currency, the rupiah, is perpetually at risk of depreciation depending on foreign investor sentiment. The policymaking process is likely to be under the pressure of compromises, given the multiple coalitions that Jokowi has to take into consideration. There is also a sizeable risk that Jokowi's successor will have a more economically nationalistic outlook and either undoes or discontinues the efforts made by Jokowi's administration to make the economy more competitive.
Fiscal discipline will help to bolster the government's credibility
- Throughout the forecast period the government will maintain a focus on restoring discipline to the fiscal account, following a period of higher spending to combat the pandemic. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which wrecked Indonesia's economy, successive governments have run tight fiscal policies to demonstrate to international investors that it is a responsible borrower, in order to lower external financing costs. This strategy has been broadly successful. However, the pandemic and the subsequent period of elevated consumer price inflation forced it to increase spending dramatically, such that the DPR passed new bills to permit the government to run much wider fiscal deficits. In 2023-27 the government will seek to maintain its reputation for prudence, while also trying to achieve its priorities, such as developing infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net.
- A period of high global commodity prices, at least in the first half of the forecast period, will provide the government with extra revenue from export sales. However, it will have to balance additional resources with the impact on consumers of more expensive food staples and inputs.

Indonesia will make strides in improving its policy towards private enterprise and competition in 2023-27, but similar improvements in other countries mean Indonesia's rank remains at 69th throughout the forecast period. Jokowi's administration has undertaken various measures to ease licensing processes and remove onerous regulations on small and medium-sized enterprises. The growth of online services in Indonesia has prompted the government to require local and foreign technology companies to register for licences to operate domestically. Nonetheless, we do not expect this requirement to stifle growth in the technology sector, which will be a growth driver in 2023-27.

- The government will continue to privatise and restructure some state-owned assets (including their subsidiaries) owing to fiscal constraints and efficiency concerns. This is also likely to increase competition and improve the business environment. The process will prove controversial and, in many cases, be subject to political and popular opposition. Progress will also vary by sectors. The country has a long history of prevarication over the desirable role of the market in the economy; ongoing debate on this subject will slow the pace of reform in 2023-27. It is also possible that the government's stance will shift considerably following the 2024 elections, as the tone is set by the president. Efforts by vested interests to maintain a system of protectionism and patronage will be more successful in some areas than others. Major public-sector corruption scandals will continue to be uncovered by the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK).

The authority's PPP initiative will benefit private businesses
- The government will return to its initiative of boosting the number of public-private partnerships (PPP) in 2023-27. It has made more sectors eligible for private investment through PPP structures, including tourism, education, health and the environment. Infrastructure will be another priority. The finance ministry will seek to block frontline ministries from disbursing state funding to projects offering higher rates of return, ensuring that limited state funds target less economical but strategically important projects.

Conditions for foreign investment will improve gradually in the next five years, enabling both Indonesia's score and its regional ranking to rise moderately. The size of the domestic market will ensure that capital flows increase as the country's young population-with its rising disposable income and rising access to credit-continues to spend. The publication of a Positive Investment List in May 2021, which replaces the "negative investment list" (DNI), means that more sectors are now being opened up for foreign direct investment. Notably, foreign investment in technology start-ups in Special Economic Zones is exempt from the minimum investment threshold of Rp10bn (US$673,400). This bodes well for the government's digitalisation push. However, long-standing concerns about nationalist-leaning court decisions and corruption will continue to inhibit potential inflows.

- An amendment to the 2009 mining law passed in 2020 requires foreign-owned mining companies to divest a 51% shareholding to domestic mining entities over the course of the forecast period. However, it allows for more flexibility in transferring the operating permit, despite the fact that approval is still needed from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. For decades Indonesia's natural-resources sector has attracted foreign investors, but the export of unprocessed mineral ores has been banned since 2014.
- The government intends to encourage the development of domestic refining capacity and to raise the value-added of exports. Rules issued in 2017 require miners to convert existing contracts into new licences, which would dilute existing rights and mean more onerous tax liabilities, and requires coal exporters to use local insurers and transporters. These will hinder foreign investment. However, large amounts of new investment are needed to upgrade ageing mines. The government's dependence on revenue from the mining sector means that it will not abandon or ease these restrictive policies in 2023-27. At the same time, the government will support and incentivise electronic vehicle battery manufacturers to set up nickel mines and plants in Indonesia, with the intention of keeping the value-added of finished products within the country. This will further be expanded to bauxite-related products in June 2023.
- Foreign businesses will continue to report quicker permit issuance owing to the single window established by the Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM). Jokowi has instructed ministries and agencies to streamline the payment of duties and other administrative requirements at the country's ports under a single window. This policy is broad in scope-more than a dozen ministries and government agencies are affected. It is therefore facing implementation challenges, but tangible changes from the policy will become increasingly apparent. The Job Creation Perppu further simplified business licensing for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises by implementing an online single submission system and acceleration of halal certification.
- In 2021 the government announced a major liberalisation of its DNI, which sets sectoral investment terms on foreign investment. The government will continue to group the economy into four sectors: priority areas where foreign investment is encouraged through tax and non-tax incentives (such as robotics and aircraft manufacturing); sectors where partnerships with local firms are required (including shipbuilding and sugar); industries with investment restrictions, where those with foreign-ownership ceilings reside (such as postal services and media outlets); and those that are closed for investments from both domestic and foreign companies. Inconsistent rulings by the Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) will also deter foreign investors, and local courts will sometimes fail to uphold the rights of foreign firms in the face of pressure from officials and domestic competitors.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls remains unchanged in 2023-27. Improvements in other countries mean that Indonesia's global and regional rankings fall from 53rd to 57th and from 11th to 12th respectively. The process of trade liberalisation will continue to make gradual progress, amid disagreements between economic liberals and nationalists over whether Indonesia benefits from free trade. The country has been a member of the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) ever since parliament ratified the trade pact in early 2023. The local currency, the rupiah, will remain freely convertible on the current account and for most capital-account transactions.
Non-tariff trade barriers will remain major obstacles to trade liberalisation
- Indonesia's use of non-tariff barriers will remain significant. The government regularly tinkers with lists of goods that are banned from being imported (to promote the development of local industries) or exported (to prevent shortages of domestically produced products) depending on market conditions and global prices. For example, exports of coal and palm oil were banned for several months in 2022 after local supplies had dwindled. Simultaneously, the government is trying to simplify the foreign trade regime; in late 2021 the Ministry of Trade issued a new, single guideline outlying categories of goods that were banned from entering and leaving the country. The Ministry of Industry has a wider strategic goal of reducing import reliance across sectors. Lobbying by local manufacturers of consumer electronics and garments will lead the government to maintain anti-dumping policies against foreign companies.
- RCEP will increase the trade flow of Indonesia within the region in the latter half of the forecast period. However, the push of demand will only be moderate, as existing free-trade agreements have reduced tariffs markedly. Harmonisation of regulations will integrate Indonesia into the regional supply chain. However, non-tariff barriers will remain prevalent even after RCEP comes into effect. Indonesia is also a participant of the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Discussions are still in the early stages and are likely to focus on technical co-ordination between IPEF participants, rather than boosting trade flows via improved market-access protocols.
- Bank Indonesia (BI, the central bank) will continue to intervene in the currency market, as well as lift local interest rates, to manage the value of the rupiah. The rupiah will appreciate slightly in late 2023 and 2024 as the Fed ends its monetary tightening cycle. However, in the later half of the forecast period we expect the rupiah to depreciate against the US dollar; BI will work to ensure that this weakening is gradual and does not result in large increases in the cost of borrowing from international markets. We do not expect the central bank to resort to large-scale capital controls to contain currency depreciation, but that remains a risk in the event of a serious deterioration in the economy.
- Minor restrictions on capital account activity will remain. In periods of external financial stress, BI will introduce regulations to raise the level of foreign exchange reserves or deter capital flight, such as imposing minimum holding periods for central bank bonds (known as BI certificates). The bank will continue to publish reforms to deepen the domestic capital market. The take-up of domestic non-deliverable forward contracts will lower hedging costs for companies and improve rupiah stability when the currency faces pressure.

Tax policy will emerge as an area of strength for Indonesia. Its global ranking in the taxes category rises from 48th in 2018-22 to 30th in 2023-27, but its regional position remains at 11th. Efforts of the minister of finance, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, to streamline the tax process to reduce tax avoidance, and the administration's roll-out of numerous tax incentives to encourage new investment underpin the increase in the score from 6 to 7.
Generous tax cuts will be introduced to attract investment into the new capital
- In early 2023, in a bid to hasten the development of the new capital city, Nusantara, the government announced generous incentives for foreign firms to invest there. These include a 100% corporate tax holiday for firms investing at least Rp10bn (US$673,400). The tax holiday will vary between ten to 30 years depending on the sector, with the longest term being awarded to investments in public services. Investments in the development of financial centres and companies that relocate their headquarters to the new capital will also enjoy corporate income tax reductions, while micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in certain business sectors will be fully exempted from corporate income taxes.
- Companies that invest in one of 245 priority sectors will be accorded tax incentives. These range from a 50% corporate income tax reduction for a period of five years, to a 100% corporate tax reduction for a period of up to 20 years, depending on the size of investment. Examples of priority business sectors include the automotive industry, pharmaceutical industry, and iron and steel industry. We expect the government to increase the number of priority sectors in the forecast period to further encourage investment.
- However, a deterioration in the public finances due to the coronavirus pandemic prompted the government to pass the Harmonisation of Tax Regulations (HPP) Law in 2021. The HPP introduced a rise in value-added tax from 10% to 11% from April 2022 and another rise, to 12%, at an unspecified time by January 2025. A new income tax bracket, of 35% for those earning above Rp5bn per year, was also introduced. Our expectation that the HPP will lead to an increase in the overall tax take is factored into our forecast for a narrowing budget deficit as a proportion of GDP in 2023-27. That said, the overall tax take will remain low relative to comparable economies, and this will limit the government's ability to spend to support and develop the economy.
- Another facet of the HPP is the introduction of a carbon tax. Initially, it applies only to coal-fired power stations and takes the form of a cap and tax system. Each power provider will be given a limit on their permitted emissions and any above this level will be subject to an additional tax of Rp30,000 (US$2) per kilogram. Although it was initially scheduled to be rolled out in April 2022, the carbon tax has been delayed repeatedly since then. Meanwhile the government launched the first phase of its carbon trading scheme in February 2023. Under the scheme, the government will impose an upper limit for carbon dioxide emissions on coal-fired power plants, based on their capacity. A carbon exchange to facilitate trading of carbon certificates is expected to be launched in the second half of 2023.

Expatriate workers will continue to enjoy tax exemptions
- The government will lessen the burden on expatriate workers by providing exemptions from worldwide taxation. Indonesia taxes expatriates on their income from wherever in the world it is generated, which means that employees working in Indonesia pay tax on assets regardless of country. This has made Indonesia a relatively less attractive place to work in South-east Asia. However, the Job Creation Perppu has relaxed this tax burden by allowing expatriates who have fulfilled specific requirements to only be taxed on Indonesian-paid income. In the coming years the finance ministry is likely to further relax these requirements, which will remove an obstacle to working in the country for employees in these roles. Additionally, certain groups of foreigners are exempted from private income taxes in Indonesia; these include diplomats, military personnel and representatives of specific international organisations.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Indonesia's score for financing improves from 5.1 to 5.9 in the forecast period, but more notable improvements in other countries mean that its global ranking falls from 59th to 60th. The opening up of more sectors to foreign investment as part of the Job Creation Perppu drives improvement in the score. We believe that by raising the foreign investment ceilings in sectors from healthcare to fisheries, the government will improve access to capital markets for foreigners. That said, we note the continued undercurrent of economic nationalism, which means that this investment may not be welcomed in every sector. The natural resources sector stands out as an area that is likely to remain starved of capital, partly because of more restrictive business environments than other sectors.
Credit growth will pick up from 2024 as interest rates fall
- Aided by a strict adherence to Basel III banking standards, commercial banks will remain adequately capitalised in 2023-27. The rate of credit growth is poised to pick up in line with a period of policy loosening that will begin in 2024. Weaknesses persist in credit-risk management at banks, but there has been steady improvement, helped by the creation of the independent Financial Services Authority (OJK) in 2011. New hedging requirements on companies seeking fresh external debt have slowed the growth of Indonesia's private-debt liability.
- Indonesia's banking system is among the most profitable in the world, with wide deposit-lending margins. The government will encourage the development of the non-bank financial sector in 2023-27, including the insurance, pension, mutual-fund, venture-capital and financial leasing industries. A 2017 regulation issued by the OJK caps lending from financial technology companies at Rp2bn per customer, amid strong growth in new peer-to-peer lenders registered with the authority. However, the ongoing weakness of nonbank finance in the country limits access to sources of long-term funding. Since 2015 private insurers and pension funds have had to compete with a national social security scheme, which provides employment benefits including old-age pensions, workplace-accident benefits and life insurance.

The Job Creation Perppu will lower severance costs for laid-off workers Indonesia's score for the labour market will improve significantly in 2023-27; its global ranking rises by 19 places to 40th and its regional position strengthens from 14th to 11th. The business environment will continue to face significant constraints from a lack of skilled workers, and hiring foreign staff will remain expensive. However, some much-needed flexibility has been brought into the labour market through the Job Creation Perppu. Severance payments have been cut, and restrictions on overtime, outsourcing and the roles that can be filled by foreign workers have all been relaxed. Sectoral minimum wages have also been replaced by rates set by provincial governments, although this is unlikely to markedly slow their growth. Trade unions complained noisily but to little effect. A new regulation issued in early 2023 also allows labour-intensive companies in certain sectors to adjust working hours and wages based on a mutual agreement with the company's labour union. We believe that the labour market will become more dynamic as a result. Other factors, such as an improvement in the quality of education and a moderate pace of inflation (making the cost of living cheaper than competitor economies), also contribute to a stronger score.

- Only 10-15% of the labour force is unionised, but historically labour unions achieved high nominal wage increases. However, wage inflation will moderate in 2023-27, and will be tied more closely to productivity. Organised labour movements led by union officials will continuously press for commensurately higher minimum wages, but this is unlikely to result in notable increases.
- There will be a gradual shift in geographical manufacturing concentration in the forecast period, with labour-intensive industries (particularly garments and textiles) migrating from the capital, Jakarta, and West Java to Central and East Java, where wages are lower. Government and industry efforts to build managerial colleges and vocational facilities in these regions will support this transition. Job creation in special economic zones will increase, albeit slowly. Local-content rules for smartphone and electric-vehicle manufacturers will lead to new assembly facilities.
- Efforts to streamline the hiring of foreign talent will continue, but progress will remain slow. In 2018 the government issued a regulation that simplified the process for acquiring foreign-worker permits. Notably, the Expatriate Placement Plan, which requires firms to hire an Indonesian counterpart for every foreign worker, has been removed for the most senior categories of foreign workers and for those scheduled to work for less than six months. Such reforms will support investment in higher-value-added sectors such as e-commerce. Additionally, a regulation enacted in early 2021 requires the Ministry of Manpower to review and decide on foreign workforce hiring applications within two business days to shorten the time taken to hire foreign nationals. That said, the government will remain cautious about reducing restrictions on foreign workers owing to a large and growing local labour force. Future administrations will continue to balance such policies with efforts to boost local skills in order to appease the electorate.

Business environment outlook: Infrastructure

In the infrastructure category, Indonesia's score has risen from 3.5 in 2017-21 to 4.5 in 2023-27, and the country's global ranking rises by seven places to 71st. Its regional position climbs to 14th. The country scores poorly in most sub-categories, with the exception of telecommunications. Indonesia's island-based geography, combined with limited fiscal resources, poses a challenge to its infrastructure development. That said, the government has ambitious plans and has made infrastructure a strategic priority. Achieving its goals at a time when it is trying to narrow its budget deficit will be tricky, however, and will require foreign investment.

- Indonesia faces some of the region's highest logistics costs, stemming from an underdeveloped rail and road network and inadequate electricity supplies. Moreover, it is reliant on a handful of overcrowded airports and ports. The government's budget allocation for infrastructure has been on an upward trend in recent years, reaching Rp392trn (US$26.4bn) in its 2023 budget. The majority of this allocation will go towards the provision of affordable and reliable basic energy services across the archipelago. The government will continue to promote PPPs in its projects. Additionally, the administration is encouraging local governments to spend money that has been languishing in regional banks, and BI is increasing its presence in all 34 provinces to expedite spending.
- The finance ministry will continue to issue green sharia-compliant bonds to fund applicable infrastructure projects throughout the forecast period. The government will also seek to attract blended finance via the Tri Hita Karana Roadmap. In 2022, this initiative mobilised US$30bn in initiatives on sustainable development. Soon after taking office in 2014 Jokowi signed a policy document mandating the construction of 200 infrastructure projects, around one-quarter of which are new toll roads. In 2019 Indonesia's first mass-rapid transit line opened in Jakarta; an extension of the current line began construction in early 2021. Further plans to extend the transit line will extend total rail length by 144km from the current 15.7km and will be completed in the mid-2030s.

Relocation of the capital will not be completed in the forecast period
- The biggest infrastructure project envisaged by the Jokowi administration is an ambitious relocation of the capital from Jakarta to a new location, christened Nusantara, in East Kalimantan. Legislation to permit the move and define the new city's boundaries was passed by the DPR in 2022. The establishment of a new body to deliver the project, the Nusantara National Capital Authority, was also approved. The scale of the project is daunting. The total cost of the project is estimated at Rp466trn, with the government expected to cover 20% of that amount. The remainder will be sourced through PPP tenders and private contracts. The government hopes to have basic infrastructure installed for the relocation of 17,000 civil servants and their families in 2024, and a further 60,000 in stages after 2025. We believe that the fate of the project will largely lie with Jokowi's successor, given that the government will struggle to make significant progress on the project in the period to 2024 and the presidential transition.
- Many of Jokowi's other priority infrastructure projects will also struggle to meet their delivery dates. The Jakarta Bay reclamation project, for example, will be delayed, but is still likely to be completed in the forecast period. The Jakarta-Bandung railway is expected to commence operations in June 2023, after being set back by multiple delays. New utility projects, such as geothermal plants, will also move slowly. However, several toll roads will open early in the forecast period, and these will cut logistics costs, with upsides for local productivity.

Indonesia's score for technological readiness rises from 4.4 in the historical period to 5.2 in the forecast period, pushing up its global ranking by five spots to 63rd and its regional ranking to 14th. The Palapa Ring, completed in 2019, resulted in 13,000km of undersea cable being laid to provide all of the country's provinces with fast internet connection, at the modest cost of US$1.5bn. The government is also keen to facilitate progress in high-tech sectors like robotics and advanced manufacturing, although we expect that progress will be limited.
The government will expand 5G services but this will be limited to major cities
- BI will issue additional policies to strengthen its 2017 regulatory framework for the National Payment Gateway, an online public-services payment platform. This will enable more consumers to access essential services online, such as electricity and mobile-phone data plans. We also expect access to credit through financial technology to improve in the forecast period. Logistics costs for e-commerce companies will fall as new and more efficient delivery systems make use of improving transport infrastructure and technology, in turn enhancing the competitiveness of online retail. The rollout of 5G services will begin mid-way through the forecast period, while 3G services will be gradually terminated.
- The National Cyber and Encryption Agency, established in 2018, will grow in capacity in the forecast period, helped in part by co-operation with other countries in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Singapore government, in particular. However, weaknesses in cyber-security will persist owing to the ubiquity of outdated and pirated software. The Ministry of Information and Technology will launch programmes to boost technology partnerships, which will involve both universities and local start-ups. Indonesia will continue to see few engineers graduating from university, which will hinder domestic innovation.

Economic forecast: Policy trends As global commodity prices (including that of oil) moderate in 2023, consumer price inflation in Indonesia will continue to ease. Policies aimed at softening the blow from inflation will be scaled back gradually. These policies have been centre-stage in the government's policy agenda in 2022 and early 2023, and include welfare aid and targeted subsidies for lower-income households.
The Job Creation Perppu will lower labour costs and reduce bureaucratic obstacles to investment. Although Jokowi's intervention calls into question the robustness of Indonesia's democracy, it reflects his administration's growing concern over a dimming global outlook in 2023 that could hamper economic growth. We now expect the government to formulate implementing legislation so that most components of the Job Creation Perppu come into effect by the end of 2023.
Infrastructure development will remain a priority, but progress will fall short of targets. The construction of a new national capital in East Kalimantan is scheduled for completion by early 2024, but we expect it to be delayed until at least 2025. The relocation will have minimal impact on congestion in Jakarta, the current capital, which will remain the economic centre of Indonesia throughout this decade. Other major infrastructure projects in the next five years will still be focused mainly on the islands of Java and Sumatra. Indonesia's first high-speed railway, connecting Jakarta with Bandung, the country's fourth-largest city, is expected to commence operations in June 2023. This will help to lower the elevated cost of passenger transport and logistics across Indonesia.
With less than a year left in Jokowi's term, his administration will accelerate its efforts to attract foreign direct investment to ensure economic growth in the medium term. These investments will be focused on the downstream processing and manufacturing industries (particularly those related to components in electric vehicles), as well as sustainable infrastructure in the new capital city. The government will remain committed to its climate change agenda. It introduced a carbon trading scheme in end-February, while a carbon exchange to facilitate trading of carbon certificates is expected to be launched in the second half of 2023. The government has also rolled out subsidies for consumer purchases of electric vehicles, which we expect will become a permanent feature of Indonesian policy in our forecast period.

Government debt 49.0 46.8 45.0 44.0 43.5 40.0
We forecast that the budget deficit will widen to the equivalent of 2.9% of GDP in 2023, from an estimated 2.4% of GDP in 2022. The budget deficit will remain below the fiscal cap of 3% of GDP that was set in August 2022, despite expenditure tied to income assistance and a minimum-wage increment in 2023. The reduction of fuel subsidies will contain growth in the government's expenditure this year, but this will be partially offset by a moderation of tax receipts as a consequence of the anticipated global and domestic economic slowdown.
The deficit will narrow in the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting recent and future increases in direct taxes, as well as new commodity export levies. In 2022 the government introduced a higher bracket of 35% for personal income tax and increased the standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) from 10% to 11%. New export levies on commodities, including on nickel (refined grades), tin and bauxite (ores), will probably be implemented in 2023. The government will also impose an excise tax on all sweetened beverages and plastic products in 2023. In addition, we believe that the government will proceed with raising the VAT rate to 12% in 2025. The narrowing deficit will contribute to a gradual decline in the public debt/GDP ratio, from an estimated 49% in 2022 to 40% in 2027.

Lending rate (av) 8.5 8.9 8.3 8.1 8.4 8.7
Deposit rate (av) 3.2 4.0 3.7 3.3 3.4 3.8
We expect Bank Indonesia (BI, the central bank) to leave its policy rate unchanged at a terminal rate of 5.75% for the rest of 2023, after raising it to that level in January 2023. To date, the policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 225 basis points since August 2022.
As inflation moderates and external demand and global prices for key commodity exports ease, BI's focus in late 2023 and 2024 will pivot towards supporting economic growth. We forecast a 25-basis-point cut in the policy rate in the first quarter of 2024, and a further 50-basis-point cut in the second quarter, leaving the rate at 5% for the remainder of 2024.
The policy rate will remain below the average recorded in the decade before the pandemic, setting the stage for further tightening from 2026 as domestic demand growth firms amid favourable external conditions.
In December 2022 the DPR passed omnibus legislation that expanded BI's mandate to include maintaining stability in the payment and financial system, in order to support economic growth. This permits the central bank to purchase government bonds during crises, creating the risk of jeopardising price and exchange-rate stability, and undermining investor confidence in the economy.
The reappointment of the BI governor, Perry Warjiyo, for a second five-year term beginning in May 2023 will ensure policy continuity amid the current period of elevated inflation and uncertainty in the global financial system. In 2024 the central bank will lower its inflation target from 2%-4% currently to 1.5-3.5%.

Real GDP growth will moderate from an estimated 5.3% in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023. High inflation in late 2022 and the first half of 2023 will undermine private consumption growth, but this will return to trend over 2025-27 as household incomes catch up with price rises.
By contrast, goods exports will remain fairly robust in 2023, despite an expected downturn in the global economy, reflecting growth in Indonesia's mining output and downstream metal-processing industries. Elevated global commodity prices in 2022 have boosted corporate profits. This has facilitated industrial investment, which will ensure that growth (expenditure measure) remains resilient in 2023-27. The tourism sector will also rebound moderately in 2023-24 as China (Indonesia's second-biggest source of inbound tourists) relaxes its remaining quarantine measures and border restrictions in early 2023.
Strong investment in industries based on hard commodities and downstream processing in 2023 will partially offset the impact of monetary policy tightening on investment in other parts of the economy. The Job Creation Perppu will boost private investment modestly in 2023-27, primarily via increased construction and mining activity. Indonesia will struggle to compete for foreign investment in labour-intensive manufacturing; corruption and high wages by regional standards will be the main obstacles. Nonetheless, in the medium term targeted industrial policy will lead to significant gains in a range of capital-intensive industries, including metals, chemicals, electronic components and automotive manufacturing.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The services sector has been the primary engine of economic growth in recent years, expanding at an average annual rate of 4.2% in 2018-22 (including a contraction in 2020 because of the pandemic) and constituting 46.9% of nominal GDP on a factor cost basis in 2022. However, the industrial sector will be the fastest-growing sector, expanding by an annual average of 6.2% in 2023-27. Growing at an average of 4.8%, services will remain Indonesia's next fastest-growing sector in the next five years, and agriculture will lag behind at 3.7% over the same period. Growth in telecommunications services will be robust. Mobile-phone ownership and cellular data coverage will be extended and tariffs will be increasingly affordable, enabling more Indonesians-who are enthusiastic users of social media and online commerce-to communicate electronically.
The tourism sector will pick up in 2023 but will not reach pre-pandemic levels The tourism sector will recover gradually in 2023, but we expect tourism activity to recover to pre-pandemic levels only in 2024. Some areas of Indonesia are emerging as luxury destinations for high-end tourism and residences for wealthy "digital nomad" expatriates. Deficiencies in Indonesia's transport infrastructure could stunt the sector's potential growth. Furthermore, regional competition for tourism will remain intense. However, the number of visitors from emerging markets elsewhere in Asia will also rise rapidly, given the country's convenient location and tourist attractions. The introduction of a new criminal code that bans individuals from engaging in extramarital sex and cohabitation, which comes into effect in 2025, is unlikely to have a major impact on foreign tourists, but this could pave the way for more conservative rules in the future.
The performance of the industrial sector has been held back by persistent under-investment. The current administration is committed to raise investment into the sector. Indonesia is likely to benefit moderately through manufacturing diversification caused by US-China tensions and rising wages in China. However, its ability to gain more foreign direct investment (FDI) will be hindered by business environment concerns. The authorities hope to formulate a complete supply chain for electric vehicles, as the country has large reserves of nickel and bauxite-raw materials used in the manufacture of batteries and aluminium respectively. The government's decision to ban the export of nickel ore in late 2019 has been relatively successful in spurring foreign direct investment in downstream segments of the value chain. This will prompt the government to enact similar bans in other industries and will maintain the ban on nickel exports in the forecast period. The government will continue to prioritise improving the environment for manufacturers amid growing demand for better-paid jobs in the formal sector.
The government's efforts will improve the business environment, but we believe that the investment regime will remain flawed and nationalistic. The importance of the agricultural sector will continue to decline.

Consumer price inflation peaked in late 2022 and will continue to decelerate in 2023, but prices of food and fuel will remain elevated (Indonesia is a net importer of both commodities). However, the headline rate of inflation will remain above 4% on a year-on-year basis until mid-2023. Inflation will moderate thereafter to average 3.9% in 2023 (near the upper limit of BI's target range of 2-4%), owing to easing global commodity prices.
Consumer price inflation will moderate further in 2024 as a wider range of global commodity prices ebb and the lagging effects of tighter monetary policy are felt on demand. Prices will firm thereafter as demand strengthens, but inflation will be modest by historical standards, with overall prices increasing by an average of 3.5% in 2027, close to the new upper limit set by BI from 2024 onwards.

We forecast that the local currency will gradually weaken against the US dollar following a bout of appreciation in January 2023. This trend will reverse from mid-2023 as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) ends its monetary tightening cycle. We forecast that the currency will stand at Rp15,154:US$1 at end-2023.
A return to a current-account deficit from 2025, as well as accelerating inflation later in the forecast period will ensure that the rupiah depreciates against the US dollar in both nominal and real terms in 2025-27. Occasional heightened volatility will prompt intervention by the central bank, but we do not expect the central bank to hold back movements for prolonged periods.

We forecast that Indonesia's goods trade surplus will remain wide by historical standards in 2023 as high shipment volumes partially offset the decline in global prices. Transport and insurance costs associated with Indonesia's commodity exports will keep the services deficit sizeable. An anticipated gradual recovery in tourism in 2023-24 will ease this deficit but will be insufficient to offset it. We expect the overall current-account surplus to narrow from 0.8% of GDP in 2023 and to 0.1% in 2024.
The current account will slip into deficit in 2025, but the shortfall as a ratio of GDP will be modest compared with previous years, despite declining commodity prices. The growth of value-added downstream processing and manufacturing activity will expand and diversify Indonesia's export basket in the latter part of the forecast period. However, these activities, along with mining, will remain heavily foreign-invested, resulting in a sizeable primary income deficit as firms repatriate profits.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Indonesia Stocks and flows Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into Indonesia has been the administration's priority. FDI inflows have nevertheless been subject to disruptions, owing to the government's inability to implement reforms rapidly. When the president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), took office in 2014, the country received US$25.1bn in FDI inflows. In 2022 inflows stood at US$21.7bn-a rise from US$21.2bn in 2021. EIU estimates that the stock of inward FDI reached US$354.5bn in 2022, equivalent to 26.9% of GDP in that year. FDI inflows are forecast to grow in 2023 as the government introduces incentives to attract foreign investment into the development of the new capital city, but they will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2026.
Origin and distribution Indonesia's largest source of FDI remains its more affluent partners in Asia. In 2022 Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Japan were the most significant sources of FDI, according to data from Indonesia's Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM). In particular, Chinese investment into Indonesia's infrastructure sector has been rising rapidly. Indonesia falls within China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and has been a beneficiary of loans from the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). In 2022 the metal sector was the largest beneficiary of foreign investment, followed by mining. The natural resources subsector, which is subject to heavy regulation and protectionism, is becoming less attractive to foreign investors. The government will continue to promote the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors to foreign investors, in a bid to diversify the economy away from natural resources and develop a high-skilled workforce.
Determinants Historically, Indonesia's protectionist reputation has deterred foreign investors. Heavy-handed regulation, red tape and land-acquisition issues have made the business environment especially challenging. Addressing much of this has been the focus of Jokowi's administration since it took charge in 2014. The government has managed to make some progress: early in its term, the BKPM launched a one-stop licensing platform. Shortly after that, Jokowi released 15 reform packages to deregulate various sectors. The Job Creation Perppu, ratified in 2023, will improve Indonesia's business environment moderately. A new "positive investment list" released in February 2021 has liberalised many sectors to foreign investment. However, institutional weakness persists, undermining the business environment. The legal system lacks transparency, tends to favour the political elite, and sometimes appears to discriminate against foreign interests; this is particularly the case in the natural resources subsector. Disproportionately large rises in minimal wages with discrepancies across provinces are still likely to be implemented. Finally, security threats, particularly of terrorist attacks remain a persistent cause for concern for foreign investors. The Indonesian authorities have proven to be capable of containing such threats, but low-level attacks in major cities and tourist destinations, including the capital, Jakarta, as well as isolated cases of sabotage by separatist groups in resource-rich regions have still occurred in recent years.
Impact FDI is often controversial in Indonesia. Mining firms, in particular, are criticised frequently and have been taken to court for breaking environmental and other laws. A restriction against exporting raw mineral ores that was installed in 2014 became a point of contention for many large foreign mining companies and the government. The law attempts to encourage mining companies to build processing and smelting facilities in Indonesia, in order to raise the value of the commodities being exported. Consequently, there has been a sizeable gap between the value of FDI projects receiving approval and the number and size of projects that are actually implemented. The trend has been particularly marked in the case of larger, capital-intensive projects, many of which have been postponed or delayed indefinitely. In recent years more manufacturing FDI has materialised; this has created jobs in the more-developed West Java region. The authorities will attempt to attract more FDI to the less-developed regions of Central Java and East Kalimantan (the province which will house the new capital city) with improved infrastructure.
Potential With a steadily growing economy and a large middle-class population, Indonesia offers significant investment opportunities for businesses, beyond the traditional natural resources sector, which has driven investment to date. With the government focused on improving the business environment, the new reform could lead to healthy FDI growth. Jokowi also managed to gain enough political capital to place technocratic ministers in crucial economic portfolios. The finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a former director at the World Bank, has been instrumental in boosting investor sentiment by ensuring prudent fiscal policy before the pandemic. However, many regulatory and business environmental issues remain unaddressed, and we expect this to frustrate the government's goal of making Indonesia an export manufacturing hub. Nonetheless, a huge and increasingly affluent domestic market is more than adequate to attract more FDI into Indonesia in 2023-27.

A young population will ensure that the labour force remains dynamic EIU expects Indonesia's demographics to remain favourable in the forecast period (2023-27). The population will grow at a healthy rate of 0.8% per year on average over this period, and Indonesia will therefore remain as the most populous country in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN): at 272m in 2022, Indonesia's population constituted approximately 40% of the ASEAN total. Over the forecast period the population will remain fairly young, with the labour force rising to 147.8m by the end of 2027, from 143.7m in 2022. Research conducted by the OECD in 2017 suggests that, in the medium term, Indonesia will be one of the countries in ASEAN that is least affected by ageing, based on the projection that for each person aged 65 and above, there will be at least 4.3 adults in the working-age population.
The results of Indonesia's last census, undertaken in 2020, showed a continued slowdown in the population growth rate over the previous decade, suggesting that the government's much-vaunted family-planning programme has had some success. A gradual slowdown in the population growth will prove positive in the medium term for standards of living, as it will push up GDP per head more rapidly. Meanwhile higher life expectancy, a falling birth rate and a stable death rate will reinforce the steady ageing of the population.
The 2020 census also showed that population distribution and growth rates varied markedly across provinces. The population of resource-rich Kalimantan, which grew most rapidly in 2001-20, continues to expand apace, and-given the burgeoning labour requirements of palm oil plantations and the upcoming capital city-migration to this region will remain strong over the forecast period. However, Java showed a relative decline in population, with 56.1% of Indonesians living in the region in 2020, from 57.4% in 2010. Regional imbalances in the distribution of the country's population will persist in the longer term, owing to uneven economic opportunities.
The population imbalance is also representative of the economic divide between provinces of Indonesia. There is a large income gap between resource-rich and poor provinces, and little progress has been made to bridge this divide in recent years. In 12 years, the income gap between East Kalimantan (the province with the highest GDP per head after Jakarta, the capital) and East Nusa Tenggara (the province with the lowest GDP per head), narrowed from 12.6 times to a still-wide 11 times. The relocation of the national capital to East Kalimantan province will encourage further migration into the region. The construction of the new capital will include offices and homes for 1.5m civil servants, with the first wave of personnel arriving by August 2024. This is unlikely to offset the increase in the province's GDP, leading to a deterioration of the economic divide between this region and the rest of Indonesia.
The Human Development Report 2020, published by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), ranked Indonesia 107th out of 189 countries in terms of human development indicators. The authorities have improved living and education standards, but there remains significant scope for further progress. Poverty rates were on a declining trend before the onset of the pandemic in 2020. After two consecutive quarters of increases, the poverty rate plateaued at 10.1% in March 2021, before gradually falling to 9.5% in March 2022.
Indonesians will live longer, healthier lives but will trail their regional peers Many of the country's health indicators have registered vast improvements in the past 30 years. However, average life expectancy-at 71.6 years in 2021-remains low by regional standards, and will remain so, despite rising to a projected 71.6 years in 2027. The infant mortality rate is high, at an estimated 19.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022. It is forecast to fall further, to 17.6 by 2027. Indonesia's healthcare spending as a proportion of GDP has been rising, despite a dip in 2008. An ambitious healthcare reform introduced in 2014, which aims to achieve universal health insurance, will help to fuel this growth. The government launched a campaign in January 2021 to reduce the fertility rate to 2.1 children per woman by 2025, while simultaneously improving other factors including health, education and employment. We expect the government to miss its target fertility rate owing to the prevailing high rates outside urbanised provinces on Java island, but it will continue to expand the public healthcare system over the forecast period albeit with incremental improvements.

With increasing purchasing power, Indonesians will buy more luxury goods Indonesia's sizeable and upwardly mobile population makes it an attractive market for a variety of sectors. Aside from a recession in 2020, the country will retain its position as one of the fastest-growing economies in the region in 2023-27 and is expected to maintain a pro-business stance throughout the forecast period, making it a good prospect for new investment. The vast majority of Indonesians earn low incomes, with GDP per head standing at US$4,848 at market exchange rates in 2022-one of the lower levels in the region. EIU expects GDP per head to rise to US$5,941 by 2027 on the back of sustained growth bolstered by the development of downstream industries and e-commerce. Indonesia's urbanisation rate is forecast to reach 61.6% in 2027 from 58% in 2022; however, this is likely to be skewed by the high urban density in the capital city, Jakarta, that is not reflected in other regions.
Indonesia's economy is consumption-driven. We forecast that retail sales will rise significantly in the latter half of the forecast period. Moreover, the growing disposable incomes of the general population and the presence of an aspirational young population will eventually boost discretionary spending.
Consumption patterns in Indonesia remain concentrated on low-priced goods, rather than luxury or branded items, owing to relatively low income levels across the country. The retail market remains dominated by informal vending, particularly in peripheral provinces. However, the country's sizeable middle class and large urban population are increasingly demanding higher-value non-durable and luxury goods, many of which are imported. In 2023-27 the income divide between the more urbanised and faster-developing provinces, such as West Java, and others that are more dependent on the primary sector, such as provinces in the Sulawesi regions, will remain wide. Therefore, market opportunities will differ accordingly.
With relatively extensive and rapidly deepening broadband penetration and the popularity of smartphones and social media, Indonesia offers huge potential for e-commerce. Nevertheless, the relative weakness of payment and delivery systems means that such services will remain highly concentrated in the larger metropolitan areas of Jakarta (the capital), Surabaya and Medan in the early part of the forecast period, but the market potential remains substantial. Jakarta is one of the top cities in the world in terms of the number of social media users. Smartphone penetration, particularly in the large metropolises, has allowed many service providers to thrive on the e-commerce platform. Consumer lending through e-commerce platforms is also building momentum, partly because of an encouraging regulatory environment provided by the Financial Services Authority (OJK). Ride-hailing and delivery services such as Gojek (a motorcycle taxi and delivery app) and Grab (a Singapore-based taxi-hailing app) have been thriving owing to the poor supply of public transport facilities in dense urban areas. A local e-commerce giant, Tokopedia, has grown markedly. Shopee and Lazada (both of Singapore) have also been successful in the market.
Advancements in financial technology will accelerate consumer spending Digital wallet providers gained significant momentum in recent years. Movement restrictions during the pandemic had expanded the reach of digital transactions, as consumers shifted from in-store to online payments. According to Bank Indonesia (the central bank), payments conducted through its national digital payment mechanism, the Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard, reached Rp98.5trn (US$6.6bn), more than triple the value recorded in 2021. Global technology investors are looking into the market for its favourable demographic and rising economies; this is especially the case for Chinese investors, who have found that their way to invest in India has been jeopardised by restrictions that require all Chinese-origin foreign direct investment to be reviewed and approved by the government.

The rebound of the tourism industry will further invigorate the retail and services sectors. We forecast that the share of spending on food will decrease slightly in the latter part of the forecast period, with more spending being allocated to items in the clothing and footwear, and the transport and communication categories. Indonesia also has the world's largest Muslim population, which will sustain substantial demand for halal products in the food and healthcare sectors. Urban areas, which accommodate more than half of the population, have become the focus of most retail activities.

Initial conditions: Indonesia is the largest economy in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), but GDP per head remains relatively low, at US$4,848 at market exchange rates in 2022. The years immediately following the fall of Suharto in 1998 were characterised by political instability, which deterred investors and delayed Indonesia's recovery from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. In 2004 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was elected president. During his decade-long term he established relative political stability. The country now has a reformist government, led by the president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), who has overseen improvements to business environment and attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) to finance much-needed infrastructure development. The public finances are now relatively healthy. However, corruption is still endemic, despite the fact that official attempts to reduce graft have made progress. The judicial system is weak, easily manipulated by the political and business elite, and sometimes perceived as discriminating against foreign interests.
Demographic trends: Indonesia's population will grow by an annual average of 0.51% in 2023-50. The country will benefit from the demographic dividend in the short to medium term as the working-age population continues to grow and is becoming more educated. However, towards the end of the forecast period, a falling birth rate and increases in the senior population will present challenges for social policies and healthcare infrastructure. The retirement age in 2023 is 58 years, and since 2019 it will have increased by one year for every three calendar years until it reaches 65 years in 2043. Urbanisation will continue; such expansion will increase the pressure on urban infrastructure, which remains inadequate to meet the needs of the population.
External conditions: Despite tensions between the US and China, EIU believes that trade proliferation will be a defining long-term feature in South-east Asia. Indonesia's external sector will benefit from the single-market ASEAN Economic Community, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (a multilateral trade pact), and the recently launched Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Indonesia will enjoy wider market access to more affluent economies. To tap into this trend, Indonesia will depend on the ability of successive governments to move away from trade protectionism, improve the business operating environment and develop infrastructure. These changes will take time to materialise. The size of the domestic market and the wealth of natural resources will continue to attract foreign investors, which will ensure healthy levels of exports and investment growth in the decades ahead. As trade negotiations develop, Indonesia will benefit from its geographic position, given its location at the heart of the trade routes of Asia and Australasia. Such initiatives will also require successive presidents of Indonesia to adopt a prominent lead in the regions and if they do so, Indonesia will deepen its role in regional supply chains.
Institutions and policy trends: Indonesia's democratic processes will become more entrenched in the long term. Civil society will be more active amid rising literacy; as a result, successive governments will be under pressure to improve the political environment and eradicate corruption. As the largest economy in ASEAN, Indonesia will become an important player on the global stage and is likely to play a leading role in the functioning of ASEAN. Therefore, it will have a more prominent role in international organisations. Given Indonesia's non-aligned tradition, we expect that foreign policy will continue to be neutral, even amid growing conflict between the US and China. Indonesia's relationship with both countries is expected to be generally cordial. The country is also likely to actively advocate against the pressure of "choosing sides" between the US and China.
Long-term performance: Indonesia's large consumer market will lead to an economic shift from exports of raw commodities towards more manufacturing- and services-oriented growth. However, the commodities sectors will remain important, given that Indonesia holds abundant reserves of strategic resources such as nickel and bauxite. Successive governments will not only need to continue with the current administration's focus on improving the business environment, but also invest in human development factors, especially education and healthcare, to ensure sustainable long-term expansion. The country's demographic dividend and growing market opportunities will remain attractive to foreign investors. With its vulnerable geographic and climatic position, Indonesia will have to brace for the impact of global climate change on its long-term economic performance. It will be susceptible to intensified geopolitical competition, but the sheer size of the economy and flexible non-alignment make it less prone to this risk than many of its regional peers and exercise more leadership in the region.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Indonesia has the second most bio-diverse ecosystem in the world after Brazil. As a result, changes to its environment affect regional weather patterns and raise risks of natural disasters. The country's archipelagic geography and extensive low-lying areas make its rural areas vulnerable to rising sea levels and global warming. According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), Indonesia is the eighth-largest greenhouse-gas emitter in the world in 2019. The country is a signatory of the Paris Agreement, and aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 32% than a business-as-usual scenario in 2030, and by 43% if it is provided with international financial assistance. Successive governments will continue to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles by providing incentives and expanding charging infrastructure in major cities across the country. The country has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in 2060. Two factors that will continue to determine emissions levels in Indonesia will be land use and energy sourcing. The country primarily uses coal-fired furnaces for electricity generation. The current government will continue to push for alternative fuels and renewable energy to account for a larger portion of Indonesia's energy mix. More adoption of hydropower and natural gas power plants will allow Indonesia to meet its energy demand while phasing out coal-fired power plant.
In the mid-2000s expansive forest clearing for the cultivation of palm oil led to severe deterioration of Indonesia's peat lands-a big source of carbon when burnt. In 2015 severe and widespread forest fires due to peat land clearing created an international pollution crisis. A moratorium for a new palm oil plantation has been removed in 2021, creating space for further deforestation. However, the authorities aim to reduce carbon emissions from the forestry sector to offset for emissions in the development of manufacturing. Environment regulations in other parts of the world, such as the EU, might force the authorities to attempt to reduce environmentally-unfriendly exports. EIU expects the primacy of coal and palm oil exports to decline from mid-2030 onwards. We believe that climate change will depress the country's long-term growth potential and that the economy will be 2.8% smaller in 2050 than would otherwise be the case.
Technological developments In April 2018 the president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), officially launched a roadmap covering the period to 2030 for "Industry 4.0"-defined as the use of fourth-generation (4G) technology in manufacturing and industry. The president's plans are ambitious, given Indonesia's still-weak infrastructure and relatively nascent technological use in manufacturing; many traditional industries that are labour-intensive have resisted automation for decades, for fear of job losses and labour-union-provoked instability. Therefore, the Jokowi administration's plans focus on propelling Indonesia's export sector from low to high value through technological transformation and attracting foreign investment on technology-heavy industries. However, according to the World Bank, Indonesia's research and development expenditure as a share of GDP, stood at just 0.3% in 2020, well below the 2.3% average of East Asia and the Pacific (excluding high-income countries). We expect expenditure to rise in 2023-50, but it will remain below the average. As the trend continues technological improvement will partially offset the productivity losses associated with an ageing population.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows the EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by the EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by the EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The centre-right New Democracy (ND) government, led by the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is in the last three months of its four-year mandate. A deadly train crash in February 2023 has ignited public anger, upended the government's election plans and changed all calculations about the probable outcome of the next election. EIU assumes that it will be impossible to form a government after the election, which is likely to be in May, necessitating a second poll. We expect that support for ND will suffer as a result of the train collision and that it may also prove difficult to form a government after a second election. Greece is entering a period of heightened political uncertainty, which may have damaging consequences for the government's reform agenda. The outcome of the coming polls will depend in part on how the government responds to the deadly accident in coming months. The opposition parties will not necessarily benefit from the backlash against the state and the government, which may lead to abstention at the polls.

- Economic reforms undertaken since 2015, and especially since the election in July 2019 of a pro-business centre-right government, have improved the outlook for the business environment in Greece. Owing to progress across many categories, Greece's score rises from 5.77 in the historical period (2018-22) to 6.99 in the forecast period (2023-27), pushing up its global ranking by 19 places, to 36th. However, Greece remains near the bottom of the regional ranking, at 15th.

- The Greek economy rebounded strongly from the pandemic-induced recession of 2020, with real GDP growing by a cumulative 14% in 2021-22, despite the negative impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, the sustained negative impact of high energy prices and inflation will weigh on household consumption and external demand in 2023, when growth is set to slow sharply. EU recovery funds and a continued recovery in tourism will support growth, but these will be offset by high interest rates and inflation, potential short-term energy shortages and a slowdown in euro zone markets. We forecast a pick-up in real GDP growth to 2.6% in 2024 and 3.4% per year in 2025-27 as the energy crisis eases and the impact of the war in Ukraine recedes.

Population growth   -0.6 -0.4
Working-age population growth   -0.8 -0.6
Labour force growth   -0.3 0.2

- According to UN projections, the population will decline by an average of 0.4% per year in 2023-27 (the forecast period). At the same time, life expectancy is increasing, and in 2021 it was estimated to average 81.8 years-broadly in line with the EU27 average. The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with the decline in the working-age population and rise in the elderly population (65 years and older) projected to continue. The proportion of people aged over 65 is forecast to rise from an estimated 22.7% in 2021 to 24.7% in 2027. Population ageing will prove to be a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.

- During the covid-19 pandemic GDP per head (at market exchange rates) slumped to US$18,010 in 2020-well below the EU average. This is forecast to rise to US$28,170 by 2027. This primarily reflects a relatively robust recovery in GDP, from a low base, but also a shrinking population. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had negative spillovers, but have also spurred positive changes, for example by accelerating digitalisation and the energy transition. The recovery of the tourism industry and the associated real estate sector will also revive market opportunities.

- We expect real GDP to grow at 2.6% per year on average in 2023-30 (3.1% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 2.2% (2.7% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 2.9% per year over the entire long-term forecast period (2023-50). These impressive growth rates reflect catch-up growth in Greece, after the previous decade-long period of crisis and negative growth after 2010. However, the working-age population and labour force will shrink and will be a constraint, preventing faster catch-up growth rates.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign-debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's elevated public debt put the country's EMU membership into question, but that risk has receded.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. The 2010 crisis shook the traditional party system. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after its return to democracy in the mid-1970s-namely New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which was in power in 2015-19, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA). However, in July 2019 ND returned to power and XA failed to win enough votes to enter parliament.
Policy issues: Greece exited its third economic-adjustment programme in August 2018, but will be subject to monitoring by its euro zone creditors for decades. The covid-related public-health crisis led to agreed fiscal targets and some structural reforms being put on hold. In the short term the government's main focus will be to implement its reform programme to maximise the use of grants and loans under the EU recovery fund, and responding to the economic challenges created by the war in Ukraine. In the medium to long term, the main challenges will be putting Greece's public finances on a sustainable footing, diversifying economic activity to reduce overdependence on tourism, improving the business environment, reviving the privatisation programme and reducing still-high levels of non-performing loans.
Taxation: The tax rate is 22% on corporate profits and 5% on distributed dividends. The top personal income-tax rate is 45%. The standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 24%, but temporary cuts and payment deferrals have applied since the pandemic.
Foreign trade: In 2022 goods exports (fob) totalled US$56.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to US$97.5bn. The current account registered a deficit of US$21.2bn, equivalent to 9.9% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Following the July 2019 general election the centre-right New Democracy (ND) party, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was returned to office with a majority of 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The ND government replaced a coalition comprising the dominant left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza), led by Alexis Tsipras, and the smaller, hardline nationalist Independent Greeks (ANEL). Several parties represented in the previous parliament, such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA), failed to reach the 3% vote threshold for parliamentary representation. In 2020, after a trial that had lasted five and a half years, an Athens court sentenced 57 leaders, members and associates of XA to a total of more than 500 years in prison on charges ranging from murder and assault to running or participating in a criminal organisation. In February 2023 parliament approved a motion that effectively banned the National Party-Greeks, founded by a convicted former member of Golden Dawn, Ilias Kasidiaris, from participating in the forthcoming election. The motion amended the electoral law to prohibit the participation in elections of parties led by convicted members of a criminal or terrorist organisation. Even before the political fallout from a deadly train crash on February 28th 2023, opinion polls showed that ND and Syriza had lost ground since the 2019 election, while the centre-left alliance Movement for Change (Kinal), which was rebranded as Pasok-Kinal in May 2022, had improved its standing.

Political outlook: Political stability A disastrous head-on collision between a passenger and a freight train on February 28th has changed all calculations about the timing and outcome of elections in 2023. The accident, which claimed at least 57 lives, including those of many students and young people, has led to an outpouring of grief and anger against the authorities. The ND government is under great pressure and has put aside plans to dissolve parliament and hold an election on April 9th. EIU expects that an election will be held in mid to late May, with a second poll being likely in late June or early July. Meanwhile, the government is in damage control mode and is prioritising dealing with the urgent rail safety and other issues arising from the crash.
The next election will be run on a proportional representation system and is unlikely to yield a viable government. The allocation of a bonus of up to 50 seats (in the 300-member parliament) to the highest-polling party will be reinstated in the election immediately following the next one. However, it is questionable whether a second election will be able to deliver a single-party government. Even if the initial anger subsides in the coming months, voters are unlikely to be forgiving at the polls whenever they are held.
Opposition parties have sought to ride the wave of public anger and unleashed a barrage of criticism against ND. However, losses for ND will not necessarily result in gains for the opposition, which cannot claim to have a good track record of managing the country's infrastructure or addressing the problems of the rail system. Instead, the tragedy is likely to encourage a higher abstention rate and a bigger protest vote, especially among the young. Syriza stands to lose the most in such an event, as the highest percentage of 18-24-year-old voters back the party.
The political blame game that is now unfolding over the fatal train crash will make for an ugly political atmosphere in the country and will preclude any chance of party co-operation and the formation of a coalition government. The chances of a coalition between ND and the centre-left Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) had already dwindled following a spyware scandal in 2022, and intemperate attacks on the government by Pasok leaders after the train crash have further soured relations. A poor showing for Syriza at the next election would make it impossible for its leader, Alexis Tsipras, to form a coalition government with Pasok and MeRA25, a smaller left-wing party. Until a new government is formed, Greece will have an interim government led by ND, so political instability will be contained. However, a long period of election uncertainty would nevertheless hamper Greece's efforts to leave the instability of the 2010s behind it.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Greece scores poorly in relation to other developed economies on political and institutional effectiveness, as a result of the high levels of corruption, patronage and inefficiency affecting the government and the legal system. However, we expect a gradual improvement during the forecast period, driven by reforms carried out since the 2019 general election. Under the terms of Greece's financial assistance package, which expired in August 2018, the authorities committed to implementing a far-reaching reform of the public administration, judiciary and society more broadly. The ND government of 2019-23 has provided fresh momentum to the reform process, enacting reforms intended to improve government effectiveness, including one containing measures to address major shortcomings in the public administration. The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 spurred efforts to implement digitalisation of many aspects of the public administration.
The establishment of a modern state and public administration was one of the four pillars of the reform agenda under the bail-out programme and the post-bail-out enhanced surveillance regime overseen by Greece's euro zone creditors in 2015-22. The main priorities have been to control the size and cost of the public sector and at the same time increase the efficiency of the public administration in the delivery of essential public goods and services. Reforms have been designed aimed at strengthening the institutional and operational independence of major institutions, such as revenue administration and the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), as well as improving the efficiency of the judicial system and tackling corruption.
Action to strengthen the public-sector recruitment system is continuing Efforts to reduce the size of the public administration have borne fruit, with the total number of civil servants having fallen from 900,000 in December 2018 to 820,000 at the end of 2021 (600,000 permanent and 220,000 temporary staff). There has also been some success in converting temporary positions into permanent positions. To increase its control over the hiring of temporary staff, the ND government reduced the number of exceptions used to bypass temporary staff hiring procedures. At the same time, the government strengthened the efficiency of the civil service recruitment system and reduced political interference by increasing the capacity of the Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection (ASEP), the authority responsible for civil service recruitment, by the end of 2022. The measures include stronger competition procedures, scoring classification procedures, temporary staff hiring procedures and the reorganisation of ASEP.
The European Commission's quarterly enhanced surveillance reviews have highlighted that there has been uneven progress in the depoliticisation of the public administration. This was supposed to be accomplished through renewal of the top management and the implementation of new selection procedures for all levels of senior management, including the replacement of political appointees. The Commission has also noted mixed progress in efforts to increase the efficiency of the judicial system, which is needed to enhance the business environment and revive investment. Greece's judicial system remains burdened by an excessive backlog of cases, especially tax cases (appealing tax decisions can take up to 12 years). The sector is subject to frequent strikes by the courts and the Bar Association.
In terms of the anti-corruption agenda, the ND government has made progress in implementing the relevant action plan, including through the adoption of recommendations by the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). The authorities have repeatedly amended the legal framework for the financing of political parties to bring it into line with European best practice.
Following the end of the enhanced surveillance regime in August 2022, the Commission reported favourably about the results in November 2022. The government has accelerated digitalisation and technological adoption across many sectors, including the public administration, education and training, health, tourism, justice, employment, and culture. An end-to-end IT tax collection system is now fully operational, and there is enhanced functionality of the e-filing platform in administrative courts. Some 70% of cadastral mapping has now been completed, and 100% should be completed by the end of 2023.
We expect Greece to continue to lag most of its peers in the EU in institutional capacity and reform of the public administration and judiciary. There is a risk that over the medium term reforms could be rolled back or, more likely, diluted. However, the need to improve government effectiveness to meet the governance requirements for access to EU recovery funds, and the salutary impact of the February 2023 train accident, which exposed the deficiencies of state management of the rail system, could spur a more rapid improvement.
Political outlook: Election watch Opinion polls in mid-February 2023 showed that support for ND was at about 36%, with the second-largest party in parliament, the left-wing Syriza, at about 28%. Support for the centre-left alliance Pasok-Movement for Change (Pasok-Kinal) was at about 11%. The first polls to be released after the train crash will show the extent of the damage to the reputation of the incumbent and opposition parties. There is now a significant risk that no party will be able to form a stable government after a second election, despite the return of the bonus seat rule, given the political acrimony and likely voter dynamics. The risk of a third election has risen.
Political outlook: International relations Greece has strengthened its commitment to Euro-Atlantic organisations. The US sees Greece as a linchpin of stability in the Balkans, Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean regions, and the two countries are developing a strategic partnership encompassing energy and security. Greece has strongly supported the EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which involves the imposition of far-reaching sanctions.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey had ratcheted up in early 2023. However, a devastating earthquake in Turkey led to a recalibration of relations after Greece was one of the first countries to respond with humanitarian aid. The two countries remain at loggerheads over long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and hydrocarbons exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. Other sources of tension include the refugee crisis in Turkey (stemming from the conflict in Syria), which exposes Greece to waves of migrants seeking to enter the EU. Both countries are members of NATO, which will reduce the chance of tensions escalating into military hostilities.

Economic reforms undertaken since the election in July 2019 of a pro-business government have improved the outlook for the business environment. Owing to progress in several categories, EIU's overall business environment score for Greece rises from 5.77 in the historical period (2018-22) to 6.99 in the forecast period (2023-27), pushing up its global ranking by 19 places, to 36th. Greece remains near the bottom of the regional ranking, at 15th. Greece's heavy reliance on tourism meant that the economy was hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, but it rebounded strongly in 2021-22 despite the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The economic recovery has proved resilient, but high energy prices and inflationary pressures prevented even stronger growth in 2022 and will result in a sharp growth slowdown in 2023.
The improvements are broad-based, but the biggest ones are in foreign trade and exchange controls, policy towards foreign investment, financing, policy towards private enterprise and competition, and market opportunities. Many of these improvements reflect the impact of the government's overhaul of the public administration since 2019 and a new momentum in digitalisation; generous state support for households and business during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine; reforms in the banking system to reduce the high level of non-performing loans; and consistent efforts to attract foreign investment.
Digitalisation and the green transition will spur improvements Greece exited the EU's enhanced surveillance mechanism in August 2022, but the economy will remain under EU scrutiny. Greece's creditors have adopted a more positive attitude towards the country's economic prospects, reflecting the ND government's pro-business legislative agenda. Yet addressing Greece's entrenched structural problems will be challenging. There remains a risk over the medium term that governmental changes could result in reforms being rolled back or diluted.

Business environment outlook: Greece's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: There will most probably be two elections in the first half of 2023, which could disrupt the pro-business New Democracy government's effort to revive privatisation. A newly created "project readiness" unit will start to deliver results.
2025-27: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Cutting bureaucracy will be a focus. Adoption of new incentives, including tax incentives, to encourage foreign investment. A further boost could come from EU recovery fund-related reforms.
2025-27: "Fast-track" legislation, together with inflows of EU funds, could help to drive an investment recovery in strategic sectors such as energy, tourism, transport, communications and healthcare.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: The removal of China's zero-covid policies could bolster the continued recovery in the tourism sector after the pandemic.
2025-27: The risk of Greece leaving the euro zone subsides further as the country's public debt profile improves.
Taxes 2023-24: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base while lowering rates. The government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Efforts are under way to simplify both tax structure and tax filing.
2025-27: Slow progress in cutting corporate tax and value-added tax (VAT) rates. Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing 2023-24: Non-performing loans (NPLs) increase modestly. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for most debtors. Liquidity is likely to remain tight as interest rates remain high.
2025-27: Still-high NPL levels continue to hamper lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market 2023-24: Unemployment picks up again in 2023, before easing back, but remains high by international standards. Some sectors such as shipping and tech may suffer shortages.
2025-27: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for young people, raise employment but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure 2023-24: Energy infrastructure becomes increasingly important as part of the green transition and as Greece aims to become a supply hub for the Balkans. The start of operations at a floating storage and regasification unit in 2023 may spur further investment in infrastructure.
2025-27: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness 2023-24: High-speed internet rollout proceeds at slow pace. Use of electronic payments widens. Digitalisation of the public administration continues.
2025-27: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Greece's score and global ranking for the macroeconomic environment are relatively low, but both improve modestly in the forecast period. The country's large public debt, a legacy of the bailout era of 2010-19, and its significant current-account deficit will continue to hold back improvement in 2023-27. However, Greece has made good progress in many areas in recent years, including in improving the quality of policymaking and the institutional underpinnings for sound macroeconomic policies. Greece's external creditors have praised the government's efforts to keep reform implementation on track, despite the difficult circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
The country exited from an enhanced surveillance regime in mid-2022, but will remain under routine surveillance by its euro zone creditors for many decades to come. Greece will be required to operate tight control of the public finances and undertake structural economic reforms to enhance growth, with the aim of drastically reducing the public debt in coming decades. The stock of public debt was the highest in the euro zone (as a share of GDP) at 195% in 2021, but this is estimated to have fallen by about 20 percentage points in 2022 as a result of strong nominal GDP growth. Waivers introduced after the coronavirus pandemic allowed the government to put in place hefty support packages consisting of deferring tax payments, moratoriums on foreclosures and subsidies. However, Greece is expected to return to a primary surplus of 1.1% in 2023, rising to 2.2% in 2024, to be followed by more gradual increases thereafter until 2060. Meeting these demanding primary surplus targets consistently over a long time horizon will be extremely challenging.
"Grexit" is not an appreciable risk in the medium term The improvement in Greece's macroeconomic and financial position over the past five years or so means that a Greek exit from the euro zone is no longer an appreciable risk in the medium term. Another debt write-down is unlikely, given that most of it is owed to Greece's official creditors, but financial markets have been more positive about Greek sovereign debt. The structure and maturity profile of the country's debt reduce the risks arising from external shocks and increased investor risk aversion, and Greece has a large cash buffer and a manageable short-term repayment schedule.
The main macroeconomic challenge will be adopting and sustaining the policies and reforms that will spur growth and reduce the debt over the medium and long term. The economy presents a mixed picture at the start of 2023, after two years of rapid growth which were in part an automatic rebound from the pandemic-related collapse of 2020. The public sector is still inefficient and the private sector hampered by red tape; demographic trends are not conducive to growth; the labour market requires further reform and unemployment is still in double digits; despite progress, the banking system is still burdened with bad loans; households are indebted, but debtors' primary residences have long been protected from foreclosure (though in a landmark ruling in February 2023 the country's supreme court cleared the legal ground for most foreclosures). If the incoming government in 2023 can maintain the reform momentum of recent years and make good use of large potential EU funds, the prospects for faster catch-up growth and a steady reduction in the public debt will improve.

Privatisation plans are moving ahead after disruption during the pandemic Progress towards liberalisation, enhancing competition and privatising state-owned companies has been uneven, largely because of weak implementation, but we expect improvement during the forecast period. State asset sales brought in only EUR2.9bn in 2011-15, but, according to the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), which is responsible for the country's privatisation programme, the total had increased to EUR9bn in 2011-20. There were a total of 48 privatisations over the course of the decade, bringing in an additional EUR20bn in spillover effects on top of the direct privatisation proceeds.

- The centre-right government that took office following the 2019 election made privatisation a policy priority, but the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 set this process back. Privatisation revenue amounted to a mere EUR54m in 2020, against a target of EUR2.4bn. The government estimates that revenue reached about EUR600m in 2021 and 2022, well below the respective EUR1.8bn and EUR2.2bn targets. The target for 2023 stands at EUR2bn, the bulk of which (75%) pertains to the privatisation of the Egnatia highway, for which a binding offer has been received.

Efforts to promote competition are under way, but face headwinds
- Initial delays in launching the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP)-a sovereign wealth fund whose sole shareholder is the Greek state, of which the HRADF is a subsidiary-have been overcome. Under its strategic plan for the development, restructuring and sale of its assets, HCAP is working to improve corporate governance at the companies it manages. The profits will be used to pay down public debt and boost investment in the economy, but implementation is likely to be protracted.
- In August 2021 a concession to operate the Egnatia highway was awarded to a local construction firm, GEK Terna, and Egis of France. In May 2022 the port of Kavala was awarded to a consortium comprising BlackSummit Financial Group (US) and two local partners for a consideration of EUR33.9m and a further EUR36m of investments. In October 2022 the Igoumenitsa port was awarded to a consortium of Grimaldi (Italy) and a local partner for a consideration of EUR84m. Both transactions are to be concluded following regulatory approval. The northern port of Alexandroupolis attracted two binding bids for a 67% stake in September 2022, but in November the government cancelled the tender, saying that the port was geopolitically and strategically too important to relinquish. It will now remain in state hands. A fourth port, in Heraklion, tendered in 2021 attracted eight expressions of interest. A tender for a fifth port, in Volos, was launched in October 2022. The development of Hellinikon, the site of the former international airport, is progressing; a casino licence, which was a prerequisite, has now been awarded, and the breakdown of development land and assets that will remain public property has been agreed. Shares were transferred in June 2021. Subcontracts were awarded throughout 2022.
- The long-delayed sale of a 66% stake in the Hellenic Gas Transmission System Operator (DESFA, which is 31% owned by HRADF and 35% by Hellenic Petroleum, HELPE) to an international consortium comprising Snam (an Italian infrastructure company; 60%), Enagás (a Spanish energy company; 20%) and Fluxys (a Belgian natural gas transmission operator; 20%) was completed at the end of 2018. The conclusion of the DESFA process unlocked the process for the privatisation of the commercial division of the Public Gas Corporation (DEPA). DEPA has been split into DEPA Infrastructure and DEPA Retail, and Italgas of Italy acquired DEPA Infrastructure for EUR733m in September 2022.
- Laws put in place in 2011 and 2012 abolished restrictive practices in more than 150 professions, but they have not been fully applied. Implementation of the law has in many cases been left to professional groups, which have used their influence to maintain restrictive practices. Legislation has been passed to open network industries, but it is ponderous, and implementation will be slow.

Attracting foreign direct investment is high on the ND government's agenda The ND government has adopted a foreign direct investment (FDI) policy aimed at reversing a process of disinvestment that had been ongoing since 2010. Improving Greece's attractiveness as a location for FDI will be challenging. Persistent deterrents include complex and unevenly enforced legislation, frequent changes in tax laws, and obstructive bureaucracy. The government is scaling up efforts to mitigate these through the digitalisation of procedures, funded in part through the EU's post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Fund.

- The third Economic Adjustment Programme (EAP) in 2015-18 included policies to speed up company registration, "fast-track" investment (by facilitating approvals and relaxing regulation) and simplify export rules. The fast-track legislation covers investments that are deemed to be strategic. Priorities include industry, energy, tourism, transport, communication, health and waste management. The fast-track process provides for approval in one month by the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments (DESE) and facilitation of licensing and permitting applications (against payment of fees) within two months by the Ministry of Development's Enterprise Greece agency. The process did not start out smoothly. By February 2020 only 15 investments had been approved, but a combination of the ND government's pro-business attitude and growing investor appetite resulted in this rising to 50 by February 2023.

Investors will be offered more tax breaks and fewer cash subsidies
- The investment incentives law (which provides for tax breaks and grants to promote regional development) involves the National Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (ETEAN), which has now been recast as the Hellenic Development Bank (HDB). HDB operates in conjunction with commercial banks to provide financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, given Greek banks' high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) and the difficulty facing banks in foreclosure cases, available funding is limited. HDB is supplemented by the development ministry with EU-led community support framework funding, as well as by Information Society, the government's technological consultancy arm. The result has often been confusing for SMEs, which have to invest a substantial amount of time in chasing up funding. The structure of the HDB was leveraged well during the pandemic, however; of the EUR15.3bn it has disbursed in its 20-year history, EUR6.2bn was pandemic-related support funding.
- In October 2019 the ND government passed Law 4635/2019 aimed at alleviating some of the bureaucratic burden in targeted sectors (for example, by simplifying the licensing of 5G mobile telephony antennas). Some of the highlights include speeding up litigation via the introduction of an electronic filing system, the introduction of private-sector auditors for the evaluation of investment plans and curtailing administrative delays in land use approval. In December 2020 5G licences were awarded for EUR372m. In March 2021 the government also mended fences with Eldorado Gold, a Canadian mining company, by signing an amended agreement covering many of the disputes that led to several lawsuits, which the government lost. The move was followed in April 2021 with additional licences and a EUR680m project finance facility from Greek banks in September 2022. Important investments were also announced in 2020 by Microsoft and Pfizer, followed since then by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google, among others. In 2022 the acquisition of a minority stake in a Greek fintech start-up, Viva Wallet, by JP Morgan set a new record with a US$2bn valuation. This was followed by a smaller acquisition of an audio software group, Accusonos, by Facebook's parent, Meta.

The "golden visa" scheme is likely to come under closer scrutiny by the EU
- In April 2013 an "investor ombudsman" service was set up to examine deadlocked investments and remove stumbling blocks. The ombudsman, which is part of Enterprise Greece, is available for investments in excess of EUR2m. Enterprise Greece also runs a "golden visa" programme, which grants investors residence permits when investing in the country. Close to 10,000 of these had been granted at the end of 2022. The bulk of these (63%) were for Chinese nationals, and 600 had been granted to Russian nationals. Following the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing EU sanctions, Russian applications have been put on hold, and the EU has called for a common European framework for such schemes, especially as regards background vetting.

Greece's foreign trade and exchange regime has improved In September 2019 the newly elected ND government abolished the remaining exchange and capital controls that had been put in place in June 2015 to prevent a mass withdrawal of cash from the banking system at the height of the debt crisis. The restrictions contravened the rules of the common currency, but the European Commission deemed them justifiable to maintain the stability of the Greek financial system. Their abolition is one of the main factors behind the significant score improvement for Greece in this category in 2023-27.

- As an EU member, Greece is subject to a common EU foreign trade and exchange policy. Within the EU no tariffs or quotas are permitted, and the bloc has abolished most other non-tariff trade restrictions, such as health regulation that favours domestically produced goods. The EU has a customs union with Turkey; includes Norway and Iceland in the European Economic Area; and has a range of bilateral agreements enabling free trade and other economic exchange with Switzerland. Agriculture is excluded from all of these arrangements. Outside agriculture, trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods. Average unweighted tariffs on these goods from "most-favoured nations" are 4%.
- The EU remains committed to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its dispute arbitration procedures. Despite the change of administration in the US in 2021, efforts to resolve a long-standing appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body have so far failed. This has undermined the effectiveness of the body's arbitration procedures, but Greece has so far been largely unaffected (directly) by the global pick-up in tariffs in recent years.

Efforts to reduce tax evasion will remain a government priority The government has made efforts to improve tax collection by reducing tax evasion and widening the tax base so that high tax rates can be reduced. The ND government, seeking to reverse the upward trend in tax rates over the previous decade, enacted a series of consecutive corporate and real estate tax cuts. After a delay caused by the pandemic, plans to widen the base for property tax by aligning property tax values with market prices resumed in 2022, causing furore at a number of local authorities.

- Further reform of the tax administration will remain a priority but has been painfully slow so far. The Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR) began operating only in 2017 as an autonomous agency, following a series of ineffective reforms. However, with significant technical support from the Commission and the IMF, the IAPR has begun to shift from building its institutional capacity to enhancing its operational capacity and efficiency by adopting modern collection and audit tools, as well as increasing staffing levels. A new salary grid aimed at attracting high-calibre staff was passed in February 2021. Tax collection rose marginally (by 0.3%) in 2019, despite a reduction in rates, but in 2020 and 2021 the government adopted a series of deferrals, waivers and other measures to prevent business failures. This was reversed in 2022, when tax revenue increased by 14.7% compared with 2021 and by 7.4% compared with 2019. More widespread use of electronic payments has also helped to curb tax evasion.

Some tax cuts are under way, but high public debt will limit room for more
- Given the size of the public debt, the overall tax burden is unlikely to be reduced substantially during the forecast period. The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is one of the highest in the EU, at 22% in 2022 (down from 28% in 2019). The system is complex, adding to the administrative burden of compliance, and the burden of taxation on labour remains higher than the EU average.
- Efforts to improve the efficiency of the justice system have had mixed results, which suggests that progress towards reducing the backlog of tax appeal cases is also likely to be slow. Debt management units are being establised in all larger tax offices to concentrate on tax arrears that can be paid through the negotiation of instalment plans. All tax obligations must be settled through bank transfers coupled with tax identification measures; the use of cheques and cash has been abolished to reduce the scope for corruption of inspectors.

The banking sector is focused on NPL reduction Since 2015 Greek banks have made remarkable progress in strengthening their balance sheets by reducing exposure to non-performing assets. Outstanding NPLs in the banking sector fell from EUR118bn in June 2015 to EUR16bn in June 2022. NPLs as a percentage of the total loan portfolio declined from 43.2% to 9.5% over the same period. They fell further to 9.1% in September 2022. Nonetheless, the ratio is still the highest in the EU and far above the euro area average of 2%. The reduction in the NPL stock was achieved through both direct sales of NPL portfolios and securitisations. The latter was used by the four domestic systemically important banks. According to the Bank of Greece (the central bank), by May 2022 they had securitised approximately EUR50bn worth of NPL exposure: Piraeus Bank securitised close to EUR16bn of NPLs, Alpha Bank EUR14bn, Eurobank EUR12bn and National Bank of Greece EUR6bn. The Greek government facilitated the process through a scheme called Hercules, under which it guaranteed securitisation senior tranches. The Hercules scheme was initially approved by the Commission for December 2019 until April 2021, but was later extended until October 2022.

- Greek banks are due to be stress-tested again in 2023, with adverse scenario assumptions including a 1.9% GDP contraction in 2023 followed by a further 4.5% contraction in 2024 and only a marginal recovery of 0.9% in 2025. The results are to be published in July.
- The state's stakes in the systemic banks of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), which is also a subsidiary of HCAP, were as follows in early 2023: Eurobank Ergasias, 1.4%; National Bank of Greece, 40.39%; Alpha Bank, 9%; Piraeus Bank, 27%. In late 2022 Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud, formally expressed interest in acquiring a 20% stake in National Bank of Greece, while European investors were reported to be interested in HFSF's stake in Piraeus Bank.
- There has been considerable improvement in credit and deposit growth in recent years. Aggregate retail deposits increased from EUR116bn in January 2020 to EUR139bn in September 2022. Growth in household deposits is primarily due to increased social spending during the pandemic and a robust economic recovery in 2021-22. Meanwhile, higher retail funding, combined with the release of previously unavailable capital following the balance sheet clean-up, allowed banks to ramp up lending to corporates. Credit activity was also supported by government policies during the pandemic; these included state subsidies and guarantees on corporate loans. The aggregate corporate loan portfolio, adjusted for loan write-offs, revaluations and reclassifications, grew by EUR6.6bn in 2020, EUR1.9bn in 2021 and EUR5.1bn in January-September 2022. However, over the past two years lending to households, which have been reluctant to take on extra risk, has declined. Credit to households shrank by approximately EUR4bn between January 2020 and September 2022, with the bulk of the decline attributable to falling mortgage issuance.
- We expect lending to the private sector to continue to be constrained owing to NPLs during most of the forecast period. Despite the Hercules plan, progress is held back by weak bank profitability, moratoriums on repossessions (although these have started to ease) and a likely new bout of bad loans. A new insolvency framework, intended to address many of the issues that have hindered banks' ability to clean up their balance sheets, may finally become operational in 2023.

Labour market is gradually becoming more flexible, but progress is slow Greece's labour market had long been one of the least flexible in the euro area, but this has been improving gradually, and it is likely to become more flexible in the coming years. Labour market liberalisation, economic recovery, emigration and government support during the coronavirus pandemic have helped to reduce the unemployment rate, which was 11.6% in December 2022, down from a peak of 27.9% in July 2013. Government measures prevented a sharp rise in unemployment during the pandemic-induced lockdowns, and, despite the measures being gradually withdrawn, unemployment has remained on a downward trajectory.

- High youth unemployment has led more than 400,000 young, educated Greeks to seek work abroad. With a labour force of about 4.7m, the negative effect on the labour market is huge. Government efforts to reverse the trend have focused mostly on temporary tax reprieves for those returning, and are neither alleviating the underlying structural deficiencies nor having much traction.
- In February 2019 the government restored a single rate minimum wage and increased the rate to EUR650 per month (14 annual payments). This was increased twice in 2022, by 2% in January and then by an additional 7.7% in May, in response to inflationary pressures. The minimum wage stood, as a result, at EUR713. A further increase is as being considered by the government, reportedly of a similar magnitude to that in May 2022, in advance of the 2023 election.

Statutory pension age has increased, and is likely to rise further
- Primary (pillar one) pensions in the public and private sectors were reformed in 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The private sector is now almost exclusively served by a single fund that came about from the merger of eight smaller ones in 2017. The statutory pension age is 67, with 40 years of contributions necessary to secure a full pension. The minimum pension eligibility age is 62. In 2020 further reforms gave the self-employed greater flexibility in their choice of pension plan and digitised parts of the social-security process. The mounting complexity and specificity of consecutive reforms however, resulted in a backlog of pension applications that was only successfully tackled in 2022. The Ministry of Labour is considering plans for further digitalisation, but this is likely to happen only after elections in 2023.
- The statutory pension age and the minimum pension eligibility ages, of 67 and 62, will be revised every three years, with the next increase being in 2024, in line with life expectancy. In the future pensions will be based on full earnings history, and accrual rates will be reduced so that the replacement ratio will drop from about 80% to 64%.
- According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 test scores (latest available data), 31% of Greek 15-year-olds were "low achievers" in reading and 36% in mathematics, compared with OECD averages of 23% and 24% respectively. Greece participated in the 2022 PISA assessment, but the results, which will also reflect the relative impact of the pandemic on education, have yet to be released. A series of reforms have been passed on the education front, covering vocational training (December 2020), higher education (February 2021) and primary and secondary education (August 2021). A further reform of higher education was undertaken in July 2022, with the aim of improving the skills base.

Major deficiencies in infrastructure will remain The poor quality of Greece's transport and communications networks is holding back the country's international trade and investment potential. Delays to plans to improve infrastructure arise for a variety of reasons, including scarcity of funds; administrative complexity; and political opposition at local and national level. The main gaps include the need to upgrade the rail network; improve interconnections between domestic and international transport links; overhaul the coastal shipping network to improve the accessibility of islands and reduce overreliance on the port of Piraeus; and promote multi-modal freight transport by improving rail connections to Trans-European Transport Network ports such as Thessaloniki.

- A high-profile train crash at a politically sensitive pre-election time in early 2023 may engender the political will to address dysfunction and delay and catalyse change. We expect the government to finalise the modernisation of the signalling and safety system on the railways in 2023.
- A lack of investment means that Greece has lagged well behind most of the rest of the EU in the move to fast broadband, in terms of both the availability of higher speeds and coverage.
- A motorway (Pathe) runs between Athens, the capital, and Thessaloniki, on the east coast of the mainland, and a highway-standard link (Egnatia) runs across the north from the port of Igoumenitsa to the Turkish border. However, nine uplinks from Egnatia to the Balkans remain uncompleted. The tendering of a long-term concession for Egnatia and three of its uplinks received repeated extensions until it was awarded in August 2021 to a local construction firm, GEK Terna, and Egis of France. The financial closing of the privatisation is expected in 2023.
- After long delays and re-routing, the southern portion of the Central Greece motorway is set to be completed in 2023. A northern portion costing EUR442m was agreed in early 2021 and is scheduled to be completed within three years. Auxiliary roadworks connecting central Greece to the Peloponnese without going through Athens were awarded in February 2023.
- In 2017 Germany's Fraport entered a 40-year concession to manage 14 regional airports. It paid EUR1.2bn upfront and will pay an annual flat fee of EUR23m and a portion of operating profits. In 2019 an agreement to extend the concession for Athens International Airport (AIA) for 20 years (from 2026 onwards) to the concessionaire was signed for EUR1.4bn. The state subsequently started a tender to sell HRADF's 30% stake in the airport, but the process stalled during the pandemic. Both companies were compensated by the state to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and HRADF is reported to be considering a listing of AIA through a public offering of its stake.

Greece scores poorly on technological readiness, which measures how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. The country has risen up the ranks owing in part to the ND government's push towards digitalisation.
Greece scores poorly on technological readiness, but has risen up the ranks
- The Inclusive Internet Index (published by Economist Impact, an EIU sister company) ranks Greece 18th out of 100 countries in 2022, up from 38th in 2021. The index ranks countries on four axes: availability, readiness, affordability and relevance. The improvement in 2022 came mainly in the relevance axis, which ranks Greece second globally. It still scores poorly on readiness (48th). The EU's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) ranked Greece 25th out of 27 in 2022. In the UN's E-Government Survey 2022 Greece was ranked 33rd out of 193 countries for e-government development-up from 42nd in 2020. In the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking produced by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), Greece ranked 50th out of 63 countries in 2022.
- In 2017 Greece's telecoms regulator approved a two-year roll-out plan for very-high-bitrate digital subscriber line (VDSL) vectoring technology to improve high-speed internet availability. The plan has faced delays, and the government now hopes to provide internet access of more than 100 Mbps to at least 70% of households by 2023, up from a target of 50% by 2020. Take-up was less than 3% in 2022 but had tripled in two years, spurred by the pandemic. In terms of broadband price, Greece still ranked third from last in the EU.

Economic forecast: Policy trends In the medium term, the main economic policy challenges for the next government will be diversifying economic activity to reduce overdependence on tourism, improving competitiveness and putting the public finances on a stronger footing. In the short term, the government is addressing risks to the economy from surging international energy prices, which the war in Ukraine has exacerbated.
The recent train crash will also demand government attention and resources in the coming months. The government has sought the help of the European Commission in planning its response. The accident will result in more scrutiny of forthcoming privatisations, including the listing of Athens International Airport and the disposal of the state's stake in the Attica Tollway, which could face delays.
The government is implementing a series of structural measures, including making permanent a temporary 3% reduction in social-security payments, the abolition of certain surcharge taxes, an increase in pensions (especially low-end pensions), a pay increase for doctors and a pay review for the public sector.
Greece is eligible for a total of EUR30.5bn (about 18% of GDP) from the EU recovery fund, comprising EUR17.8bn in grants and EUR12.7bn in loans, which is designed to support the member states worst affected by the pandemic. Added to the EU's multiannual financial framework, this means that Greece potentially has access to a total of EUR72bn in EU funds in 2021-27. The impact of this could boost real GDP growth by 2-4 percentage points over the medium term. The government's reform plan focuses on the green and digital transformation and on measures to boost employment, social cohesion and private investment. In late November the EU approved the release of Greece's second tranche of funding from the Recovery and Resilience Facility, amounting to EUR3.5bn.
To support investor confidence, the government maintains a substantial cash buffer, currently worth about EUR35bn, enough to cover the government's financing needs for almost two years. In 2022 the Public Debt Management Agency issued EUR8.3bn in medium- and long-term debt (below a planned issuance of EUR12bn as a result of market volatility). It targets a more modest EUR7bn in borrowing in 2023, though it may additionally issue its first green bond, which was originally planned for 2022. In 2022 the agency completed the early repayment of the remaining EUR1.8bn of Greece's IMF loans and also pre-paid EUR2.7bn in loans from the Greek Loan Facility, due in 2023, with the aim of lowering borrowing costs and improving the country's debt maturity profile.
Financial assistance from the EU recovery fund and support from the European Central Bank (ECB) have helped to contain government borrowing costs in recent years. However, ECB monetary policy tightening has put upward pressure on Greek government borrowing costs, reflecting higher euro zone bond yields more generally. The yield on Greece's ten-year benchmark bond was 4.1% on February 3rd, compared with 1.9% a year earlier. A further increase in risk aversion in global financial markets could cause Greek yields to rise more sharply.

Government debt 174.3 172.4 168.6 164.4 159.7 153.0
EIU estimates that the budget deficit narrowed sharply to 4% of GDP in 2022, reflecting strong nominal GDP growth. We forecast that the deficit will shrink gradually to 0.9% of GDP in 2027, with the primary balance returning to surplus from 2024. Greece's fragile public finances deteriorated sharply in 2020-21 as a result of the economic slump in the first year of the pandemic and huge fiscal stimulus over both years. Some pandemic-relief measures were extended into 2022, and additional support was introduced to mitigate the impact of surging prices on households and businesses. The government will delay tightening fiscal policy until later in 2023, and it will probably do so more gradually than previously assumed because of the increased risks from the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, we expect the public finances to improve during the forecast period, owing to sustained economic growth and the disbursement of grants and loans under the EU recovery fund. Economic recovery, a narrowing deficit and strong nominal GDP growth will help to reduce the public debt/GDP ratio, which we expect to fall to about 153% by end-2027.

Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

Long-term interest rate (av) 3.5 4.4 4.5 4.3 3.9 3.9
The ECB raised its interest rates by another 50 basis points at its most recent monetary policy meeting, on February 2nd. Underlying inflationary pressures in the euro zone underpinned the ECB's decision. Average inflation in the euro zone slowed to 8.5% in January, but core inflation was unchanged at 5.2%-a record high. The bank said that it would continue its tightening cycle at a steady pace, keeping interest rates at levels that were "sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term target". Following a cumulative 300-basis-point increase in policy rates since July 2022, we expect another 100 basis points of increases in 2023 (50 basis points in March and 25 basis points in both May and June), with short-term interest rates settling between 3.5% and 4% by mid-2023. We expect interest rates to remain at this peak level for at least a year (longer than markets are currently expecting), with the first rate cut coming in the third quarter of 2024.
The ECB also confirmed that it would start reducing its balance sheet by EUR15bn a month from March until end-June. In recent years the ECB has absorbed the bulk of new public debt issuance, which has helped to insulate governments from market pressures. The combination of higher interest rates and quantitative tightening will increase sovereign risk premiums, raising financing risks for peripheral economies. The ECB has announced the creation of a new anti-fragmentation tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument, which aims to avoid the widening of yield spreads within the euro zone. The instrument can be used only in cases of acute bond market volatility that are not driven by country-specific fundamentals. Nevertheless, we believe that the ECB would intervene in response to a crisis that endangered the bloc's financial stability (not our core forecast).

Just-released preliminary real GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2022, and revised data for all previous quarters, show real GDP growth at 5.9% in 2022 (the full revised data are not available in our tables). Growth in 2022 was mainly driven by robust private consumption despite higher price inflation, strong fixed investment and stockbuilding, and a continued recovery in the important tourism sector.
We expect annual real GDP growth to slow sharply to 1% in 2023. Disbursements from the EU recovery fund will support growth in 2023, but these will be offset by still-high inflation, potential short-term energy shortages and a slowdown in major euro zone markets. We forecast a pick-up in real GDP growth to 2.6% in 2024 and 3.4% per year in 2025-27 as the energy crisis eases and the broader impact of the war in Ukraine recedes.
A combination of high unemployment, rising prices, high direct and indirect tax rates, heavy household debt relative to disposable income, fiscal tightening, and tight credit conditions will put pressure on private consumption in 2023-27. Following a rebound in 2021-22, driven largely by the release of pent-up demand after the first pandemic-related lockdown in 2020, we expect a slowdown in 2023, reflecting the erosion of households' purchasing power by inflation. We expect growth in private consumption to average 2.6% per year in 2024-27.
Government consumption increased sharply in response to the pandemic and the energy crisis, but contracted by 1.6% in 2022, and we expect more modest rates of negative growth in 2023-25, with spending falling by an annual average of 0.5%. Thereafter, we forecast average annual growth of 1% in 2026-27. Pressure on Greece to tighten fiscal policy will be partly offset by a boost to government spending from the EU recovery fund.
We expect the disbursement of EU recovery funds to continue to support real fixed investment growth in Greece, which we forecast will average about 11% over our forecast period. However, there are downside risks from the energy crisis and monetary tightening, and the recovery will only partly offset the severe depletion of Greece's capital stock during the previous economic crisis.
Tourism, which before the pandemic accounted for about 25% of GDP (including indirect effects) and about half of overall economic growth, was badly affected by pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020-21. Tourism revenue in 2022 surpassed the record of 2019, at EUR15.7bn according to the balance of travel services on the current account. We forecast that annual growth of exports of goods and services will average 6.4% in 2023-27, following lacklustre growth of 4.9% in 2022.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Greece's economy is driven by services, particularly tourism and shipping, and also by the real estate sector (closely related to tourism) and financial services. All of these sectors were badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions put in place to contain it. However, in 2021-22 all of these sectors recovered and performed strongly. Prospects for the next five years are positive, despite some headwinds in 2023. The government is seeking to diversify the economy further to reduce overdependence on tourism by focusing on the development of green and digital industries. Greece's strategic location as a potential energy hub for south-east Europe and its access to significant EU structural and recovery and resilience funds will create opportunities to diversify the country's economic mix, but this will require political commitment and a business environment conducive to investment.
Tourism will be a key driver of growth in services The tourism sector plays a major role in the Greek economy, accounting directly and indirectly for about 25% of GDP. Employment in the sector is about 11.5% of total employment directly and 22% including related sectors. The sector was badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with arrivals slumping to 7.4m in 2020 from 31.3m in 2019. Tourism earnings on the balance of services shrank to EUR4.3bn, or just 2.6% of GDP. A solid, but only partial, recovery was recorded in 2021 as arrivals jumped to 14.7m and earnings to EUR10.5bn, or 5.8% of GDP. Travel receipts increased by 67.9% year on year in 2022, to EUR15.7bn, beating the previous record year of 2019, when receipts totalled EUR15.4bn. The number of visitors remained below 2019 levels in 2022, but receipts were boosted by higher prices. We expect the sector to continue to recover steadily during the forecast period, supported by competitive pricing compared with other destinations in Europe; the release of continued pent-up demand for tourism services after the pandemic, including from China after the ending of zero covid policies; the further extension of the tourism year beyond the summer season; and positive global perceptions of Greece as a leading tourism destination.
Greece's shipping industry employs about 200,000 people and accounts for about 7% of the country's GDP, and has played an important role in driving economic growth in recent years. Earnings from shipping averaged about EUR13bn per year in 2015-21. Greece remains the leading shipping nation in the world, with a total fleet approaching 5,000, representing almost 20% of global deadweight tonnage and almost 60% of the EU's total fleet. Greece accounts for about 30% of the world's tankers, 20% of its bulk tankers, 17% of its chemical and product tankers, 16% of its liquefied natural gas (LNG)/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers and 10% of its container ships. Greek ship owners are expanding and modernising their fleet, with a total of about 200 tankers, carriers, container and cargo ships and other vessels on order for construction in China, Japan and South Korea. The war in Ukraine and the disruption of Russian hydrocarbons supply to Europe has underlined the importance of shipping in the transport of natural gas and has helped to mitigate the impact of the energy crisis. Greek shipping has benefited enormously from the expansion of Piraeus port under Chinese ownership, which has resulted in a major increase in capacity and connectivity, making it the fifth biggest port in Europe. The privatisation of Thessaloniki port has also resulted in an expansion of its capacity, to a lesser degree. Greece is focused on upgrading other ports at Alexandropouli and elsewhere as it seeks to expand its role as a transport and energy hub in southern Europe. One challenge will be to invest in training a future generation of workers for the shipping industry, especially as Greece seeks to lead the green transition in shipping.
The health of the real estate market is closely tied to the tourism sector Real estate activities contracted sharply in real terms in 2020 and recovered modestly in 2021, before rebounding in 2022. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into Greek real estate rose from EUR875m in 2020 to EUR1.18bn in 2021, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). Cross-border investment into real estate remained strong in January-June 2022, totalling EUR788m, up from EUR462m in the corresponding period of 2021. The recovery in the property market was driven by an improved macroeconomic environment and a strong rebound in Greek tourism. However, rising property prices, high inflation and deteriorating real disposable incomes could undermine demand for real estate in 2023. A growth slowdown in the major European economies could also have a negative impact on the tourism sector and depress investment demand for Greek properties. Overall, the real estate sector will face strong headwinds in 2023, but we expect the recovery to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace.
The financial services sector went through a difficult period in the ten years to 2019, suffering from weak profitability, a huge depletion of assets, deleveraging and a major asset quality problem. A rapid balance sheet clean-up in recent years strengthened the Greek banking sector but depressed profitability, which finally recovered in 2022. The sector's growth prospects will be strongly correlated with political stability, continued reform progress and the continued reduction of non-performing loans (NPLs). The latter could rise again if insolvencies increase during harder economic times. Capitalisation of Greek banks remains one of the lowest in Europe and may not be sufficient to cover future spikes in NPLs.

Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised measure) accelerated to an average of 9.3% in 2022, mainly driven by surging global energy prices. We expect it to slow to 4.1% in 2023, reflecting base effects, but price levels will remain much higher than before the Ukraine crisis. With significant slack remaining in the domestic labour market and an easing of global price pressures, we expect inflation to slow further, averaging 1.8% per year in 2024-27.

The euro depreciated sharply against the US dollar in 2022, owing to a more aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) compared with the ECB and the damage to the euro zone's terms of trade from the war in Ukraine via higher energy prices, which pushed the region's current account into deficit. However, the single currency has appreciated markedly against the dollar in recent months as the ECB has accelerated monetary tightening and Europe's economic outlook has brightened. We expect the euro to return to its pre-Ukraine-war exchange rate in the second half of 2023. The currency could depreciate against the dollar again if an energy crisis re-emerges during the 2023/24 winter (not our core forecast), weighing on the region's economy. Over the medium term, the value of the euro will continue to be supported by the euro zone's current-account surplus.

Greece's current-account deficit expanded sharply in 2022, to an estimated 9.9% of GDP, as a large surplus on the services account following a bumper tourism year failed to offset the impact on imports of higher global energy prices and a worsening in the primary and secondary income accounts. The deterioration in the secondary income balance was largely the result of ANFA/SMP profits not being transferred to the Greek government in December 2022 as they were in December 2021. We expect the current-account deficit to shrink to about 7% of GDP in 2023 and an average of 6.7% of GDP in 2024-27 as energy prices remain elevated, domestic demand recovers and the impact of further disbursements of EU recovery funds wanes.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Greece Stocks and flows Greece is a small host of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) compared with other EU countries. Stocks and inflows are well below those of many of the central and east European countries that joined the EU in 2004. FDI outflows have in some years exceeded inflows. Most inflows have been for the acquisition of existing companies either through privatisation sales or joint ventures with local partners. There was significant disinvestment after the sovereign debt crisis, particularly in the retail and banking sectors; according to data from the IMF (based on data by the Bank of Greece, the central bank), the stock of FDI fell from a peak of US$55.1bn (17.5% of GDP) in 2007 to US$25.6bn (10.8% of GDP) in 2014. According to EIU estimates, the FDI stock regained 2007 levels in 2022, when it represented more than 25% of GDP. Greece's FDI stock remains below the levels of new EU member states in the former communist Balkans, such as Romania (an estimated US$138.7bn, about 48% of GDP). Greek companies' FDI stock abroad was US$51.7bn (18.2% of GDP) at end-2011. Much of this outward investment was in the Balkan region, although Greek companies have also looked further afield to invest in North Africa, Turkey and, in a few cases, the US. The outward stock had declined to US$20bn by end-2021, equivalent to 9.3% of GDP, as a result of retrenchment by Greek companies and banks.
Origin and distribution Historically, the US was a major source of FDI for Greece in heavy industries such as refining and chemicals. Since Greece entered the common market, EU countries, particularly Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (because of its status as a financial hub for special-purpose entities-SPEs-created by multinationals for inward and outward FDI), have become the main investors, primarily in financial services and telecommunications, as these sectors have been liberalised. However, since the height of the Greek crisis most foreign firms have sold off their interests in Greece's financial services sector, resulting in net-negative inward FDI stock figures for the sector for ten consecutive years in 2012-21, according to Bank of Greece data. In 2021 Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg accounted for more than 50% of Greece's total inward FDI stock. A number of Chinese transport and logistics companies have made large investments in Greece with a view to creating a gateway into the EU for Chinese manufactures. However, such investments have come under increased scrutiny as a result of the screening regime introduced by the EU in late 2020.
According to the Bank of Greece, in 2021 services accounted for more than 55% of the inward FDI stock, with information and communication services accounting for 29% of the services total, followed by retail and wholesale trade (23%). Manufacturing accounted for 17.8% of the total. Encouraged by government incentives, foreign real estate investment has risen sharply in recent years. Probably reflecting the predominance of small family-owned operations in the tourism industry and of Greek investors, the hotel and restaurant sector FDI stock is modest.
Determinants Factors that have traditionally held back greater levels of inward direct investment include Greece's geographical remoteness from core EU markets; its small domestic market; excessive product and market regulation; underdeveloped transport and communications infrastructure; a reluctance to allow companies in so-called strategic sectors to be majority foreign-owned; widespread red tape and corruption; and an unstable tax regime.
Impact The share of FDI inflows in gross fixed investment in Greece, at 22.8%, is well below the EU average. Increased foreign participation in privatised or part-privatised companies would boost productivity. One example is the purchase of a majority stake in the Piraeus Port Authority by China's Cosco. The investment has turned Piraeus into one of the biggest and fastest-growing ports in the region, opening the way for the site to become a major multimodal transhipment hub in the Mediterranean and the most important sea trade gateway into Europe, potentially bringing significant benefits to the economy. Investment by South Europe Gateway Thessaloniki (SEGT), the German-led consortium that operates the Thessaloniki Port Authority, has helped to increase throughput at Greece's second-largest port.
Potential The pay-off from structural reforms in terms of increased competitiveness will take years to materialise fully, and could be reversed or diluted as a result of political changes. In the medium term the country will offer opportunities for investment in renewable energy and greenfield new technology ventures if red tape continues to be reduced and the reduction in labour costs is maintained. We project average annual FDI inflows of about US$8.6bn in 2023-27 (the forecast period).

Age structure is set to change dramatically over long term According to UN projections, the population will decline by an average of 0.4% per year in 2023-27 (the forecast period). However, life expectancy is increasing, and in 2021 it was estimated to average 81.8 years-just above the EU27 average. The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with the decline in the working-age population and rise in the elderly population (65 years and older) projected to continue. The proportion of people aged over 65 is forecast to rise from an estimated 23% in 2022 to 24.7% in 2027. Population ageing will be a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.
The economic impact of an ageing population will be exacerbated to some degree by the continued decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, which means that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged above 65 to the working-age population) will rise compared with the previous five years. EIU forecasts that the population of people of working age will decrease by an average of 0.6% per year in 2023-27, which is marginally slower than the average rate of decline in 2018-22. The labour force, however, is projected to rise by an average of 0.2% over the forecast period, reversing a decline of 0.3% on average in 2018-22, driven by higher participation rates due to a rise in the effective retirement age and an increase in the number of women in work. The decline in the historical period reflects the impact of the emigration of young, skilled workers leaving Greece to seek employment opportunities elsewhere and the arrival of fewer economic migrants. The labour force participation rate for women is much lower than that for men and is one of the lowest in the EU. The gender gap (the difference between the employment rates of men and women of working age (20-64) in Greece was 20.9 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022 (according to Eurostat), compared with an EU27 average of 10.6 percentage points. In January 2023 the unemployment rate for males was 10%, compared with 18.3% for females. We expect to see a gradual increase in the employment rate for women and a narrowing of the gender gap in unemployment rates over the medium and long term.
According to Eurostat, the foreign-born population of Greece as at January 1st 2021 was 1.36m-equivalent to 12.8% of the total population, with about three-quarters of these being born outside the EU. Migrants from Albania (48%), Georgia (7%) and Russia (5%) make up the main groups by nationality. In 2015 controversial legislation granted Greek citizenship to second-generation immigrants. Prior to the new law, children born to migrants in Greece received a "maternity clinic certificate", not a birth certificate, leaving them without proper legal status. As they were not Greek nationals, they were not entitled to the same rights-such as travelling, working and studying within the EU-as EU citizens.
The migrant influx via Turkey and Greece into Europe in 2015-16 posed big challenges for the authorities. About 800,000 migrants arrived in Greece in 2015, according to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The closure of the western Balkan migrant route in February 2016 led to about 55,000 migrants becoming trapped in Greece. In March 2016 the Turkey-EU joint action plan stemmed the influx into Greece of migrants from Turkey. In 2021 about 17,500 refugees entered Greece via land and sea routes ,and there are estimated to be about 33,000 resident asylum-seekers living in Greece. In 2021 asylum-seekers were mainly from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.
Immigration has become a contentious issue Legislation regarding permanent residence and working rights is in line with EU regulations, allowing non-EU persons legally resident in the country for five years to acquire permanent resident status. Since 2006 all immigration has been linked to employment criteria based on available jobs, and these are posted at consulates abroad. Persons wishing to work in Greece have to acquire a permit through the consulate in their home country before arriving. Persons arriving in the country on student or tourist permits are not allowed to change their status and take employment. Those seeking to establish themselves in Greece as self-employed or as entrepreneurs have had to fulfil detailed criteria demonstrating their relevant experience and supply evidence of having sufficient funds to support themselves so that they do not become dependent on the state. In 2020 the government introduced a 7% flat income-tax rate for ten years for new foreign retirees to Greece. In September 2021 the government passed legislation to introduce a special visa regime and generous tax relief for foreign self-employed digital workers. Such schemes have come under scrutiny and may be challenged under future new EU rules.

Greece is a small, fragmented market of about 10.4m people, about 12% of whom live on its many islands. As a result, distribution has typically been a problem, which is exacerbated when the population is swollen by large numbers of tourists in the high season. In 2019 Greece attracted a record 31m visitors (almost triple the population of the country). The pandemic led to a slump in foreign visitors in 2020-22, but numbers rebounded to 27.8m in 2022, reviving market opportunities and helping to drive overall growth of the Greek economy.
Greece is a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which places tough controls on external borders. Greece has been in the front line of recent mass migration into Europe-mainly from the Middle East and North Africa-that peaked in 2015. Road and rail development should gradually improve access between Greece and its Balkan neighbours in the coming years, enhancing the country's role as a distribution centre for the southern Balkans, as will development of the ports of Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Kavala and Alexandroupolis.
Market opportunities will pick up but consumer spending power constrained Over the forecast period market opportunities in Greece will be constrained by pressures on consumers' spending power. Soaring energy prices, still-high unemployment, high taxes, only a partial recovery in wage levels, tight credit conditions and the need to meet large government primary surplus targets to reduce Greece's huge public debt will make consumers cautious about spending. During the pandemic, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) slumped to US$18,010 in 2020-well below the EU average. This recovered to an estimated US$20,704 in 2022 and is forecast to rise to US$28,167 by 2027. This primarily reflects a projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, following the coronavirus crisis, but also a shrinking population.
The negative spillover effects of the coronavirus crisis in 2020-21 and of the war in Ukraine that began in 2022, mainly in the form of higher inflation and monetary tightening, will reshape market opportunities just as the Greek debt crisis did for a decade after 2010. A return to the rapid pre-crisis (pre-2010) increase in one-person households is unlikely over the medium term, as the number of single people able to afford their own household will not continue to rise. This will have negative follow-through effects on demand in various consumer goods markets, such as white goods, consumer electronics and furniture. Other consumer durables that relied on a buoyant, debt-fuelled economy for sales growth are also likely to suffer, as households will show restraint with regard to big-ticket purchases in the forecast period. Internal migration to the cities will continue, although at a slower rate than before the sovereign debt crisis, as young people abandon farming because of falling EU subsidies and the hope of better employment opportunities in the big cities: Athens (the capital), Thessaloniki and Larissa

Food, beverages and tobacco, together with housing, household fuel, and household goods and services, absorbed just under 50% of consumer expenditure in 2021, which will decline to about 43% in 2027. Demand for housing will fall as a percentage of GDP compared with other items over the forecast period, in line with the broadly stagnant number of households over the next five years. Non-essential spending generally will also be held back by increased saving efforts by the population, as well as debt-reduction moves. Greater spending power among the immigrant community and population ageing will have an important influence on consumption patterns during the forecast period, supporting demand for communication and healthcare services.

EIU forecasts that Greek real GDP growth will average 2.3% per year in 2023-50. We expect annual growth to average 2.6% in 2023-30, slowing to 2.2% in 2031-50. This trajectory reflects the greater negative effect of demographic trends in 2031-50 compared with 2023-30, especially the contraction in the working-age population, which will become more significant as time goes on. Reasonable total factor productivity and capital stock growth will support a continued economic expansion in 2023-50, offsetting the negative contribution of labour to GDP growth from 2030.
Initial conditions: Several factors will hold back potential long-term GDP growth in Greece. The economy has a number of deep structural flaws that will continue to hinder growth in 2023-30 and 2031-50. In particular, a decline of just under 60% in real fixed investment in 2008-21 will undermine the economy's ability to generate growth over the longer term. It also remains to be seen how much permanent damage has been inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic in terms of, for example, labour market scarring. There could be a significant boost to growth potential from EU recovery funds, though our baseline forecast assumes that existing political and institutional shortcomings will hinder the implementation of related reforms. We expect that agricultural products, renewable energy, tourism and shipping will remain the country's principal exports in the long term, but the success of these and other industries will also depend on the restoration of competitiveness to the Greek economy within the euro zone. A marked deterioration in the demographic profile will result in diminishing opportunities to increase labour utilisation.
Demographic trends: The demographic profile will become increasingly unfavourable in 2023-50. The working-age population will decline steadily, despite immigration. Life expectancy is high, reflecting good living conditions and health standards (at least until recently). The birth rate is set to remain below the replacement level; since 2012 the crude death rate has exceeded the crude birth rate every year. The number of people aged 65 and over will increase from an estimated 2.4m in 2022 to 2.6m by 2030 and 3.2m by 2050. The number of people of working age will decline from 6.6m to 6.3m and 4.9m over the same periods.
Transport links to neighbours should improve External conditions: Greece is geographically remote from the EU market, although less so since the EU's expansion to include Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Greece will continue infrastructure projects to improve transport links with the southern Balkan states of Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria (in part subsidised by the EU). Provided that the Balkan region can improve political and economic stability, better transport links with the countries to the north are expected to help to attract some investment from foreign companies wishing to establish a base in south-east Europe from a more established Western market. However, existing EU members are divided on the question of eastward enlargement, which has slowed progress.
Greek and EU relations with Turkey will also influence Greece's long-term economic prospects. Relations between Greece and Turkey had been improving since mid-1999, but took a turn for the worse in 2016-19 over the Cyprus question and again since 2020 over hydrocarbons exploration by Turkey in disputed areas of the Eastern Mediterranean. Relations are set to remain volatile, and we do not expect progress in the dispute over Cyprus. The EU opened membership negotiations with Turkey in October 2005. Some large member states, such as Germany and France, have stalled the talks on technical grounds. A deal over migration between the EU and Turkey in April 2016 was meant to revive the stalled accession negotiation process, but talks have remained in the doldrums. Our forecast is that Turkey will not join the EU as it is currently shaped. Even so, we expect that political tensions will have only a limited impact on broadly positive trade and investment relations between Greece and Turkey.
Political stability will be imperilled by public distrust of all political parties Institutions and policy trends: Greece has a well-established parliamentary democracy. However, the political system is prone to instability owing to government ineffectiveness and the erosion of public trust in the mainstream political parties. A renewed migration surge into Europe along the Balkan route as a result of war and state breakdown in the Middle East could potentially threaten social stability. Institutional effectiveness should improve moderately in 2023-50, but progress is likely to be constrained by pervasive corruption, political patronage and bureaucratic resistance to change.
We expect that red tape will be reduced and that the tax system will become more efficient. Labour law has been changed to ease the hiring and firing of workers and to give priority to labour agreements at the company level. However, we expect that the adoption of structural reforms to boost competitiveness will be inconsistent and will make a difference only over the longer term. Public debt and the cost of supporting an ageing population will remain high, leaving little room for a substantial reduction in the overall burden of taxes and social-security contributions.
Long-term performance: We expect real GDP to grow at 2.6% per year on average in 2023-30 (3.1% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 2.2% (2.7% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 2.9% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. Scope for a further rise in labour force participation rates will be reduced, and we expect a decline in the working-age population. We expect the labour force to shrink by an annual average of 0.03% in 2023-30, and by 0.98% per year in 2031-50, resulting in an annual average fall of 0.71% in 2021-50. Overall, a long-term average real GDP growth rate of 2.3% and of 2.8% per head in 2023-50 will provide for only modest catch-up growth with Germany. Greece's GDP per head at market exchange rates will rise from 42% of Germany's in 2022 to about 47% by 2050.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is predicted to have significant negative effects on the natural ecosystems of Greece and on many important economic sectors over the long term; for example, it will affect biodiversity, species and habitat, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, transport, activities in coastal areas, and the built environment in urban centres, owing mainly to increased temperature, drought, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. According to specific climate change studies pertaining to Greece, the effects will lead to reductions in productivity, capital losses and additional costs arising from damage repair. According to a study by the Bank of Greece (the central bank) in 2011, under an inaction ("business as usual") scenario, Greek GDP could fall by an annual 2% by 2050 and 6% by 2100. It states that the total cumulative cost to the Greek economy could reach about EUR700bn (at constant prices of 2008) by 2100. An updated study was due to be published in 2021, but has yet to be released. According to EIU's long-term economic model, by 2050 climate change will subtract 3.45% from forecast real GDP.
There is thus a clear necessity for the adoption of mitigation and adaptation policies. For example, the tourism and shipping sectors are of vital importance for Greece. The focus is on "Blue Growth", which is a long-term strategy to support integrated sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors. The Mediterranean region, where Greece is situated, is bordered by more than 20 countries, and a large part of the Mediterranean Sea remains outside national jurisdiction. As a result, co-operation on issues such as climate change and the environment is vital in order to manage maritime activities, tackle climate impacts, protect the marine environment and fight pollution in the Mediterranean region.
Greece adopted its first National Climate Change Programme in 1995; the second was adopted in 2002 and revised in 2007 and 2019. All four iterations placed great emphasis on achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by changing the fuel mix to include a higher percentage of natural gas and renewable energy sources; improving energy efficiency and conservation in all sectors; making structural changes in agriculture and transport; reducing emissions in waste management; and expanding research and development efforts. In 2016 Greece adopted the National Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change (ESPKA) through Law 4414/2016, which sets out general objectives, guidelines and means of implementation. According to the strategy, mitigation policies and adaptation should be adopted in all fields, but especially in those of energy, clean technology, industry, biodiversity, agriculture, tourism and transport. The Ministry of Environment and Energy is responsible for identifying potential climate change impacts, planning and co-ordinating adaptation measures and policies, and preparing a national adaptation strategy. The Climate Law approved by parliament in May 2022 contains targets for Greece to cut GHG emissions by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels by 2030 and by 80% by 2040, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. These targets are more ambitious than those set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) published in December 2019, which envisaged GHG emissions cuts of 42% by 2030.
Demographic and productivity headwinds The UN's long-term population projections for Greece, which we use in our long-term growth forecasts, assume a decline in the overall population from an estimated 10.4m in 2022 to 10.1m in 2030 and 9.1m in 2050. Falling fertility rates and continued outward emigration will result in a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. Greece's working-age population is projected to fall from an estimated 6.6m in 2022 to 6.3m in 2030 and 4.9m in 2050; that is a decline of more than 25% over the 2022-50 period. This is one of the steepest declines in the euro area. We forecast an only moderately slower decline in the labour force, of 18%, from 4.7m in 2022 to 3.9m in 2050; this assumes an increase in the labour participation rate in the coming decades as the retirement age is raised and more women enter the labour force.
Such adverse demographic projections would imply a severely negative effect on long-term real GDP growth rates. This is especially worrying given Greece's poor historical track record when it comes to productivity growth. To achieve the average annual long-term real GDP growth rate of 2.3% that we forecast for 2023-50 will require significant improvements in employment, labour participation and productivity growth rates, which Greece has not achieved in recent decades. Over the past 45 years Greece's total factor productivity growth averaged 0.2% per year, and since joining the euro zone in 2001 it has turned negative.
A rebound in investment is likely given the low levels to which it has sunk over the past decade and a potential boost from EU recovery funds, but this positive effect will not persist over decades. Once the capital stock is replenished, the boost to growth will dissipate and the negative effects of poor demographics and productivity will reassert themselves. The emphasis must therefore be on policies to raise employment rates and boost total factor productivity to avert the disaster of negative average growth rates over the long term. However, the empirical evidence suggests that even the most comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at transforming productivity and the labour market may not deliver the sort of pay-off in terms of growth that is needed.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. EIU's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Lacklustre economic activity, slow global trading activity and transitory price pressures that are not sustainable mean that the Bank of Japan (the central bank) will maintain its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance during most of the forecast period, before it considers normalising policy settings. Key indicators Key indicators 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Real GDP growth (%) 1.5 0.9 1.2 0.9 0.8 0.9 Consumer price inflation (av; %) 2.5 1.0 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 Budget balance (% of GDP) -6.3 -5.2 -4.1 -3.8 -3.3 -3.1 Current-account balance (% of GDP) 1.9 2.7 3.2 2.6 2.8 3.0 Commercial banks' prime rate (year‑end; %) 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Exchange rate ¥:US$ (av) 132.2 128.2 115.4 112.8 110.8 108.8 Exchange rate ¥:€ (av) 137.9 127.8 118.3 120.1 124.0 126.2 Country forecast overview: Fact sheet Annual data 2021a Historical averages (%) 2017-21 Population (m) 124.6 Population growth -0.4 GDP (US$ bn; market exchange rate) 4,931b Real GDP growth -0.2 GDP (US$ bn; purchasing power parity) 5,391b Real domestic demand growth -0.3 GDP per head (US$; market exchange rate) 39,573 Inflation 0.3 GDP per head (US$; purchasing power parity) 43,263 Current-account balance (% of GDP) 3.4 Exchange rate (av) ¥:US$ 109.8b FDI inflows (% of GDP) 0.7 a EIU estimates. b Actual.

Full text: - The governing coalition, between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior partner, Komeito, will maintain its dominance during our forecast period (2023-27). Public anger over LDP members' ties with the controversial South Korea-based Unification Church will exert pressure on the prime minister, Kishida Fumio, but will not dislodge the LDP or the prime minister from power. Mr Kishida consolidated his power base within the LDP after leading the party to electoral victories in the lower house (October 2021) and the upper house (July 2022). The LDP-Komeito coalition now enjoys a large majority in both chambers, enabling it to dominate the legislative agenda.
- The security alliance with the US will remain the cornerstone of Japan's foreign policy, and bilateral relations will strengthen. Japan will increase security co-operation with Australia and India. Japan will seek cordial relations with China, aiming to avoid direct conflict to balance its security and economic interests. Ties with South Korea will improve, owing to shared security concerns.
- EIU estimates that real GDP will grow by 1.5% in 2022, and we forecast it to expand by 0.9% in 2023. The high cost of living and weak business investment will continue to constrain private consumption in 2023. The government will maintain its ultra-loose monetary and expansionary fiscal policy. It will also pursue reforms to encourage stronger wage growth, increase productivity and promote digitalisation and clean energy.
- Real GDP will expand by an annual average of 1% in 2024-27. Global trade tensions and demographic factors will impede more rapid expansion. The government will implement structural reforms in areas such as deregulation, corporate governance and renewable energy, but this will remain insufficient to boost medium-term growth.
- Lacklustre economic activity, slow global trading activity and transitory price pressures that are not sustainable mean that the Bank of Japan (the central bank) will maintain its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance during most of the forecast period, before it considers normalising policy settings. The end of the US tightening cycle in early 2023 will relieve depreciatory pressure on the yen against the US dollar.
- Japan will post an annual current-account surplus equivalent to 2.9% of GDP on average in 2023-27. Strong inflows from overseas investment will more than offset a deficit on the services account.

Background: Japan's post-war economic miracle ended in the late 1980s, when a huge asset-price bubble burst, leading to the country's "lost decade" of financial distress and economic stagnation in the 1990s. Economic growth resumed in the 2000s but was then hit hard by the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2011. The population is now shrinking, and the fiscal deficit as a proportion of nominal GDP remains large.
Political structure: Legislative and executive powers are vested in the Diet (parliament), which consists of the House of Councillors (the upper house) and the more powerful House of Representatives (the lower house). The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, were re-elected with an absolute stable majority in the lower-house election held in October 2021. The LDP-led coalition retained a comfortable majority in the upper house after the election in July 2022. Parties that support various forms of constitutional revision now command a two-thirds supermajority in both houses of parliament-the threshold for constitutional reform. This will create new momentum for parliamentary debates that aim to recognise officially the status of the country's Self-Defence Forces.
Policy issues: Gross public debt was equivalent to about 242% of nominal GDP in 2021-the highest ratio in the developed world. The effectiveness of the LDP's economic revival strategy, including expansive fiscal policy and ultra-loose monetary policy, has not been optimal. The Bank of Japan (the central bank) will strive to achieve its 2% target for core inflation (excluding fresh food), but it is unlikely to succeed. As pandemic-related stimulus measures have been phased out, the government has introduced large new packages to alleviate the financial strain on households from the sharply rising cost of living, driven by high energy and commodity prices as a result of the war in Ukraine. These measures will put further pressure on the public finances and preserve the ultra-low interest-rate environment during the forecast period.
Taxation: The standard rate of corporate tax stands at just below 30%. The top effective rate of personal income tax, including local taxes, is 50%. The rate of consumption tax was increased from 8% to 10% in October 2019.
Foreign trade: Merchandise exports totalled US$749.2bn in 2021, and imports stood at US$733.2bn. The goods trade surplus stood at US$15.9bn in that year, down from US$26.6bn in 2020.

Outlook for 2023-27: Political stability Public anger over ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, which is based in South Korea, will remain a source of near-term political pressure but will not dislodge the LDP from power. The prime minister, Kishida Fumio, who led the party to electoral victories in the House of Representatives (the lower house of the Diet, or parliament) in 2021 and the House of Councillors (the upper house) in June 2022, has sufficient support within LDP ranks, and another national election is not due until 2025. With a large majority in both chambers, the LDP, together with its junior coalition partner, Komeito, will have ample space to craft and implement its legislative agenda.
The assassination in July 2022 of Abe Shinzo, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, who had retained considerable power as head of the largest faction in the LDP, has created a power vacuum in the ruling party's conservative wing. Mr Kishida, the head of a relatively small liberal-leaning faction, will take the opportunity to strengthen his authority and promote his agenda, focused on economic reform and defence enhancement. Mr Kishida's decision to hold a state funeral for Mr Abe without public consultation, aimed partly at consolidating support from the late politician's faction, proved divisive and led to a decline in his public approval. The absence of a strong leader heading the LDP's conservative wing will also raise the risk of loyalties being split, thereby weakening party unity and undermining government stability.
The resignation of cabinet ministers in November, due to reasons ranging from ties to the Unification Church to corruption scandals, has further damaged Mr Kishida's standing, but the lack of an acceptable alternative will work in his favour. The broad composition of the cabinet, as well as the government's continuing push for an increased defence budget and constitutional revision, will be vital to retaining the backing of two of the largest conservative party factions: the Seiwakai faction, formerly led by Mr Abe, and the Shikokai faction, headed by another former prime minister, Aso Taro. However, Mr Kishida will refrain from prematurely calling a referendum on constitutional change, because public opinion on the issue remains unclear and failure to win the referendum would deal a fatal blow to his political standing.
Japan's liberal and left-wing opposition parties have been weakened by their successive defeats in parliamentary elections, resulting from a lack of policy reform ideas and low public confidence in their competence to govern. The opposition will not succeed in weakening the LDP's political dominance in our forecast period. One conservative opposition party on the rise, Nippon Ishin no Kai (Ishin), shares many policy preferences with the LDP and holds no ambition to challenge its national rule.
Outlook for 2023-27: Election watch Since the last lower-house election in October 2021, the LDP (together with Komeito) has commanded a comfortable majority and controls the selection process for the chairs of parliamentary standing committees, holding the majority of seats on these committees, which will ease the legislative process.
The seat tally of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party fell significantly in the 2021 vote, while Ishin almost quadrupled its representation, becoming the third-largest party in the lower house. Both developments further weakened the ability of the left-leaning opposition bloc to scrutinise policymaking and obstruct the ruling coalition's legislative programme.
The LDP-Komeito coalition won 76 of the 125 seats contested in the House of Councillors election in July 2022, ensuring a comfortable majority in the 248-member upper house. The next lower-house and upper-house elections are due in October 2025 and July 2025 respectively.
Outlook for 2023-27: International relations Relations with the US, a security ally, will deepen and broaden. Japan joined the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity in May 2022. The government will prioritise freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, given the importance to the country of trade and energy security. It will also work with the US to strengthen supply-chain security for important products such as microchips.
Changes in the global and regional security environment, including worsening ties with Russia, a greater military threat from North Korea and increased Chinese activity in the East and South China Seas, will push Japan to adjust the interpretation of its constitutional right to collective self-defence, with the purpose of shoring up national defence capabilities. Given the strength of the ruling coalition's current majority in parliament, the constitutional amendments (to recognise officially the "armed organisation" status of the Self-Defence Forces and to expand their role in international operations) will probably be put to votes and succeed during our forecast period. Japan will forge closer defence ties (including intelligence sharing) with regional partners, particularly Australia and India.
Japan has imposed economic sanctions on Russia and will stop importing oil from the country. It will diversify its energy and commodity imports away from Russia, which supplied about 9% of Japan's liquefied natural gas imports and 4% of crude oil imports in 2021. This will put strain on bilateral relations and dash Japan's hopes of reclaiming sovereignty over the Northern Territories/Southern Kuril Islands, a chain of islands under Russian control but claimed by Japan.
Bilateral relations with China will remain difficult, with security issues remaining a key obstacle to any improvement in ties. The countries' territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands (known in China as the Diaoyu Islands) will be a perennial issue. China has increased air and maritime activity in the disputed area and fired missiles in August 2022 that landed in waters within Japan's exclusive economic zone, raising the risk of small-scale skirmishes. Japan would be likely to become involved in the event of military conflict across the Taiwan Strait involving the US, as it hosts US troops that would be deployed and would probably provide logistics and intelligence support to the US. This would substantially damage relations with China and risk economic and military conflict between the two sides. While these security tensions will persist, the two countries will also seek to avoid any unnecessarily sharp deterioration in their ties, given deeply intertwined economic interests. Relations could improve moderately in 2023 following a bilateral meeting between Mr Kishida and China's president, Xi Jinping, in November.
Bilateral relations with South Korea will improve under that country's conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol, because of shared regional security concerns. Efforts to settle historical disputes still face stiff domestic opposition on both sides but will probably proceed in small steps. Furthermore, there are still underlying tensions over territorial disputes.
Outlook for 2023-27: Policy trends Amid heightened geopolitical tensions, Japan has shifted its attention towards improving supply-chain resilience and energy security. The Kishida administration will focus on economic security by offering better protection to the country's supply chains and encouraging manufacturing reshoring, particularly in important industries such as microchips and green energy-related products. Deeper business co-operation with counterparts in allied countries will also be facilitated to strengthen supply-chain connectivity and resilience. These efforts will intensify from 2023.
Mr Kishida's proposed "new form of capitalism" initiative calls for a fairer distribution of income in favour of middle-class households and more investment in human capital. This is likely to be implemented in the form of increased minimum wages, targeted tax incentives and subsidies to employers in order to improve in-work training and skills upgrade, rather than raising tax rates on corporate profits or increasing wealth taxes. However, significant salary increases will face strong industrial resistance and are unlikely to happen in 2023, against the prospect of slowing growth and reduced corporate profits. We do not expect much improvement on this front, even in the latter part of the forecast period.
The switch to renewable energy has gained more urgency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We expect the government to ease regulations on clean energy investment and international co-operation and to extend the feed-in tariff scheme for solar power and offshore wind farms. These measures will stimulate innovation and investment in renewable energy, carbon capture and storage technologies, as well as the use of green hydrogen and ammonia. The share of the renewable sector in the power mix will expand over the forecast period. We believe that the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 is unlikely to be achieved without broader use of nuclear power. The government will restart more nuclear reactors to strengthen energy self-sufficiency, although this will face strong local resistance. In August 2022 Mr Kishida announced plans to build new-generation nuclear reactors, paving the way for the country's return to the expansion of nuclear power.
Outlook for 2023-27: Fiscal policy Despite the government's desire to restore fiscal soundness, expansionary fiscal policy will remain necessary to supplement insufficient domestic demand. The supplementary budget approved in November, primarily to support household spending, was very large at ¥29.1trn (US$218bn, or 5.3% of GDP). In fiscal year 2023/24 (April-March) the government will support household income against the rising cost of living and boost private consumption through targeted welfare provision and industrial subsidies designed to encourage domestic travel and spending. Public expenditure will aim to incentivise businesses to promote digitalisation and to invest in research and development, particularly in important industries such as semiconductors and renewable energy. We expect these features to continue in the forecast period.
Heavy social security expenditure and debt-service costs will yield persistent fiscal deficits in 2023-27, but the government will gradually shift its focus to fiscal consolidation through slower expenditure growth. We forecast the deficit to narrow to the equivalent of 3.1% of GDP in 2027, from an estimated 6.3% of GDP in 2022.
Debt-servicing costs will be manageable, despite the increase in public debt from an already very high level, as the interest rate on government debt will remain low by historical standards. Most debt is denominated in the local currency, the yen, and is owned domestically, thus reducing currency risks.
Outlook for 2023-27: Monetary policy We expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ, the central bank) to maintain its ultra-accommodative policy stance-including a negative policy rate, quantitative easing (QE) and yield curve control-in the first half of the forecast period, despite short-term pressure to adjust these settings. The widening interest-rate differential between the US and Japan makes it increasingly challenging to maintain yield curve control and QE without undermining economic growth, while the disinflationary effect of yield curve control and the BOJ's ballooning government bond holdings have also rendered the easing of monetary policy an ineffective tool for boosting inflation in the medium term.
We do not expect the central bank to normalise monetary policy until economic recovery is sustainable and labour market reform is implemented, paving the way for faster wage growth, which would make meeting the 2% inflation target achievable. This means that the anticipated global economic slowdown in 2023 will persuade the BOJ to persist with its current stance. However, the debate over ultra-accommodative monetary policy settings will still intensify ahead of April 2023, when Kuroda Haruhiko's term as BOJ governor ends. When the central bank starts to normalise, pending on core inflation being sustainable at 2%, we expect the sequence of the adjustment to start with a gradual unwinding of QE and yield curve control measures; negative short-term rates will be the last to go.
Outlook for 2023-27: Economic growth We forecast that real GDP will expand at a slower rate of 0.9% in 2023, easing from estimated growth of 1.5% in 2022, as private consumption continues to be weighed down by the inflationary effects of the war in Ukraine. Business investment will remain weak as surging input costs and softening external demand dissuade investment in facilities and building. Export production will continue to face challenges from the supply-chain disruption caused by China's zero-covid policy (particularly in the automotive sector). Component shortages also remain an issue, while demand in Europe is depressed by the surging cost of living. Nevertheless, we expect real GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level in 2023.
Expansion will continue at a modest pace in 2024-27, supported by the yen's competitive exchange rate, stable employment and the push from Mr Kishida's "new form of capitalism" agenda, which advocates faster wage growth. GDP growth will remain inhibited by low immigration, which will exacerbate persistent labour shortages that reflect Japan's shrinking and ageing population. Investment will recover to grow modestly, as the government deploys tax incentives to encourage investment in industrial digitalisation, clean-energy technology and infrastructure.
Outlook for 2023-27: Inflation Consumer prices will increase by an average of 1% in 2023, moderating from an estimated gain of 2.5% in 2022. We forecast global energy and commodity prices to dip in 2023, although they will remain elevated by historical standards. Easing exogenous inflationary pressure, together with weakening domestic consumer demand following an economic slowdown, will calm inflationary pressures. Some businesses will be able to pass on rising input costs partially to consumers. A weak yen, which will increase import costs, will contribute to inflation in the first half of 2023 before dissipating in the second half.
We forecast that consumer prices will increase by an average of 0.8% per year in 2024-27, well below the 2% price stability target set by the central bank. Success in raising private-sector wages-a major factor in reversing the deflationary mindset-is not assured. Wage growth is currently constrained by a large pool of irregular workers and wage negotiations benchmarked on consumer price inflation in the previous year.
Outlook for 2023-27: Exchange rates An end to US monetary policy tightening in early 2023 will help to ease depreciatory pressure on the yen, even as the BOJ maintains its ultra-accommodative settings. After a sharp fall in 2022, when the yen depreciated on average by an estimated 20% against the US dollar in nominal terms, we expect it to recover moderately to reach ¥118.5:US$1 by end-2023, from an estimated ¥137.5:US$1 at end-2022.
We forecast the yen's nominal exchange rate against the US dollar to strengthen further in 2024-27 as US economic growth slows and monetary policy settings turn neutral (in real effective terms, we still expect it to remain weaker than its pre-pandemic level). This will be supported in part by Japan's enduring current-account surplus and modest level of inflation.
Outlook for 2023-27: External sector Japan will continue to post current-account surpluses in 2023-27, owing largely to strong profit repatriation from overseas investments and a recovery in the trade surplus after 2024, as the energy import bill falls. A weak yen (in comparison with historical levels) will support goods exports in 2023-24, although growth in trade volumes will be constrained by increased international competition and waning external demand. The trade surplus will widen gradually in 2025-27 as global demand normalises, supporting Japan's export outlook in the medium term.
The services account will remain in deficit throughout 2023-27, in line with the historical pattern, although the deficit will narrow from its pandemic-era level as the tourism sector recovers. We expect a substantial surplus on the primary income account throughout the forecast period, owing to the large stock of overseas direct and portfolio investment.
Japan will continue to pursue multilateral trade deals. It stands to benefit from a more streamlined flow of trade and logistical procedures through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is Japan's first multilateral trade deal to include China and South Korea. Japan is an influential member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a mega-regional trade deal, and will support its expansion to include the UK but not China.

Full text: - The incumbent centre-right coalition lost the September 2021 parliamentary election and was replaced by a minority coalition of the Labour Party and the agrarian-populist Centre Party, supported by the Socialist Left Party (SV). Despite the SV's aim to bring an end to oil exploration, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia have increased the importance of Norway's hydrocarbons sector to European energy security, which is likely to slow any move away from the oil sector. In the medium term, policies to diversify the economy and accelerate green initiatives remain likely.

- Norway's business environment score improves in the forecast period (2022-26), in response to ongoing reforms and as uncertainty arising from the coronavirus pandemic dissipates. The country's global ranking improves by five places to ninth, with Norway ranked as the fourth most attractive business location in western Europe. A shift to a left-leaning government will drive modest changes to tax and labour market policy. Strengths of the business environment include stable and transparent political and regulatory structures, openness to trade and foreign investment, a low regulatory burden, a skilled labour force and high-quality network infrastructure, backed by the country's substantial oil wealth. Weaker aspects are Norway's small market size, high labour costs and restricted access to some product markets.

Norway--highlights: Economic outlook   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026

- Norwegian GDP rebounded fully in 2021 from the covid-19 downturn, owing in part to a comparatively low infection rate, extensive policy support and the underlying structure of the economy. EIU expects growth to slow in 2022 as private consumption is held back by accelerating inflation and onshore investment is crowded out by the offshore sector. Growth in 2023 will remain firm compared with European peers, although this is largely due to the hydrocarbons sector. Norges Bank (the central bank) will continue its monetary tightening, although this will slow in 2023.

Population growth   0.6 0.7
Working-age population growth   0.3 0.4
Labour force growth   0.9 0.4

- Annual population growth has slowed over the past decade, mainly in response to reduced net immigration, alongside a gradual fall in the "natural increase". In 2021 net migration rebounded from a pandemic-induced multi-decade low in 2020, but it remains below trend. We expect it to return to its pre-pandemic trend in 2022 before gradually declining thereafter. A gradual ageing of the population will continue amid a slowly declining fertility rate and increasing life expectancy. Compared with other Nordic countries, Norway's demography is better suited to future growth, with a higher share of the population of working age. Nevertheless, an ageing population will push up costs in the pension and healthcare systems over the forecast period.

Norway--highlights: Market opportunities   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
GDP (US$ bn at market exchange rates) 480.4 514.1 585.5 627.8 641.9 641.7

Household consumption (US$ bn) 188.1 193.3 222.0 241.6 250.2 256.9
Household consumption per head (US$) 34,730 35,480 40,470 43,710 44,940 45,830

- Market opportunities are constrained by the small size of the population (5.4m in 2021). However, Norwegian households are the ninth-wealthiest in the world, measured by GDP per head in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The consumer goods market is modest in size, similar to those of Denmark and Portugal, and about one-tenth that of the UK. Household consumption per head (at US$34,730 in 2021) is among the highest in western Europe and above all its Nordic peers. Norway's private consumption as a share of GDP is lower than in most west European economies, mainly owing to a large public sector.

Norway--highlights: Long-term outlook   2022-30 2031-50 2022-50
Growth and productivity (% change; annual av)
Growth of real GDP per head 1.3 0.7 0.9
Growth of real GDP 2.0 1.2 1.5
Labour productivity growth 1.6 0.9 1.1

- High labour market participation means that future growth will depend on gains in productivity and investment, both of which will steadily accrue over the forecast period. Diminishing oil and gas reserves will force continued reform of the healthcare and pension systems, with the vast Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) supporting the public finances over this period. Further integration of technology and a steady improvement in the population's skills levels will encourage long-term growth.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously from 1935 to 1965, and dominated until 2001, when a minority coalition of the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals came to power. Labour returned to office in 2005 in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party-the first majority government for two decades. The 2013 election produced a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the far-right Progress Party (FrP), which remained in office after the 2017 vote. The September 2021 election saw a swing in support to left-leaning parties, culminating in a minority coalition agreement between Labour and the Centre Party.
Political structure: There is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system: 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The September 2021 election was dominated by issues of climate change, energy policy and inequality, with the role of Norway's large oil and gas sector expected to come under increasing policy scrutiny, although this will be mitigated in the near term by European energy security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Amid calls for an immediate end to exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf, the consensus view remains to "develop rather than discontinue" the industry. Considering the economy's still-high dependence on the petroleum sector, this is likely to sit alongside policies aimed at further diversifying the mainland economy, accelerating green initiatives, raising the tax burden on the wealthy and strengthening the welfare system. Spending from Norway's huge oil fund will remain within fiscal guidelines.
Taxation: The headline corporation tax rate is 22%, lowered in stages from 27% in 2014. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on costs of exploration for oil and gas. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%, but reduced rates apply widely. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social-security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of all goods export revenue. Amid pandemic-driven fluctuations in trade and capital flows, the current-account surplus narrowed to a 20-year low in 2020, but bounced back to a double-digit share of GDP in 2021 as oil prices rose. We expect double-digit surpluses until 2026.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Norway is a multiparty parliamentary democracy; minority governments are normally supported by one or more parties in opposition. The constitution is the second oldest in the world after the US and provides for a single legislative chamber (Storting; parliament) of 169 members, with elections every four years. Similar to the other Nordic countries, there is a clear left-right divide among the political parties, and the political system has consolidated into blocs of parties with fairly similar views. As in many countries, the political scene has become gradually more fragmented over the past decade, amid more polarised positions on specific issues such as immigration and the environment. Overall, however, domestic politics in Norway remains more collaborative and tends to produce more stable governments than in many other developed countries. This is in part because parliament does not have the right to call an early election, so spikes in instability do not often result in a change of parliamentary arithmetic. Moreover, the Storting uses a committee system for passing legislation, with an emphasis on building cross-party consensus, and only the most contentious policies lead to a parliamentary vote. Extensive powers are devolved to the 11 counties and 356 municipalities (reduced from 19 and 428 respectively since 2020 following an administrative reform). The parliamentary election in September 2021 saw a rise in support for left-leaning parties after eight years of centre-right governments. The election saw a return of the centre-left bloc to government, in the form of a minority coalition of the Labour Party and the populist-agrarian Centre Party, supported by the Socialist Left Party (SV).

Political outlook: Political stability The former ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two smaller centrist parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats-lost the September 2021 general election and was replaced by a centre-left coalition led by the Labour Party. The Conservatives lost significant support compared with their 2017 result, securing 36 seats, down from 45 (out of a total of 169). The party's popularity had ebbed after eight years in power, whereas the Labour Party's emphasis in their election campaign on addressing social inequality resonated with the electorate, particularly following the coronavirus-induced recession. The Labour Party secured 48 seats and leads a minority coalition with the populist-agrarian Centre Party (28 seats).
Despite the lack of a working majority, EIU expects political stability to remain firm by international comparison. This reflects Norway's solid track record of cross-party co-operation and consensus-building, as well as the fact that the Labour Party and the Centre Party are fairly well aligned in terms of policy priorities; these are likely to include addressing social inequality through increasing public investment in education and healthcare, as well as streamlining government services. The Centre Party is likely to press for measures to accelerate decentralisation and bolster infrastructure and incomes in rural areas.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Norway boasts a high-quality governance framework, similar to its Nordic peers. With its long tradition of transparent parliamentary democracy, the country's multiparty structure and consensual style of politics have tended to deliver legislation that is typically passed after broad consultation with opposition parties and interest groups. Elections are free and fair, with universal suffrage, and the transfer of power is peaceful and accepted. Corruption is low, the public administration is competent and the legal framework is stable and non-discriminatory. These factors all underpin an effective political system that is characterised by higher levels of public trust and political legitimacy than in most other countries. This transparent and trusted political framework has almost certainly contributed to Norway faring relatively well (in a regional and global context) in containing the coronavirus pandemic, in terms of health outcomes and the macroeconomic impact, as well as delivering one of the world's highest vaccination rates.
We expect Norway to retain its high score for government effectiveness, and the country's robust institutional structures will remain one of its main strengths. The consensus-driven nature of Norwegian politics can at times lead to sluggish progress in the passage of legislation and implementation of reforms relative to some peer countries, but it is a matter of opinion as to whether this is a positive or a negative feature.
As European integration has proceeded since 2007, the Storting has taken a more strident role in scrutinising European rules transposed into law as part of Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the context of the UK's exit from the EU, there is support in some sections of parliament for a more distant relationship with Europe, particularly within the FrP. However, we view a substantial revision of Norway's relationship with the EU, either for or against future integration, as unlikely.
There is a large amount of devolved power to regional authorities Policymaking is centred in the capital, Oslo, but implementation is largely left to regional authorities, which decentralises the government's functions. The system works well, with sub-national government comprised of municipalities and counties that have equal rights and responsibilities, regardless of their size. Functions are divided between these regional branches. Municipal government supervises junior education, health and social care, and town planning and infrastructure. County government oversees region-wide development and planning, including roads, public transport and adult education. The growing role of digital administration has contributed to a steady reduction in red tape across all aspects of government, and successive governments have attempted to make central and municipal administrations more efficient. However, disparities persist in digital capabilities among different local governments, with more populous regions, such as Oslo, providing more expansive services than rural regions.
A reform of local government was implemented in January 2020, reducing the number of municipalities from 428 to 356 and the number of counties from 19 to 11. The stated aims of the restructuring are to reduce costs, strengthen local democracy, and improve the quality of local services by giving municipalities more autonomy and greater scope to exploit economies of scale. The measure is similar to that implemented by Denmark in 2007, which was broadly effective in streamlining government administration, although the impact on services is more open to interpretation. The reforms destabilise some aspects of regional government and devolve new areas of responsibility, including road networks, broadband development and innovation, to the restructured municipalities. The reform has met with some strong public and political criticism, especially among more rural and isolated communities, amid fears over reduced local influence and a loss of financial autonomy compared with the previous framework. The populist-agrarian Centre Party, the junior partner in the current coalition, could push for revisions to the reform.
Political outlook: Election watch The last general election was held on September 13th 2021. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election before the next poll in September 2025. The political scene is fairly fragmented, with the Labour Party securing the largest share of the vote (only 26.4%) in the last election, followed by the Conservatives (20.4%), the Centre Party (11.6%), the far-right Progress Party (FrP; 11.6%) and the SV (7.6%). Before the election, there had been significant focus on two smaller parties, the left-wing Red Party and the environmentalist Green Party; they polled only 4-5% each, but fared much better than in the 2017 election and collectively increased their parliamentary representation to 11 seats, from just two previously. This could amount to a significant pull towards more green initiatives.
Political outlook: International relations EU relations will remain a significant foreign-policy focus. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contributions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24th has led to most Western economies, including Norway, imposing strict sanctions on Russia on most non-energy commodities, while banning firms from engaging with Russian businesses, banks or key individuals. Norway is particularly critical to the EU's stated ambition to move away from Russian oil and gas imports. Russia has been periodically reducing its gas flows to Europe since the invasion, causing the EU to scramble to find alternative sources of gas. As the next-largest exporter of natural gas to the bloc, Norway has come under pressure to increase supply to make up for Russian gas exports to EU countries dependent on these imports. Equinor, the state-owned energy company, has said that it will work to increase production, although significant bottlenecks in the production process will limit the increase. The Baltic Pipe project, a gas pipeline from Norway to Poland and the Baltic states via Denmark, is expected to come online in October and will cover roughly 60% of Poland's imports from Russia. Norway is also generally a net electricity exporter (much of which is generated by hydropower) to its neighbours, including Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK. However, after a significant drought depleted its reservoirs, the government has proposed suspending electricity exports to its neighbours if water levels remain low, drawing criticism from the affected countries. A full cut-off remains a risk, although it will be dependent on rainfall in the coming months.
As a NATO member sharing a border with Russia, Norway's relations with Russia had deteriorated even before the invasion, with Norway accusing Russia of having orchestrated a cyber-attack on its parliament (particularly targeting the Labour Party). The government responded with a drive to upgrade defence infrastructure in the north of the country. We expect Norway to continue to bolster its defensive capabilities as the war continues.
Relations with the UK following its exit from the EU will also remain a focus of Norway's foreign policy. The UK's withdrawal from the common fisheries policy (which grants fishing fleets access to domestic waters) has been replaced with annual negotiations between the UK and Norwegian governments over fishing access. An agreement was struck in June 2021 and renewed in 2022, giving British farmers market access to Norway in exchange for UK concessions on fisheries.

Norway offers one of the world's most attractive businesses environments Norway's score in EIU's business environment model improves from 7.95 (out of 10) in the historical period (2017-21) to 8.13 in the forecast period (2022-26). The country rises by five places in the global ranking, to ninth, and four places at the regional level to be ranked as the fourth most attractive business location in western Europe. Norway scores reasonably highly in most business environment categories, and modest improvements are expected in financing, the tax regime, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. A slight fall in the score for the macroeconomic environment mainly reflects exogenous factors and is less severe than in most peer countries.
Norway's strengths are stable and transparent political and regulatory environments, resilient macroeconomic conditions, a low regulatory burden, openness to trade and foreign investment, a skilled labour force, good financing options, and high-quality transport and digital infrastructure. The macroeconomic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic was less disruptive than in many regional peers, and Norway's large oil and gas sector means that the country is relatively shielded from negative spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine war. Policy towards foreign investment will remain fairly attractive, with oil and gas investments supported by soaring global demand. The lagged impact of earlier reforms is reflected in the improved score for taxes, amid a modest shift towards indirect taxation. The new left-leaning government aims to target social inequalities by raising taxes on wealth and energy, while easing the labour tax burden on lower-income earners. Given geopolitical developments, there will be limited progress in diversification of the mainland economy. Weaker areas of the business environment mostly relate to Norway's small market size, elevated living and labour costs, restricted access to some product and services markets, skills mismatches and capacity constraints due to labour shortages.

Business environment outlook: Norway's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2022-23: State involvement in the economy remains at a higher level than in pre-pandemic period. Some restricted market access amid relatively high level of state ownership. Low regulatory burden for most firms.
2024-26: No significant privatisation expected State intervention continues to push green and digital goals.
Policy towards foreign investment 2022-23: Generally positive stance towards foreign investment, but inflows constrained by tightened investment-screening regime and regional pushback against inflows from China.
2024-26: Gradual ongoing economic diversification efforts to attract investment across the non-oil mainland economy, such as in information and communication technology (ICT), business services, life sciences and marine sector.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2022-23: Expanded hydrocarbons exports to Europe in the aftermath of Russian invasion of Ukraine. Deteriorating EU-China trade relations likely to hinder (already sluggish) progress towards Norway-China free-trade agreement (FTA).
2024-26: Gradual progress on bilateral trade deals via European Free-Trade Association (EFTA). Changes to European Economic Area (EEA) membership unlikely. US-China trade tensions become entrenched.
Taxes 2022-23: Modest changes under left-leaning government aimed at shifting the tax burden more towards the wealthy and lowering labour tax burden. Major overhaul of petroleum tax regime from 2023. New withholding tax on interest and royalties.
2024-26: Gradual multi-year rise in carbon tax. Possible reforms to generous housing-tax incentives and structure of various wealth-related taxes. Moves to broaden the value-added tax (VAT) base and reduce complexities.
Financing 2022-23: Gradual tightening of financial conditions amid rising interest rates.
2024-26: Growing imbalances in real estate market amid strong house price inflation and structural constraints pose a modest risk to balance-sheet stability and could trigger new macroprudential measures. Further tightening of anti-money laundering rules.
The labour market 2022-23: Skills shortages increases the focus on targeted training and job-search support. Unemployment remains low.
2024-26: Ongoing skills mismatches and labour shortages likely to trigger reforms aimed at raising labour participation of older workers.

The economy is relatively shielded from spillover effects of the war in Ukraine Norway has solid macroeconomic fundamentals that include robust public finances (backed by the Government Pension Fund Global-the vast sovereign wealth fund that invests profits from the dominant oil and gas sector), high average income levels, a large external surplus, substantial corporate and household savings, low unemployment, a resilient financial sector and strong institutional underpinnings. The modest fall in the category score in the forecast period primarily reflects greater exchange-rate volatility, given the weak and uncertain regional (and global) economic outlook amid the Russia-Ukraine war, elevated inflationary pressures and continued supply-side frictions. Despite this, Norway rises slightly in the rankings, mainly owing to the fact that, as the largest energy exporter in Europe, and against a backdrop of high commodity prices, the country is relatively shielded from negative economic spillover effects from the conflict. The government has pledged to increase hydrocarbons exports in an effort to mitigate a deepening energy supply crisis in Europe, but there is limited scope for bringing new capacity online. Norges Bank was the first developed-economy central bank to raise interest rates after the pandemic. Gradual tightening will continue into 2023 (when inflation is expected to begin to soften). Structurally weaker aspects of the macroeconomic environment include elevated private-sector indebtedness, a frothy housing market (with the pandemic accentuating imbalances in the real estate sector), ageing demographics, skilled labour shortages and a significant dependence on the oil and gas sector (with related exposure to fluctuations in world demand and the oil price). Against a global backdrop of rising protectionism, trade tensions, changing environmental perspectives and anticipated slower growth of the sovereign wealth fund, prospects for medium-term growth and strengthening productivity are likely to become more closely tied to economic diversification away from the hydrocarbons sector.

State ownership of strategic assets is higher than in other countries Norway offers a fairly attractive environment for private enterprise, with a low burden of regulation, strong property rights protection, an effective legal system and support for entrepreneurship. However, overall market access is more limited than in most other regional economies, reflecting a comparatively high level of direct state ownership. In common with many peer countries, we do not expect a material improvement in 2022-26, with the category score and regional ranking unchanged. State involvement across the economy has increased (as in most European countries) in response to the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war and will remain at a higher level than in the pre-crisis period, reflecting also a moderate policy shift since late 2021 under the new left-leaning government. The Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA) has proved reasonably effective in its policing of cartels and abuse of market dominance, but its enforcement powers and competition legislation remain weaker than in some peer economies.

- Some 70 companies are directly state-owned, including the largest energy group, Equinor; the largest telecommunications provider, Telenor; the largest financial services institution, DNB; the postal service; and other major businesses in the transport, energy, chemicals, finance, forestry and communications sectors, among others. The eight-year term of the previous centre-right coalition saw limited divestments of state shareholdings, and we expect little privatisation activity under the Labour-led government.
- Owing in part to differing degrees of state ownership across the economy, levels of regulation in services vary considerably by sector. According to the OECD, Norway compares favourably in terms of legal, accounting and rail freight transport services, but has fairly high barriers to competition in insurance, air transport and banking. Although scope for private enterprise in a number of product and services markets is restricted, the bureaucratic burden for companies operating in Norway is generally modest. Administrative processes involved in establishing a new business, payment of taxes, cross-border trading and contract enforcement compare favourably with most peer economies, but there is room for improvement in access to utilities and credit (mostly among small and medium-sized enterprises), and strengthening the insolvency regime (minor business restructuring reforms were introduced during the pandemic).

State involvement has risen since 2020 and will remain a prominent feature
- Most state-backed pandemic-support measures-loan-guarantee and credit-insurance schemes for businesses, a wage-subsidy furlough scheme, tax deferrals and revised petroleum tax rules, and sector-specific direct grants for companies-have now expired, but indirect liquidity support will continue. The war in Ukraine and the related spike in energy costs have prompted new, targeted state-funded support for affected companies and subsidies for households. More broadly, ongoing targeted measures to address the imbalanced fallout from the pandemic and the war; recently tightened foreign investment screening rules; a global drift towards protectionism and "industrial sovereignty"; and the moderate leftward policy shift under the current government imply that state involvement will be a more prominent feature of the business environment than in the pre-pandemic period.

The category score is unchanged, but Norway sees a relative improvement in its global and regional rankings, mostly driven by recent more protectionist policy steps in some EU countries (and elsewhere) towards foreign takeovers and external investment in "strategic" sectors. Given its small economy, Norway has long adopted a broadly welcoming approach to inward investment, albeit with access to certain markets constrained by the relatively high level of state ownership. Mirroring global trends, political and public resistance to foreign influence is on the rise, but specific restrictions on foreign ownership are fairly limited, applying mainly to parts of strategic industries (such as fisheries, maritime and transport) and natural resources. The gradual long-term depletion of offshore hydrocarbon reserves and increasing public consciousness of climate change have given some impetus in recent years to efforts to attract non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI) as a means of diversifying the economy, although this will probably diminish temporarily given the current high-profile role of Norway's energy sector amid the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war. Focus areas for Invest in Norway (the official investment promotion agency) include green energy, "cleantech" (such as battery production and data centres), marine industries, life sciences and a growing professional services sector, especially information and communication technology (ICT). There have been advances, but overall progress on diversification has been modest, with the hydrocarbon sector still among the most appealing to foreign investors. Selective start-up grants and research and development (R&D) support are available, with additional incentives for projects in less populated areas of the country.
National security plays a prominent role in foreign investment decisions
- Norway adopted a new investment screening regime in 2019, giving authorities greater powers to investigate and block foreign acquisitions (from EU and non-EU investors) on the grounds of national security, national financial stability and autonomy. This mainly reflects heightened regional concerns-amplified by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine-at the involvement of state-backed foreign actors in strategic industries and infrastructure assets, as well as the transfer of intellectual property, and is targeted primarily at restricting Russian-and Chinese-backed investments. This regional pushback has implications for Norway, which has long been seeking to finalise a free-trade agreement (FTA) with China, has seen increased involvement by Chinese firms in transport infrastructure projects and has placed greater emphasis on attracting FDI from a more diverse range of countries such as China, other parts of Asia and the US.
- In 2018 a British transport provider, Go-Ahead, won the first competitive tender for Norway's passenger rail operations, covering services in the south of the country for a ten-year period. In 2019 a Swedish operator, SJ, won the rights to an additional seven routes. The previous centre-right government had earmarked a gradual expansion of public-private collaboration in Norwegian infrastructure, including more areas of the rail network around Oslo, but this is now on hold under the new left-leaning coalition. Upon entering office the Labour-led minority government halted further competitive tendering of passenger rail services and track infrastructure operations.
- Foreign and domestic investors receive equal treatment in the awarding of new blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas, based on annual licensing rounds that cover more mature parts of the shelf (awards in predefined areas-APAs) and licensing rounds held every two years for more risky frontier areas. Prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, the growing focus on environmental issues among voters and calls from parts of the Labour Party to reduce tax-related incentives for offshore oil exploration had raised the prospect of a less supportive policy stance for the oil and gas sector. However, the fallout from the conflict will tip the balance towards supporting greater offshore investment over the coming years. On a longer-term basis, however, environment-related pressures and the gradual transition of the Norwegian economy away from oil imply a tightening of rules on exploration and reduced support for foreign investment on the Norwegian continental shelf.

As Norway is a net energy exporter with a small domestic market and limited manufacturing capacity, successive governments have adopted broadly pro-free-trade policies, despite a longstanding reluctance to join the EU and the protectionism afforded to home-produced agriculture. The category score is unchanged in the forecast period, with limited progress expected in diversifying Norway's export base. Global trading conditions will be challenging, amid increasing regionalism, ongoing supply-chain disruption (from the pandemic and war in Ukraine) and worsening trade tensions between the world's major economies (particularly US and EU relations with China). Norway's institutions are largely welcoming to foreign trade. Profits and dividends earned in all sectors may be repatriated, with no restrictions on capital flows. Through the country's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), domestic and foreign-owned companies in Norway have full access to the single market, which accounts for about 60% of Norwegian exports. EU access provides for free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between Norway and member states. Norway has adopted about three-quarters of single-market legislation, with notable exceptions around fisheries and agriculture (the fisheries industry is among the largest in Europe). Trading outside the EU is promoted mainly through FTAs concluded by the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA), which comprises Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. As at August 2022 there were 29 FTAs covering 41 countries, with talks ongoing over future deals with India, Malaysia, Thailand and Mercosur (the South American trading bloc), among others. A Norway-UK FTA took effect from December 2021 with little material change from the EU-based arrangement, introducing duty-free status for some important Norwegian exports but also more red tape in some areas. Annual negotiations between the two governments now dictate the terms of fishing access in domestic waters. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Norway joined most Western countries in imposing sanctions on Russia and banning firms from engaging with Russian businesses, banks or key individuals.
Norway is unlikely to renegotiate the terms of its EEA membership
- Norway's position on the fringe of European institutions is unlikely to change. It is not a member of the EU and will not consider joining in the forecast period, amid strong opposition from a number of political parties and mixed support from voters. There have been calls in recent years by the Centre Party and the far-right Progress Party to renegotiate the terms of Norway's EEA membership, but this remains unlikely, with a majority in parliament supportive of the existing arrangement and in view of the UK's tortuous Brexit process.
- The substantial boost to hydrocarbons export revenue since the Russia-Ukraine war will bolster near-term investment in the oil and gas sector. Direct exposure of the economy to trade with Russia is low, but export-focused businesses will be affected indirectly through increased logistical upheaval and transport costs, elevated energy and raw materials prices, and scarcity of some inputs. These factors will hinder Norway's efforts to strengthen the mainland economy. The war, along with the pandemic, will exacerbate existing geopolitical trends such as rising protectionism and may spur more regionalised nearshoring of supply chains, although Asia (primarily China) will remain a key source of many import components.
- Negotiations on a bilateral Norway-China FTA have been ongoing since 2008. Both countries will continue to adopt a pragmatic view with regard to strengthening trade ties, but against the backdrop of heightened EU-China tensions-fuelled by disputes over competition, strategic sectors, human rights issues and China's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war-it is highly unlikely that a Norway-China FTA will be concluded in the forecast period. We expect a deterioration in EU-China diplomatic ties in 2022-26. Trade will continue, but the operating environment for Western firms dealing with China will worsen, amid an increasing compliance burden of disruptive regulations.

Recent reforms have involved a shift from direct to indirect taxation The tax regime is one of the weaker aspects of the business environment, notwithstanding reforms in recent years that have improved Norway's global and regional standing. Reforms have aimed at encouraging labour participation and private investment via shifting some of the overall tax burden from direct to indirect taxation. This has included cuts to personal and corporate income tax rates, levies on some financial activities and high-sugar products, changes in excise duties, and a rise in the carbon tax. Norway's tax/GDP ratio has been fairly stable over recent years at about 40%-slightly below the EU average and its Nordic peers. The shares of total tax receipts from personal and corporate income taxes, and value-added tax (VAT), are all above the EU average, whereas social security contributions and revenue from taxes on property, energy and non-VAT indirect taxes each account for a below-average share.

- Since 2019 the headline corporation tax rate has been 22%, close to effective tax rates among regional peers and the OECD average. Additional corporate income tax rates (from 2022) are levied on offshore petroleum firms (56%) and hydropower production (37%). These have trended moderately higher, but effective tax rates have been largely stable, as the tax rate of investment-based depreciation-the "rate of uplift"- has been gradually lowered. Temporary changes to elements of the petroleum tax system (covering depreciation, uplift and treatment of tax losses) were applied in 2020-21 amid the pandemic disruption to encourage new investments. An overhaul of the petroleum tax regime will take effect from 2023, with a shift to a more cashflow-oriented system. This will also reduce the tax allowance for investments and phase out uplifts, but expand deductions and refunds, aiming to improve the "neutrality" of the overall regime and liquidity conditions for oil-sector companies.
- Since 2016 the income tax system for individuals has comprised a progressive four-tier framework. Recent reforms have included a reduction in the flat tax rate on net income, from 27% to the current 22%, increases in the personal allowance, some reductions in wealth-related taxes and a tightening of various exemptions. As at 2022 additional income tax rates ranged from 1.7% to 16.4%. VAT is levied at a standard rate of 25%, although reduced rates of 15%, 12% and 0% apply to a wide range of goods and services.
- Norway compares well in global terms on most measures of income and wealth equality, but imbalances have steadily widened, with rising inequality a prominent issue in the 2021 election. A new withholding tax of 15% on interest and royalty payments was introduced in mid-2021. More recent changes have mostly comprised temporary measures to ease the energy-price shock. The new government will prioritise increased progressivity, via (moderate) tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and higher taxes levied on the wealthy and some businesses. Phased increases in the already relatively high and broad-based carbon tax are also expected, as is further implementation of corporate tax avoidance provisions under the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Broadening the VAT base and limiting the extremely generous housing-related tax incentives are also possible.

The financing environment is sound, but some risks to stability will pesist Financing conditions for business will remain favourable, with Norway retaining elevated global and regional rankings. This reflects the underlying resilience of the banking sector, comparatively modest risk exposure, and the impact of earlier improvements to the regulatory framework. Annual stress tests prior to the pandemic and since show that the banking sector is more profitable than most regional peers, with strong capital and liquidity buffers, comparatively modest costs, and low levels of credit losses and non-performing loans. Banks remain more reliant on wholesale funding than in many peer economies, reflecting the limited scope to expand the deposit base. This implies liquidity risk via exposure to global market trends, although the maturity of this funding has lengthened in recent years. Since 2018 revelations of several major money-laundering scandals involving major Nordic-Baltic banking groups have prompted a significant tightening of previously lax anti-money laundering and terrorism financing legislation across the region, and further measures are likely.

- Risks to financial instability remain fairly low, but a backdrop of steadily tightening financial conditions, elevated inflation, the winding down of liquidity-support measures from the pandemic, volatile international capital markets, an overvalued real-estate sector, and spillover risk from war-related disruption to business and a recession across the EU economy could expose vulnerabilities in the tightly integrated Nordic-Baltic banking system.
- Prior to the pandemic, new macroprudential measures were introduced to strengthen bank capital buffers and tighten rules on consumer credit and higher-risk mortgage lending. These dampened growth in real estate prices and mortgage lending temporarily, but house price inflation accelerated strongly during the pandemic (as in many countries), amid rising household savings and expansionary monetary policy. Structural factors such as generous mortgage-interest deductibility tax rules and limited new housing supply (given tight planning regulations) also underpin house price growth. Rising policy interest rates and gradual normalisation of other policy tools will dampen housing market activity, but new macroprudential measures could be needed.
- Foreign companies have access to the same capital sources as domestic firms, but often work through foreign banks, which tend to have offices in Oslo and in cities where the oil industry is based, especially Bergen and Stavanger. Demand for (and supply of) venture capital and private equity has strengthened over recent years, and we expect a further expansion.

A tight labour market and the risk of skills mismatches will persist Norway's score for the labour market over the forecast period remains around the regional average. The labour force is productive and highly educated, with a strong level of technical and language skills. An employment rate of about 75% is above the EU and OECD averages, but trails regional peers. This implies some scope for raising participation, growth of which is partly constrained by the effects of a generous sick leave system and above-average early retirement take-up amid a gradually ageing population. There is a high level of unionisation and a highly centralised system of collective bargaining between government, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. This involves a high degree of co-ordination, with manufacturing wages providing a benchmark for sector-specific and company-level bargaining. Median wage levels are elevated and earnings inequality fairly low, but regional and sectoral variations have been intensified by the pandemic. The cost of living is among the highest in the world. Industrial actions have been part of the wage-bargaining process in recent years, particularly in the large public sector and offshore petroleum industry. However, the government reserves the right to enforce arbitration in disputes that are likely to have a major impact on the economy or be detrimental to public health.

- A temporary state-backed wage-subsidy scheme limited job losses during the pandemic. Headline indicators have since recovered strongly, with unemployment in mid-2022 at a 14-year low and a growing number of skilled labour market shortages and skills mismatches, (although these trends were on the rise even before the pandemic). This is exacerbated in part by reduced inflows of foreign labour, which remain below 2019 levels. An influx of refugees from the conflict in Ukraine (Norway has signalled that it will take about 45,000) will provide only a partial boost to the labour supply. A stated aim of the new government is to strengthen workers' rights (by advocating full-time jobs and permanent employment contracts over temporary forms of work) and incentivise job creation for young and migrant workers. Given Norway's labour-supply issues and demographic trends, measures are likely to focus on bolstering labour participation among older workers.
- A relative lack of labour mobility will continue to restrict opportunities for development in remote regions, and a mismatch of education and skills among immigrants and asylum-seekers settling in Norway will hamper integration into the workforce. Political pressure to restrict immigration will remain high.

Infrastructure planning is set out on a decade-long time horizon Norway has well-developed transport networks and high-quality digital infrastructure, with few of the problems, such as traffic congestion, that affect countries with higher population densities. Gradual improvements to road and rail networks are scheduled over the forecast period, based on an updated ten-year national transport plan published in early 2022. The new government will roll back elements of the previous government's plans for stronger public-private co-operation on infrastructure projects. Road tolls are an important source (about 10%) of infrastructure funding, although they are politically unpopular. Norway is a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with an extensive charging network. Good ferry and internal air transport services, including oil-rig helicopter links, mitigate the logistical challenges posed by the country's diverse topography and weather-related vulnerabilities. Digital infrastructure is among the most advanced in the world, with Norway ranking among the leading countries in the European Commission's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). Provision and uptake of high-speed broadband services, online business use and level of e-government services compare favourably with regional peers.

- Infrastructure policy is guided by a 12-year national transport plan (updated every four years), which focuses on maintenance and upgrading of transport infrastructure, pollution reduction, rolling out intelligent transport systems and ongoing digitisation. The baseline scenario of the updated plan for 2022-33 allocates 47% of an overall financial framework of Nkr1.2bn (US$116m) for road improvements; 33% for railways (which includes new double-track lines for intercity routes, Oslo-Skien and Halden-Lillehammer, and a second light-rail line in Bergen); 7% for other green urban transport measures; and 3% to coastal infrastructure schemes to benefit the fishing and shipping industries. The government has set a target for all new passenger cars and light vans to be zero-emission from 2025 and for transport sector emissions to be cut by 50% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.
- A relatively early schedule of auctions for 5G-compatible spectrum provided momentum for Norway's fifth-generation (5G) network rollout, although deployment remains largely limited to major cities. Telenor launched Norway's first commercial 5G mobile services in March 2020, with its main competitor, Telia, debuting its 5G network soon after. The operators are targeting nationwide coverage from 2023. A Broadband Development Act, adopted in 2020, aims to facilitate the development of ultrafast broadband networks and 5G by encouraging co-operation in infrastructure construction and promoting joint utilisation of existing networks. In March 2022 the government distributed Nkr304m (US$29m) to local governments to develop regional broadband networks, aiming for a nationwide gigabit-capable fast-broadband network by 2025.

We expect gradual improvements in technological readiness over 2022-26, but little change to Norway's rankings. Stronger aspects are the quality of digital infrastructure, high rates of e-commerce and e-business technology, good penetration of e-government services, widespread internet usage, above-average digital skills levels, and good cyber-security preparedness (which has recently been bolstered). Total investment in R&D corresponds to just over 2% of GDP-slightly below an OECD average of 2.4% and well below levels of more than 3% in Denmark and Sweden. Norway ranks in the second-highest group in the European Innovation Scoreboard, scoring well for its innovation-friendly environment, strong public-private linkages and lifelong learning. Weaker aspects include impact from sales and exports of knowledge-intensive products, implying scope for improvement in translating the country's innovative capacity into entrepreneurial activity.

- As one of the world's most digitised economies, with tense relations (and a direct border) with Russia, state-sponsored cybercrime and cyber-espionage pose a clear threat to Norwegian companies and public authorities, particularly in light of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Norway adopted a revised national cyber-security strategy in 2019, but this failed to prevent several major cyber-attacks (widely believed to be by Russian and Chinese state-sponsored actors) in 2021, since when Norway has taken steps to bolster its cyber-resilience and strengthen regional security co-operation. According to the Global Cyber-security Index 2020, published by the International Telecommunication Union, Norway ranked 17th globally for its commitment and capacity to deal with cyber-related attacks.

There will be a focus on strengthening digital skills and e-government
- Recent budgets have earmarked new funding for the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to strengthen various digital platforms used by the public. Norway ranks highly for use and integration of digital technology by government and businesses, but the accelerated paradigm shift towards digitisation amid the pandemic implies ongoing pressures to meet rising demand. A focus of the new government's digital strategy is to bolster digital skills levels and expand the available stock of higher-skilled ICT workers.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The coalition's long-term policy priorities include long-running efforts to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons, particularly towards fishing, professional services and light manufacturing. The government is also likely to pursue efforts to increase spending on healthcare and education, accelerate progress on green initiatives, and incentivise job creation (particularly in industries affected by skills shortages). However, in the short term the hydrocarbons sector will increase in importance: with the withdrawal of Russian gas, Norway now provides more than 25% of Europe's gas supply. As a result, the government is likely to focus on reliability of supply in the short term. In the longer term the move towards decarbonisation is likely to exacerbate divisions within the Labour Party between its youth and trade union wings over oil reimbursement allowances (which allow 70% of oil exploration costs to be reimbursed if there is no discovery), which threaten to remove the tax incentives for investment in offshore oil. However, given the imperative of providing for European energy security, any change is unlikely during this parliamentary term.
Although inflation is far lower in Norway than in other European countries owing to its status as an energy producer and net exporter, the government is likely to provide additional support for households struggling with higher prices. High profits in the energy sector, along with tight labour markets and increasing cost-of-living concerns, have led to labour unrest, with Lederne, the trade union for the crude oil industry in Norway, staging a series of work stoppages between July 6th and 9th. The government implemented a compulsory arbitration proceeding, effectively ending the strike. However, high energy sector profits, tight labour markets and escalating inflation make labour unrest an ongoing risk.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

General government debt 43.2 35.8 31.3 28.6 26.1 25.3
Fiscal conditions are supported by the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the country's US$1trn sovereign wealth fund, which has insulated the public finances from cyclical fluctuations. Owing to its long history of fiscal probity, Norway has a greater level of fiscal space than most, meaning that it remains in a strong position to increase stimulus again in 2022 if high inflation requires increased support to households, without placing any pressure on public debt, which remains low.
After a deficit of 2.6% of GDP in 2020, the first since 1993, strong revenue growth, particularly in the oil and gas sector, returned the budget to a surplus of 9.9% of GDP in 2021. EIU expects the surplus to remain elevated in 2022, at 11.3%, with higher energy prices more than offsetting increased social support amid accelerating inflation and higher social spending under the new government. Norway typically runs a significant fiscal surplus, near 10% of GDP, in periods of high oil prices, and we expect this to resume in 2023-24. A combination of falling hydrocarbons prices as new global supply comes online and reasonably firm expenditure growth in the second half of the forecast period is likely to erode the surplus slightly, to 8.7% by the end of the forecast period.

10-year government bond yield (av) 1.3 2.0 3.4 4.3 4.8 5.0
Norges Bank (the central bank) began tightening monetary policy in September 2021, lifting the policy rate (which had been at a record low of 0% since May 2020) by 25 basis points. It raised the policy rate by 25 basis points again in both December 2021 and March 2022, followed by 50-basis-point increases in June and August, bringing the rate to 1.75%, as inflation continued to accelerate owing to higher import costs. Further gradual tightening is likely in the remainder of 2022. However, the trajectory of future rate rises is likely to moderate in 2023 in order to avoid choking off economic growth altogether. Norges Bank's inflation target of close to 2% over time means that there is some latitude for the central bank to raise rates fairly gradually, even as inflation remains elevated. Moreover, much of the acceleration in inflation stems from higher energy prices and supply-chain disruption for manufactured goods, which will be unaffected by central bank tightening. As a result, we expect the policy rate to stabilise at about 3.5% by the end of 2023.

Full-year real GDP growth was strong in 2021, at 4%. An increase in new covid-19 cases in December 2021 and the implementation of new restrictions in January, along with the corresponding weakening of consumer confidence, led to a quarterly contraction of 0.9% in the first quarter of 2022. Growth returned in the second quarter, at 0.7%, with private consumption fully rebounding, but weak investment holding back overall GDP growth. We expect that over the full year real GDP growth will slow somewhat to 2.3%, with the quarterly pattern of activity of individual GDP components likely to be volatile, reflecting instability in global markets following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Private consumption will rebound strongly, although much of this is due to base effects from the lockdown-depressed 2021 base year, whereas the government's withdrawal of coronavirus-related stimulus will prompt much slower public consumption growth. Fixed investment will remain volatile, as increased investment in the offshore (oil and gas) economy will be partly offset by the ongoing weak performance of the non-energy sector amid higher interest rates and crowding out by offshore investment. Increasing oil and gas export volumes will support growth. However, a rebound in imports following the lifting of covid-related travel restrictions in the tourism sector will limit the contribution of the external sector to overall growth.
In contrast to most of Europe, where growth is expected to slow, Norwegian growth will remain slightly above trend in 2023, at 2.8%, reflecting increased export values from the hydrocarbons sector and a modest increase in hydrocarbons production, as well as base effects from the covid restrictions in the first quarter of 2022. These will offset weak private consumption growth, which will be hampered by high inflation (which will erode real incomes). From 2024-26 the economy is still forecast to grow relatively firmly-at an annual average of 2.4%, roughly in line with the pre-pandemic trend-assuming growth in both the energy and non-oil sectors (with the former slowing towards the end of the forecast period as energy prices decline gradually and Europe's energy transition gathers pace). Exports will remain firm, which will help to support a fairly strong pace of overall growth in the medium term. In the hydrocarbons sector, a temporary tax break in 2020, resilient sectoral investment and exploration activity during the pandemic indicate that new capacity will come on-stream over the forecast period, offsetting reduced output from ageing fields. This revival in offshore activity is likely to raise production to a 15-year high by 2024-26, although it will remain below the peak reached in the early 2000s.
In the context of growing concerns about the reliability of Russian gas supplies to Europe, Norway's gas exports are expected to rise over the forecast period, as they represent a secure and stable source of supply for European gas-importing economies. However, capacity issues will limit the pace of gas export growth. In the longer term the broader role of the oil and gas sector in the Norwegian economy faces growing scrutiny amid climate change, societal shifts, "net zero" emissions targets and the gradual diversification of global energy demand away from oil and gas. Towards the end of the forecast period, this could hamper investment growth and (beyond the forecast period) affect exports more significantly.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In common with most advanced economies, the majority of the Norwegian economy is derived from services, at 64% in 2021. However, this figure is lower than Norway's neighbours (with Denmark at 76% and Sweden at 66%), highlighting the importance of natural resource extraction, particularly in the hydrocarbons sector, to the Norwegian economy. Industry accounts for 34% of the economy, with agriculture making up the remaining 2%. Services have generally risen as a share of GDP over recent decades, although they remain below their all-time high of 65% in 2019 owing to the pandemic. Within the industrial sector, the manufacturing industry comprises a fairly modest 7% share of GDP, similar in scale to the construction sector, although the latter is on a gradually rising trend.
The oil and gas sector has been the primary driver of economic development since Norwegian oil was first exploited in the 1970s. The influence of the oil and gas sector (as a share of GDP) has declined steadily in recent decades, from about 30% in the early 2000s, amid growth of the services sector, volatile oil prices, disrupted production on major (and in some cases ageing) oil platforms and shifting environmental pressures.
A 2020 tax credit and surging demand will boost oil production in 2022-26 After falls in output in 2018-19, oil and gas production rose in 2020 despite the pandemic, supported by a temporary tax break in mid-2020 that encouraged new exploration, and increased further in 2021 and 2022 following rising hydrocarbons prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As at end-2021 a total of 94 fields were producing, up from 83 in 2018, with four new fields beginning production in 2021 alone. Early phases of exploration took place in the North Sea (on the country's south-west coast, with 71 platforms currently operating), but later efforts have also concentrated on the Norwegian Sea (on the north-west coast, with 21 platforms) and the Barents Sea (further north, two platforms).
The exploration of new fields is likely to offset declining production in ageing fields, which will raise production to a decade-high level by 2024-25 (although this will remain below the peak in the early 2000s). Official forecasts from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), a government agency, point to continued growth in output to 2024-25, before tapering off thereafter, with gas continuing to grow through 2026. This is partly attributable to the reactivation of several oil platforms after maintenance operations, but the main factor behind the jump in production is the giant Johan Sverdrup field, which came on stream in late 2019. It is the fifth-largest oil discovery ever made in Norwegian waters and will account for 30% of all Norwegian oil production by the mid-2020s, according to the NPD.
In the short-term Norway will be under pressure to increase production further given sanctions on Russia and the corresponding energy crisis in Europe. In the longer term, however, the broader role of the oil and gas sector in the Norwegian economy faces growing scrutiny amid greater public and societal commitment to moving towards "net zero" emissions targets and diversifying the economy. Climate and environmental issues dominated Norway's 2021 election campaign, with a majority left-leaning coalition coming to power on a platform of more aggressive emisisons reduction. Most political parties and the public remain broadly aligned in the view that the focus should be to "develop rather than discontinue" the industry, given the economy's still high dependence on petroleum sector revenue, which has only been reinforced by the energy crisis. The longer-term direction of travel is clear, however, with the influence of the sector on the Norwegian economy set to decline gradually from the mid-2020s as the energy transition continues.
Non-oil manufacturing has declined over the past decade Since the exploitation of oil, Norway's manufacturing sector has diminished in economic importance, from an 18% share of GDP in 1970 to about 7% in 2021. The trend over the past decade has been one of gradual decline, from just below 8% in the late 2000s. Manufacturing is split between an oil-oriented component dominated by machinery, chemicals and ship-building, and a consumer-oriented component, of which the largest is production of food and beverages. The sector is highly capital intensive, with activity having rebounded since mid-2020 more quickly than most services sectors, amid a recovery in global trade and being less exposed to pandemic-related restrictions. Momentum slowed over the first half of 2021, hampered in part by supply-chain disruptions such as the global semiconductor chip shortage and rising freight costs, which have led to soaring producer price inflation that will persist into 2023. Non-oil manufacturing may receive targeted support in the coming years as part of a broader economic diversification strategy. The link between the krone and global oil prices will, however, continue to pose a challenge to efforts to boost the global share of manufacturing exports.
In the services sector, government and public administration account for the largest share of activity and employment, reflecting in part high-quality and extensive healthcare, education and social welfare structures. Wholesale and retail trade, business services, financial services, real estate, and information and communications technology (ICT) all make a sizeable contribution to services value added. Much of the sector services the internal market, but there are many service industries that have developed a significant advantage compared with their European and global competitors. Given Norway's geographical location and the influence of the oil and gas industry, these tend to be firms specialising in logistics or research and development.
Partnership with the oil sector has enabled transport and maritime services, alongside other professional or technical services (such as engineering, chemicals and research), to develop outside the oil sector. Business services, ICT, and wholesale and retail trade have been among the main growth drivers in recent years, and have remained fairly resilient throughout the pandemic. In contrast, activity in contact-intensive services such as hospitality, tourism, entertainment and arts was severely curtailed in 2020 and early 2021. However, the relative importance of these sectors to the Norwegian economy is smaller than in many peer countries, limiting the overall fallout.

Economic forecast: Inflation % 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Consumer prices 3.5 6.2 5.9 2.1 1.8 1.8
Average wages 4.8 6.5 5.7 2.8 2.5 2.5
Real wages 1.3 0.3 -0.2 0.7 0.7 0.7

Headline inflation has surged since its nadir of 0.7% in November 2020, to 6.8% in July 2022. The increase was initially driven by the higher cost of imported goods, particularly food and energy. Inflation as measured by Norges Bank's preferred measure, excluding energy prices and taxation, has remained lower, but, at 4.8%, has risen well above the central bank's 2% target rate, suggesting that inflation expectations have moved beyond those sectors and are starting to affect prices more widely. We expect inflation to accelerate from an average of 3.5% in 2021 to 6.2% in 2022 and remain elevated at 5.9% in 2023. Norway is less exposed to global price fluctuations in energy markets, as a major exporter, and the appreciation of the krone in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine will also have a deflationary impact, meaning that inflation is likely to remain below the levels seen elsewhere in Europe. We expect a gradual decline in energy prices and global monetary tightening to cause inflation to slow to 2.1% in 2024, stabilising at 1.8% thereafter.
In contrast to consumer price inflation, Norway's producer price inflation is much higher than in the EU, reflecting both high energy costs, and significant supply bottlenecks in the oil and gas sector as it expands to meet European demand. Producer price inflation averaged 37.9% in 2021, and we forecast that it will to accelerate to 56.5% in 2022 after quarterly growth of 11% and 13% in the first two quarters respectively. Given the ongoing bottlenecks in the energy sector, we expect producer price inflation to remain elevated in 2023, at 18%, before moderating from 2024.

The krone has largely followed the changes in global energy markets since January 2020, experiencing a substantial devaluation throughout 2020 before strengthening in 2021 and early 2022 as oil prices have risen and economic conditions have improved. This was particularly exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but has reversed as the initial shock to oil prices has subsided. We forecast that the krone will remain steady for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 against the euro, supported by still-high energy prices, forecast interest-rate increases and a large current-account surplus. It will slip slightly against the US dollar in the same period following a flight to safety among investors in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, and in response to the rapid tightening cycle by the US Federal Reserve (the central bank). From 2024 we expect the krone to weaken as global oil prices moderate. Further downward shifts in oil prices, chiefly from continued shocks to global demand, as well as geopolitical shocks due to Russian actions in the war in Ukraine and the corresponding sanctions, remain a risk to our exchange-rate forecasts.

Norway's current-account surpluses have historically been supported by large inflows on the trade and primary income accounts, reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG respectively, with the size of the surplus strongly correlated to the oil price. All components of the current account improved sharply in 2021, with the third-quarter current-account surplus the largest on record, which contributed to a huge full-year surplus, at 14.9% of GDP. The surplus will expand further in 2022, reaching 17.4% of GDP, as export earnings continue to rise, and remain elevated in 2023 at 16.8% of GDP. Gradually decreasing commodity prices in the remainder of the forecast period, combined with steady growth in imports, will contribute to a moderation in the size of the current-account surplus, to a still-large 9.1% of GDP in 2026.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Norway Stocks and flows Developments in Norway's large oil and gas sector and in global energy prices are major determinants of annual inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which tend to be more volatile than in many peer economies. According to data from the IMF, the stock of inward FDI totalled US$257bn at the end of 2020, equivalent to 71% of GDP. Per head, the FDI stock was US$47,711, comparatively high on a regional basis and a similar level to Sweden. The strongest period of FDI inflows occurred in 2005-12, averaging US$17bn per year. Since then, inward FDI has fluctuated between positive and negative annual flows. These have generally been modest in scale, although there was a substantial disinvestment of US$19bn in 2016 and a stronger inflow of US$17bn in 2019. On average over the 2013-19 period FDI inflows amounted to a subdued US$1.1bn per year. There was disinvestment of US$6.7bn in 2020, mirroring a global cooling of FDI activity given the elevated uncertainty and restricted mobility posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Origin and distribution Norway's oil-intensive economy means that FDI is largely focused on the oil and gas sector, in addition to ancillary services such as transport, infrastructure and finance. Most of the world's major oil and gas companies are involved in Norwegian oil production, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon (all US-based), BP (UK), RWE (Germany), Engie (France), Eni (Italy) and RoyalDutchShell (UK/Netherlands). According to Statistics Norway, in 2020 the mining and quarrying sector (including oil and gas) accounted for the single largest share (18%) of the FDI stock, followed by financial services (18%), manufacturing (12%), wholesale and retail trade (9%), and real estate (8%). Both manufacturing and financial services have considerable overlap with the oil and gas industry. Real estate and manufacturing accounted for the largest shares of FDI inflows in 2019. Based on unadjusted FDI data, Sweden is by some distance the single largest investor in Norway, accounting for 20% of the FDI stock in 2020, ahead of the US (10%), the Netherlands (9%), Luxembourg (9%), Denmark (7%) and the UK (7%). However, Norway is not always the final destination of this inward investment, serving also as a pan-regional distribution hub for third-country investment. As in many countries with established financial services sectors, Norway's FDI data are also partly skewed by inflows associated with "corporate reconfigurations"-changes in complex ownership structures of multinationals-rather than greenfield investment. Based on adjusted data whereby Norway is the "ultimate destination" of FDI, the single largest investor is the US (19% of the FDI stock), followed by Sweden (12%), Germany (7%), the UK (7%), Denmark (6%) and Finland (6%).
Determinants Aside from the potential large returns on offer to investors in the oil and gas sector, Norway offers a comparatively stable political and macroeconomic environment, a strong institutional framework, a generally low regulatory burden for firms, high-quality public services and infrastructure, a highly skilled workforce, openness to foreign investment and foreign trade, and established high value-added industry sectors. The constraint posed by Norway's small market size is partly mitigated by membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives Norwegian firms access to the wider European market. However, its geographical location does imply comparatively high transport and logistics costs, while limiting the country's attractiveness as an outsourcing or re-exporting base. High labour costs (in terms of wages, payroll taxes and fairly restrictive labour regulations) will tend to deter most labour-intensive industries, and scope for private enterprise is still constrained in some product and services markets, reflecting Norway's fairly high level of direct state ownership.
Impact FDI has encouraged the transfer of foreign knowledge to Norway and accelerated the development of the oil and gas sector over recent decades. The oil sector has, in turn, encouraged wider growth in the mainland economy through higher wages, consumer spending, and investment in infrastructure and public services, as well as via ancillary services such as transport and finance. Several of these ancillary services, notably supply and maintenance services, have become internationally competitive, despite the historically strong krone. Moreover, high taxation on developed oil wells has led to a resilient fiscal balance and a vast sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund Global. Employment in the oil and gas sector has trended lower since a 2014 peak, but various estimates suggest that it still accounts (directly or indirectly) for about 150,000-200 000 people, equivalent to approximately 6% of the labour force. It can be argued that a longstanding focus on the oil and gas sector has held back investment in other industries, leaving the Norwegian economy less diversified than some of its peers and playing catch up in key sectors. A majority of non-oil inward FDI has tended to involve the acquisition by overseas interests of existing Norwegian-based companies, rather than establishing new companies or facilities. As in many countries, increased foreign investor interest over recent decades has contributed to augmented imbalances in the real estate market.
Potential Gradual diversification efforts over the forecast period are likely to provide more opportunities for FDI in Norway's growing professional services industry (finance, information and communication technology, and legal) and in areas such as fintech, "cleantech" and biotechnology. Policymakers have made the development of the "High North" (the areas adjacent to the Arctic) a wider policy priority, offering various incentives and grants, including a reduction in the scale of employer contributions, with a focus on encouraging stronger growth in the maritime, healthcare and IT sectors there. Nevertheless, the bulk of opportunities for foreign investment will remain in the energy sector, encompassing oil, gas and green energy (such as wind power). Amid an increasing global focus on climate change and the environment, public sentiment towards new exploration and investment in the petroleum sector is gradually shifting. This is unlikely to trigger any dramatic near-term change in official policy towards fossil-fuel production in Norway, given its revenue-raising importance for the wider economy, but could lead to a gradual tightening of tax-relief measures and other incentives in the sector, reducing its overall attractiveness for new investment. Norway's robust political, macroeconomic, financial and institutional structures will remain appealing features for potential investors, as will the quality of the labour force and infrastructure. Set against this are the country's high labour costs, small market size and a comparatively high level of direct state ownership, which is likely to persist in 2022-26.

Population growth has slowed recently, but will remain positive in 2022-26 The population of Norway totalled 5.4m at end-2021, up from 4.9m in 2010 and 4.5m in 2000. Population growth averaged 1.2% per year in 2011-15, but has since moderated, averaging 0.6% per year in 2017-21. This slowdown has mainly been in response to reduced net immigration, alongside a gradual fall in the "natural increase" (annual births minus deaths). EIU expects a mild acceleration in population growth over the forecast period (2022-26) as global economic conditions improve and as international travel normalises. A gradual ageing of the population will continue, amid a slowly declining fertility rate and increasing life expectancy.
Annual net immigration was fairly stable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, averaging about 12,000 per year. Net inflows increased sharply from 2005 to a peak of 47,000 per year in 2011-12. Since then, net immigration has fallen steadily in response to domestic economic conditions, shifting regional migration trends, hardening public sentiment that has driven a tightening of immigration rules in Norway for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and most recently the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Net immigration reached 19,650 in 2021, a rebound from 11,331 in 2020 (the lowest level since 2003), but still well below its pre-pandemic level of 25,327. We expect net migration to rise in 2022, supported by the normalisation of travel following the pandemic disruption, as well as an influx of refugees from Ukraine, before continuing its downward trend thereafter.
There were just over 819,000 foreign citizens in Norway as at January 2022, equivalent to 15% of the total population. Polish migrants accounted for the largest share, with a population of 105,000, followed by Lithuanians (42,000), Swedes (36,000) and Syrians (34,000).
The fertility rate in Norway edged higher during the 2000s, but has fallen steadily over the past decade from a peak of 1.98 in 2009. The fertility rate reached 1.55 in 2021, its highest level since 2018 and up from a low of 1.48, the lowest level ever registered by Statistics Norway. However, this probably represents distortion driven by pandemic-related uncertainty delaying births in 2020, rather than a break in the trend. The overall downward trend reflects in part a sharp decline in births by women in the 20-30 age group. With life expectancy increasing, the overall population will continue to age gradually over the forecast period. The share of the population aged 67 or over is projected to rise to 19% in 2026, according to UN figures, from 16.3% in 2015. The share of the working-age (15-66) population peaked at 66% in 2009; since then it has gradually declined. The size of the working-age population is forecast to increase at a modest rate over the coming years, supported by net immigration. However, its share of the total population will maintain its downward trend, falling to 63.5% by 2026.
The demographic challenge is not as severe as in other European countries Norway's population is not ageing quite as rapidly as in some EU countries, but its upward direction nevertheless implies steadily increasing pressures on the public finances, with older citizens requiring more state support in the form of pensions, health and social care. Reforms aimed at bolstering the sustainability of the pension system via flexible retirement ages (from 62 to 75), adjustments for life expectancy and less generous indexation have been implemented since the early 2000s. Further changes are likely over the forecast period, with a focus on disincentivising early retirement. Healthcare expenditure will continue to rise steadily, along with the median age of the population. Greater fiscal burdens will also be placed on local and municipal government, as the burden of social care for the aged, in the form of live-in helpers or retirement homes, will also steadily increase as the average age of the population rises.
Owing to Norway's unique geography, with a long coastline and separated settlements, rural areas are far more dispersed than in many other European countries, raising the cost of services provision for isolated communities. This is aggravated by an increasingly concentrated population as a whole, with 83.3% of Norway's population living in urban areas in 2021. Areas in the far north of Norway are remote and underpopulated; Finnmark, the northernmost region, has a population of 76,000 dispersed across 48,600 sq km. The cost of maintaining public service provision in rural areas was a driver behind the "municipal reform" implemented by the Conservatives-led government in 2020.

Norway will remain one of the world's wealthiest countries Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, with elevated levels of GDP per head and median household income, and access to the EU single market via membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). Market opportunities are constrained, however, by the comparatively small size of the domestic market, its geographical location and high operating costs. In terms of GDP per head (at market exchange rates), Norway ranked fourth in the world in 2021, at about US$94,394, behind only Luxembourg, Switzerland and Ireland. Measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), adjusting for different price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates, Norway ranked seventh, behind also Singapore, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The country's population of 5.4m is among the smallest in western Europe, just above that of Ireland and marginally lower than in Denmark and Finland. In terms of market size, nominal GDP of US$480bn in 2021 was about one-third larger than in Finland and Portugal and similar in scale to Denmark, accounting for a modest 0.5% of global GDP. Estimates of the distribution of household income (such as the Gini index) point to a comparatively low level of inequality in Norway, reflecting relatively high rates of marginal taxation and redistribution, alongside high levels of trust and co-operation within its society.
Norway's consumer goods market is modest in size, similar to those of Denmark and Portugal and about one-tenth that of the UK. Household consumption per head (at US$34,730 in 2021) is among the highest in western Europe and above all its Nordic peers. Norway's share of private consumption in total GDP is lower than in most west European economies, mainly owing to a large public sector. In 2021 household consumption accounted for 39% of GDP, well below that of the UK (61%), Italy (58%), France (52%), Finland (51%) and Germany (49%), and slightly lower than in Denmark (46%) and Sweden (44%). Real consumption growth averaged 3% per year in 2010-15, moderating to 1.7% per year in 2016-19. The pandemic triggered a slump in consumer spending in 2020, but also a spike in household savings. EIU expects that the savings glut will be exhausted by 2023, with household savings rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Consumer spending is therefore likely to slow markedly in late 2022 and 2023 owing to higher inflation across Europe (although it will remain positive, unlike in many of Norway's European peer countries). We expect a gradual rebound in 2024-26, with household consumption per head in 2026 forecast at US$45,830 and GDP per head at US$114,458 at market exchange rates.

The dominance of the oil sector prevents substantial diversification Most consumer durables markets are relatively open to competition, with many small, medium-sized and niche players competing. As the extent of domestic manufacturing is limited, the bulk of consumer goods are imported. Elevated labour costs are one of the main disadvantages for firms operating in Norway, being among the highest in Europe. Geographically, the country is connected to few of its major export markets (except Sweden) by land, restricting its scope as a major business or commercial hub for the rest of Europe. The dominance of the oil sector, on both skilled labour and the currency, also serves to constrain efforts to diversify the economy into other industries, as has been achieved in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark.

Initial conditions: Aided by its rich endowment of offshore oil and gas, Norway's GDP growth has outperformed that of its European neighbours over the past decade, averaging 1.3% in 2010-20, compared with a euro area average of 0.7%. With only about half of its petroleum reserves extracted to date, the country will retain its pre-eminence in European energy production throughout EIU's long-term forecast period (2022-50). However, pressures on the oil and gas sector will steadily rise as government policy becomes less accommodative and environmental concerns become more prominent in the national debate. Although participation rates in Norway are high, one long-term challenge for the government will be to reverse the trend among older workers to take early retirement. To this effect, the pension system is undergoing more reform, including via a pension adjustment linked to life expectancy, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Technological change has increasingly supported Norwegian growth, with the application of communications and IT becoming more widespread over the past decade, supporting productivity gains. Risk factors are a slowing pace of product market reforms and the overwhelming influence of the oil sector on the economy, limiting diversification and promoting exchange-rate volatility.

Demographic trends: Norway, like many other OECD countries, faces a steadily ageing population, driven by both a socioeconomic trend towards a lower birth rate and a preference for marrying later, which have been evident since the 1960s. However, in the Norwegian case these trends have been slower to materialise, and immigration is higher than in the country's European neighbours, so Norway is in a more favourable position to face the challenges of an ageing population relative to other developed countries. Growth of the total population and the working-age population will remain positive, although the latter will ease from about 1% per year in 2000-20 to about 0.4% in 2041-50. Concurrently, the proportion of those aged 67 years or above, and the old-age dependency ratio (those aged 67 and over relative to those aged 15-66) will increase, leading to greater fiscal pressure on the government, which provides old age services and transfers. Further rises in the participation rate (which is already among the highest in the world) or improvements to worker productivity will be needed to maintain the social safety net.

Even taking into account the flow of oil revenue, pension liabilities will greatly exceed the expected assets of the entire Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund that was created to ensure that future generations would benefit from the country's oil riches). There is concern that current pension reforms do not go far enough in tackling the problems related to work incentives and the generous scale of public-sector pensions. The government will need to take further action over the coming decade to avoid a sharply rising tax burden.

Disruption from the pandemic could undermine Norway's trading position
External conditions: As a small country that is highly dependent on open markets and free trade, Norway stands to benefit from its European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which extends the EU's single market to include it. The EU is the world's largest and most integrated regional market, and accounts for the vast majority of Norwegian exports and imports. Set against this, the EU's long-term rate of growth is likely to remain moderate. Another uncertainty over the forecast period concerns Norway's position with respect to the EU. Within the EU, although some progress will be made in advancing trade in goods and the liberalisation of trade in services, the focus-particularly in the next decade-will be on ensuring that there is no reversal of these policies. Protectionist forces will increase in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, but, as Norway is less well integrated into global supply chains, the impact of this pressure will be less than in other countries. Although effort has gone into improving Norway-China economic relations, we expect collaboration to be confined to specific sectors, such as fish or oil exports, limiting effectiveness.

The sovereign wealth fund may not be adequate to cover pension costs
Institutions and policy trends: Norway has a long democratic history and enjoys stable, democratic and transparent institutions, along with a well-entrenched justice system. Corruption is largely absent from Norwegian political and business life. The prospects for stable growth are enhanced by high levels of benefits and state-funded education, including at tertiary level, which ensures a healthy and well-educated workforce. In the long term, however, the welfare state may not be as well funded as it is currently. Norway favours free enterprise and market competition to a lesser extent than Denmark and Sweden. The state remains a significant player in many sectors, such as telecommunications, banking, energy and the offshore sector, and progress on the government's plan to reduce its stakes in some companies has been slow. Norway also lags neighbouring countries in efforts to promote competition in major product and labour markets, in part because the country's oil riches provide little incentive for policymakers to enact potentially unpopular structural reforms. Similarly, there is a risk that the existence of the GPFG will mask the need for reforms to the social-security system. Ongoing pension reforms include incentives to work beyond retirement age, and cut the link between pension payments and wages; these reform efforts are expected to continue in the coming years. However, government projections indicate that the assets of the pension fund will be insufficient to cover the state's liabilities arising from pensions and other demands on the public purse (such as healthcare) in the absence of further reform of both the pension system and the labour market. Measures would have to include further discouragement from taking early retirement or drawing disability benefits (the proportion of the workforce drawing disability benefit in Norway is almost double the average for the OECD). Ensuring the sustainability of Norway's generous welfare state will be an important challenge for future governments.

Strong investment and productivity growth will raise long term output
Long-term performance: As Norway has less scope than most other developed economies to raise its labour force participation rate, its long-term economic prospects will depend on a continued high rate of investment, as well as improvements in productivity, which we expect to rise during the forecast period (to an average of 0.5% in 2022-50), having been sluggish for much of the past decade (at an average of 0.2% in 2011-20). Long-term economic performance will also depend on how successive governments meet the challenge of structural reform. Given regular large surpluses on the general government budget prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it is often easy for policymakers to ignore non-oil budget deficits. A failure to adapt social-security and welfare systems to the challenge of population ageing would lead to large fiscal deficits towards the end of the long-term forecast period in 2050, which would necessitate a rising tax burden and dampen growth. This would be exacerbated should oil production fall markedly, making continued investment in exploration important.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The majority of Norway's emissions come from the exploitation of the country's oil and gas reserves, with aluminium production also contributing. Domestic energy usage, which is largely met through abundant hydroelectric infrastructure, is not an important contributor to Norway's carbon emissions, unlike in other advanced economies. Norway also has the highest electric vehicle (EV) penetration by far, with battery-powered EVs representing 65% of new cars sold in 2021, and a full phase-out of petrol-powered cars planned from 2025. The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) has become more strident in its support of environmental concerns over the past few years. In 2016 two new criteria were established by the fund, requiring it to move away from, firstly, companies with unacceptable greenhouse-gas emissions and, secondly, companies for which at least 30% of revenue is derived from thermal coal or operations based on thermal coal. In March 2019 the government established a further criterion forcing the fund to divest from upstream firms specialising in oil and gas exploration, although its holdings of generalised energy firms, including all major publicly traded oil producers, have remained. The new government has raised its 2030 emissions reduction target, which now stands at 55% below 1990 levels.
Despite efforts by successive governments to bolster environmental policy, a substantial effort to reduce oil-related activities is unlikely, with further reform only likely to limit the sector's growth, rather than reverse it. Aided by the economic need for further diversification, political pressure is mounting from some smaller parties to curtail the oil sector's development. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis is likely to delay efforts in this area for several years Eventually, EIU expects a gradual erosion of the country's generous tax incentives for oil exploration, and efforts to reduce flaring, leakages and other emissions produced as a by-product of the extraction process rather than an active effort to shrink the sector.
Norway will be relatively sheltered from the impact of climate change. With a small agricultural sector and a mostly urban population, the country is easily protected from the warming planet. With the majority of economic output concentrated in the area around Oslo, the capital, and the coastal cities of Bergan, Stavanger and Trondheim, the protection of urban areas against rising sea levels and weather events will be central to Norway's strategy to mitigate the economic effects of climate change. The opening up of new areas for oil exploration in the Arctic Circle (as ice cover falls) will be an upside risk to Norwegian growth and should mitigate some costs to output.
Migration and urbanisation Norway has largely adopted an accommodative policy towards migration since the late 1970s, and the migrant population (including those of Norwegian birth, but with two parents born abroad) in 2021 was some 900,000, comprising approximately 17% of the country's total population. Annual net immigration was fairly stable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, averaging about 12,000 per year. Net inflows rose sharply from 2005 to a peak of 47,000 per year in 2011-12. The bulk of these migrants came from eastern Europe after the region's transition into the EU. Since then, net immigration has fallen steadily in response to domestic economic conditions, shifting regional migration trends, hardening public sentiment that has driven a tightening of immigration rules in Norway for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and most recently the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Polish migrants account for the largest share of the total migrant population, followed by Lithuanians and Swedes.
Recent migration has increasingly come from non-European countries such as Syria, Somalia and Eritrea. These migrants have proved more politically contentious, as greater differences in cultural background and socioeconomic status have led to concerns about integration; the far-right Progress Party has included the reduction of non-European migration as part of its policy agenda. However, we expect Norway's collaborative political system to continue to adopt a reasonably accommodative stance on immigration and integration.
Norway's population has become more urbanised as the economy has developed. According to the World Bank, urbanisation rates surpassed 50% in 1960, rising rapidly over the next 20 years to 70.5% in 1980. Since then, the pace of urban growth has been more subdued, with the rate only surpassing 80% in 2013, reaching 82% 2020. Norway remains the most rural of the Scandinavian economies, with urbanisation rates in Sweden and Denmark slightly higher, at 87% and 88% respectively. This is in part due to Norway's large land area and long sea coast, making rural communities more isolated, but also because Norway was historically rural and underdeveloped compared with its Scandinavian peers, and so has further to catch up with its neighbours. The difficulties of paying for high standards of public service provision to an ageing and diminishing population in rural areas are putting pressure on the government to reduce costs. This was the motivation behind the "municipal reform" circulated in 2014, which will aggregate the municipal and county authorities together to encourage greater economies of scale and information-sharing in local government services.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. EIU's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows the EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by the EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2017-21) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2022-26). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by the EIU for 2017-21. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2022-26 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2017-21 ranges are then used to derive 2022-26 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2022-26, not to the likely situation in 2026 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2019 or 2024). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Italy's government, led by a former president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, collapsed on July 20th, triggering a snap election to be held on September 25th 2022. EIU expects a right-wing coalition comprising the increasingly popular far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI), the right-wing Lega and the centre-right Forza Italia (which is currently polling at about 46%) to win a comfortable majority of seats in parliament. The window to pass important pending structural reforms for the current government is closed, but the prospect of receiving additional fiscal support from the EU will provide the next government with a strong incentive to comply with the EU conditionality (which is soft by design), in order to unlock the remaining EU recovery funds (EUR191.5bn in grants and loans in 2021-26, or about 9.6% of GDP).

- Italy's score improves moderately during the forecast period (2022-26), but the country declines by one place in the global ranking and remains 16th in western Europe in the regional ranking. The scores improve across a broad range of categories, resulting in rises in Italy's global rankings for macroeconomic policy, policy towards foreign investment, taxes and financing. This reflects the impact of modest reforms by successive governments since late 2011 and the implementation by the government of national unity, led by Mr Draghi, of some of the reforms contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP). However, the outlook for economic growth has deteriorated owing to the cost-of-living and energy crises, which have been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

- Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU after Germany and France, and the eighth largest globally. GDP per head is below the euro zone average Following a contraction of 9.1% in 2020, Italy's real GDP rebounded by 6.6% in 2021, making it one of the surprise performers in Europe last year, considering its dismal growth record since 1990. Tightening monetary policy conditions, increased political risk, higher inflation and the expected energy crunch in the winter of 2022/23 will result in output contracting in 2023. In 2024-26 growth will average 1.2%. Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenges include making policies more socially inclusive and putting public debt on a sustainable downward path, while addressing the cost-of-living and energy crises.

We expect the population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 58.3m in 2026, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows.

- Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 46% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

- Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average 0.8% per year in 2022-50 (the long-term forecast period). A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. From 1996 to 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre-left. Following the 2018 election, M5S and the right-wing Lega formed a government led by Giuseppe Conte, but it was unstable and undermined Italy's relations with the EU. In an agreement to avert a snap election in late 2019, M5S and the pro-European centre-left Partito Democratico formed a new government, also led by Mr Conte. After a government crisis in early 2021, Mario Draghi, an independent and former European Central Bank president, was appointed prime minister in February, receiving unusually broad support. The Draghi government collapsed eight months before the end of the parliamentary term on July 20th 2022.
Political structure: Parliament, comprising two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis, the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government.
Policy issues: The near-term policy priorities will be to address the current energy crisis and implement Italy's national plan to unlock the EUR191.5bn EU recovery fund money in 2021-26. The government is focusing on long-delayed structural reforms such as taxation, justice, competition and public administration. Past attempts to reform Italy's inefficient civil justice system, complex bureaucracy and tax system have achieved only cosmetic results, owing to the widespread unpopularity of such measures.
Taxation: The top rate of personal-income tax is 43%, and social-security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation-tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes, including the regional business tax (IRAP), are levied to fund healthcare services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.9%. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$585bn in 2021, and imports (fob) at US$523bn. In the same year, the current account recorded a surplus of US$53bn, or 2.5% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The March 2018 general election yielded a fragmented parliament. The centre-right coalition fell short of the roughly 40% of votes needed to win a majority under the most recent electoral law, the so-called Rosatellum 2, coming in at 37%. Within the coalition, the populist, anti-immigration Lega (17.4%) surpassed Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI; 14%), which had previously been seen as the leading party on the right, and polled well ahead of the hard-right, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia (FdI; 4.4%). The election also saw a surge in support for the populist, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of vote, making it by far the country's largest party. After three months of difficult coalition talks, M5S and the Lega agreed to form a government under the leadership of a technocratic prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. The mainstream centre-left Partito Democratico (PD), under the leadership of Matteo Renzi, won just 18.9% of the vote, an all-time low, leading to Mr Renzi's resignation and the election of a new party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in March 2019 (who was subsequently replaced by Enrico Letta in March 2021). The PD and its smaller coalition partners won a combined vote share of just 22.3%, and Liberi e Uguale (LeU)-a formation made up of primarily left-wing splinter parties that spun off from the PD in opposition to Mr Renzi's leadership-took 3.4% of the vote. In August 2019 the Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, withdrew from the coalition to try to engineer a snap general election in order to turn a surge in electoral support for Mr Salvini into seats in parliament, where the Lega is only the third-largest party, behind M5S and the PD. To avert a snap election, M5S and the PD, which had previously been fierce opponents, unexpectedly put aside their differences and agreed to form a new government, still led by Mr Conte. The latest crisis led to the formation of a national unity government led by a former head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, in February 2021. The Draghi government collapsed eight months before the end of the parliamentary term on July 20th.

Political outlook: Political stability Italy's internationally respected government of national unity, led by Mr Draghi, collapsed on July 20th, triggering a snap election to be held on September 25th 2022. Mr Draghi's resignation followed months of tensions within the broad coalition backing his government and a week-long crisis, during which he was unable to persuade the parties to renew their coalition agreement and refocus on the many economic and social challenges facing Italy. On June 20th three of the ruling parties-the right-wing Lega, the centre-right Forza Italia and the populist M5S-decided to boycott a vote of confidence in the Senate (the upper house of parliament), in effect causing the fall of the government, which had been in power since February 2021.
EIU expects a right-wing coalition comprising the increasingly popular FdI, the Lega and Forza Italia (which together are currently polling at about 46%) to win a comfortable majority of seats in parliament in September. There is a risk that the right-wing parties will win two-thirds of the seats, which would give them the power to change the constitution, but also to overcome most checks and balances. Such a scenario would be perceived as negative by investors, as the right-wing parties would have leeway to pass radical, market-unfriendly policies (such as calling a referendum on euro membership).
A snap election in the autumn is bad news for Italy, as the country will see a further rise in risk premiums at a time of tightening financial conditions, slowing economic growth, record-high inflation and an energy crunch in the winter of 2022/23 as Russia cuts off gas supplies. It also means that the window to approve the 2023 budget and meet reform milestones for the next disbursement of EU recovery fund money by year-end will be tight. The window to pass important pending structural reforms is closed, but the prospect of receiving additional fiscal support from the EU will provide the next government with a strong incentive to comply with the EU conditionality (which is soft by design), in order to unlock the remaining EU recovery funds (EUR191.5bn in grants and loans in 2021-26, or about 9.6% of GDP).
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Italy is governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system all bills must be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. This is unlikely to change following the rejection in 2016 of the Renzi government's constitutional reform package, which sought to reduce drastically the legislative powers of the Senate and would have effectively made the parliament quasi-unicameral. There are plans to cut radically the number of members of parliament before the next election, but further much-needed institutional reform is unlikely.
Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. Modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to gradually speed up some bureaucratic procedures, although, given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 has been slow. In July 2020 the M5S-PD government approved a package of measures (the so-called "simplification decree") aimed at cutting red tape. Attempts by previous governments to reduce bureaucratic procedures have been largely unsuccessful, and Italy still has among the highest levels of red tape in Europe.
A reform of the judicial system should speed up court proceedings in 2021-25 Italy has one of slowest justice systems in the EU: the average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute is more than double that in some other member states. A partial reform of the judicial system was undertaken in 2014-16. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers that acts as a disincentive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. Perceived interference or pressure from government and politicians is also a major issue. In August 2021 parliament approved amendments to reform the justice system-one of the main reforms agreed with the EU to unlock EUR191.5bn in funds. The aims of the reform are to speed up court proceedings, reduce backlogs and implement stricter statutes of limitation for criminal prosecutions. We expect the reform to lead to some improvement in Italy's justice system over the 2022-26 forecast period (albeit from a low base).
Previous reforms to reduce corruption have had limited impact Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then government action appears to have intensified. In June 2014 the powers of the anti-corruption authority were strengthened, and less than a year later parliament approved another anti-corruption law, including provisions eliminating the minimum threshold for the prosecution of accounting fraud and introducing harsher prison sentences for this offense, as well as for corruption of public officials, embezzlement and mafia association. The M5S-Lega government passed further anti-corruption legislation at end-2018, imposing harsher criminal penalties and public-office bans for graft, and from 2020 applying the statute of limitations only to first-instance trials so that fewer cases are dismissed owing to a lengthy appeals process. The Draghi government introduced new anti-corruption responsibilities for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which will be in charge of preventing fraud and monitoring conflicts of interest.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury, and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch The next general election will take place on September 25th instead of spring 2023. The political landscape has changed significantly since the March 2018 election. According to the latest two-week weighted average of opinion polls published by YouTrend, an Italian pollster, the far-right FdI has more than tripled its support since 2018, to about 23.4% in mid-August, to become the most popular party. Support for the centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) has remained broadly stable, at 18-22%, but has picked up to about 23% since the collapse of the Draghi government on July 20th. Support for the Lega has dropped by more than 20 percentage points in opinion polls since the M5S-Lega government collapsed in August 2019, to 13.4% in late June, mainly to the benefit of the FdI. Support for M5S has more than halved, from 33% to about 10%, according to the latest polls.
Current opinion polls suggest that a right-wing coalition comprising the FdI, the Lega and Forza Italia will win a comfortable majority of seats in parliament. Failure to implement plans to overhaul the electoral law and introduce a more proportional voting system before the government crisis means that the snap election will be held under the current mixed system, which allocates a third of seats in each parliamentary house through single-member districts and just under two-thirds by proportional representation. The threshold in both chambers is 3% at the national level for individual parties or lists and 10% for coalitions. Combined support for the right-wing alliance is currently at about 46%, well above the implicit threshold of about 40% needed to win a majority under the Rosatellum 2 electoral law.
Political outlook: International relations The EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been unprecedented and closely co-ordinated with the US and other Western allies. Seven packages of financial and individual sanctions have been imposed by the EU on Russia, marking a sharp change from the EU's reluctance to impose severe measures after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. We expect these sanctions on Russia to remain in place throughout the forecast period.
The EU is in the process of reducing its reliance on Russian energy, which will cause significant changes to the bloc's energy mix and infrastructure in the medium term. Following cuts to Russian gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in June and July, the EU is increasingly concerned that it will not be able to secure sufficient gas supply for the winter. EU leaders have agreed a plan for member states to cut 15% of their gas consumption between August 2022 and March 2023, albeit with numerous opt-outs should this target become mandatory rather than voluntary.
The EU is taking steps to mitigate the impact of the conflict on consumers and businesses. As during the pandemic, the EU has relaxed state aid rules to help companies that are facing a sharp increase in input prices, and its fiscal rules will remain suspended for another year, until 2024.
We expect the war in Ukraine to remain a "hot" conflict until at least end-2022 and probably beyond; in the medium term it could settle into a protracted conflict with no real end in sight. EU leaders have agreed to give EUR2.5bn in arms and aid to Ukraine's military. Russia's invasion of Ukraine will spur EU countries to increase their defence spending and support for NATO-in April Italy agreed to boost defence spending from the current 1.4% of GDP to 2% by 2028.

Italy's business environment score improves moderately during the forecast period (2022-26), but the country falls by one place in the global ranking and remains 16th in western Europe in the regional ranking. The scores improve across a broad range of categories, resulting in rises in Italy's global rankings for macroeconomic policy, policy towards foreign investment, taxes, and financing. The improvement reflects the impact of modest economic reforms by successive governments since late 2011 and the implementation by the government of national unity, led by Mario Draghi, of some of the reforms contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), allowing the government to access the substantial financial support on offer from the EU. However, the outlook for economic growth and policymaking has deteriorated owing to the cost-of-living and energy crises, which have been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, and EIU expects an increase in political instability at least in the short term owing to the collapse of the Draghi government in July 2022, which has triggered a snap general election scheduled for September 25th. The number of members of parliament will be reduced by more than a third after the election, but further much-needed institutional reform is unlikely. Previous reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact, and it remains to be seen whether the Draghi government's actions in these areas will produce better results. Despite various past reforms, we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment, and evasion to remain widespread, despite efforts to improve compliance. Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets has made some progress, but the sector remains vulnerable.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2022-23: The collapse of the administration led by Mario Draghi is likely to disrupt progress on competition reforms.
2024-26: Improvements in competition policy depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment 2022-23: Modest reductions in red tape. Government imposes penalties on foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2024-26: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2022-23: Pressure on export sector from supply-chain and trade shocks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.
2024-26: An EU-US agreement remains elusive. Risk of euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low.
Taxes 2022-23: The Draghi government's collapse derails personal and corporate tax reform plans. The temporary value-added tax (VAT) rate cut on gas could be extended beyond September 2022 to tackle the cost-of-living and energy crises.
2024-26: If implemented, 15% global minimum corporate tax rate to replace "digital tax" on foreign multinational firms.
Financing 2022-23: Monetary policy tightening, with the European Central Bank (ECB) raising interest rates as support programmes to bolster financial market and corporate liquidity are withdrawn.
2024-26: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign persists. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market 2022-23: "Citizenship income" remains in place, but the dilution of pension reforms is partly reversed.
2024-26: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure 2022-23: Bureaucratic obstacles constrain government plans for higher investment spending. Global energy crisis increases focus on investments to boost security and diversification of supply.
2024-26: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness 2022-23: Further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keep research and development (R&D) spending low.
2024-26: Gradually improving economic prospects (as well as Brexit) encourage more information and communications technology graduates to seek work in Italy. Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

We expect Italy's macroeconomic environment score to improve only slightly in the forecast period. However, because of falling scores or smaller improvements in other countries, Italy's global and regional rankings have improved.
Interest-rate rises will increase financial risk due to weak public finances Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenges include supporting investment and employment, making policies more socially inclusive and putting public debt on a sustainable downward path, while addressing the cost-of-living and energy crises. The size of the country's public debt and its record of weak government effectiveness will continue to be causes for concern for its core euro zone creditor countries, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector. The ultra-accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) in recent years has helped to keep government borrowing costs low and mitigate the financial risks attached to Italy's weak public finances. A monetary policy tightening cycle to combat the surge in inflation has now begun, causing government bond yields to rise and risk premiums to widen. Nevertheless, we expect the ECB to adopt instruments to avoid a further sharp rise in financial fragmentation risk in the euro area, helping to contain the rise in government borrowing costs for heavily indebted countries such as Italy. Despite some progress in recent years, economic reforms have generally been introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and implementation has remained an issue. Further measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are planned under Italy's NRRP, but implementation is still likely to be an issue.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and justice system. Generally, EU directives have been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy, transport and professional services. The expansion of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet into Italy has opened up the air passenger transport market. However, an agreement reached between the European Commission and the Italian government in July 2021 allowed a new company, Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA Airways), to be carved out of Italy's loss-making national carrier, the state-owned Alitalia, after more than four years in administration. The state provided EUR3bn to finance the new company, which it is seeking to sell to another airline. Under Italy's NRRP, the Draghi government pledged to improve regulations in specific sectors and to remove barriers to competition, including a simplification of the public procurement framework and the prioritisation of competitive processes to award local public service contracts. However, as with past reform plans, aspects of the 2022 competition bill faced strong opposition from some political circles and business associations. Following the collapse of the Draghi government, the bill is likely to be diluted if it is passed before the September general election. Implementation is also likely to be an issue without an overhaul of the public administration and judicial system. In 2010 the powers of the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) were strengthened and its remit extended to cover the provision of public services, but political pressure has generally limited effectiveness. This is also true of other watchdogs, including the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market, and the telecoms watchdog, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM).
External constraints will continue to be the main drivers of liberalisation
- Having been delayed several times owing to the pandemic, the implementation of a new bankruptcy code adopted in early 2019 only came into force in part in mid-July 2022, with safeguarding procedures delayed until end-2023. However, in August 2021 the Draghi government also introduced new out-of-court procedure for business restructuring. This should help to accelerate the process, with the courts intervening only in the event of a failure to reach an agreement between the debtor and creditors.
- Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Improvements introduced in 2014-17 include extended prison sentences for some white-collar crimes such as bribery, the establishment of support offices to reduce the backlog in Italy's Supreme Court and an extension of the statute of limitations for serious crimes. The Draghi government adopted further changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases. However, political opposition and resistance to change remain strong in the judicial system, which is likely to hamper implementation.

Further privatisation of major state-controlled companies is unlikely
- Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa (CDP)-the state-owned development bank-already has sizeable stakes in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel; Italy's electricity transmission company, Terna; the shipbuilder Fincantieri; and Poste Italiane. We expect CDP's role in the economy to expand further as it provides support for businesses recovering from the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

The positive impact of economic reforms will only be felt incrementally FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to its bureaucratic and legal complexities, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Under past governments, labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and the streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues. However, given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU countries. In 2019 Italy controversially became the first G7 country to sign a memorandum of understanding to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative-China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. Chinese investors signed 29 separate deals for projects worth a total of EUR2.5bn, including investment in several major Italian ports such as Trieste and Genoa. Fears that Chinese firms could take control of strategic sectors have so far proved to be unfounded. Hardening sentiment at the EU level towards foreign takeovers and non-EU inward FDI-with a particular focus on inflows from China-has resulted in tighter regional screening provisions since 2017. The economic fallout from the pandemic and the cost-of-living and energy crises is likely to spur greater scrutiny at the EU level, with Italy having extended domestic restrictions on acquisitions to cover banks, insurers, healthcare and energy.
Foreign takeovers, especially of luxury goods brands, are likely to continue
- The 2011-14 economic downturn hit corporate balance sheets and Italian firms' ability to raise capital. As a result, foreign companies acquired or merged with a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors, such as Bulgari, Valentino, Loro Piana and Luxottica. The overhang from the coronavirus-induced recession and the impact of the Ukraine crisis on international trade and the prices of energy and other commodities will weigh heavily on firms' balance sheets and equity valuations, so there is likely to be renewed foreign interest in acquisitions of Italian companies.

Italy's score in this category deteriorates in the forecast period, leading to a large fall in its global ranking. The deterioration reflects the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis on global trade, exacerbating existing supply-chain issues caused by the pandemic, but we expect the effects to be felt most acutely in Europe, especially in countries that are heavily dependent on imported energy. Italy's foreign trade regime is largely defined by its EU membership. Freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the bloc, and we do not expect any exchange controls. There is a risk of further temporary border closures and travel restrictions within the Schengen area in the case of further waves of coronavirus infections across Europe, but this risk will decrease over time, owing to high levels of vaccination. Industrial supply chains staged a fairly rapid bounce-back from the initial pandemic-driven disruption in the first half of 2020. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU; most non-tariff restrictions have been abolished, and administrative costs related to cross-border trade are low. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extreme cases, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the jurisprudence of which has played a major role in developing the single market. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland is unrestricted under the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA). The EU also has a customs union with Turkey and a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland. All of these arrangements exclude agriculture. Trade with other non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties, with bilateral and regional agreements providing for lower or zero tariffs, as well as co-operation on non-tariff barriers.
The EU will increasingly focus on bilateral trade deals
- The EU remains committed to the WTO and its dispute arbitration procedures, but an as-yet-unresolved appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body since late 2019 has undermined their effectiveness. Despite expectations that the administration of Joe Biden in the US would take a multilateral approach to trade, it has so far not changed its position regarding appointments to the Appellate Body. As support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed, the EU has shifted its focus towards negotiating bilateral trade deals. These include agreements with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, an upgrade of its deal with Mexico and the launch of trade talks with Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. A provisional agreement was reached with Mercosur (the South American trading bloc) in 2019, following 20 years of talks. However, there is strong opposition in some EU member states to aspects of the deal (mostly related to agriculture), which is likely to disrupt implementation.

The EU will face a volatile trading environment in the coming years
- Although global trade staged an impressive recovery from the initial pandemic shock, it remains vulnerable to persistent supply bottlenecks, which have been exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis. Many existing geopolitical trends, such as US-China frictions, a rise in nationalist anti-globalist policies and the shift in the economic balance of power from West to East will persist. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market is likely to encourage trade diversification over the medium term.

Italy's tax system remains highly complex, so compliance is costly Italy's score for taxation improves in the forecast period, but the country ranks ninth from last in the global ranking and last in the regional ranking in 2022-26. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, we expect the tax system to remain complex, making compliance costly and time-consuming for private-sector companies. In addition, despite some modest tax cuts since 2014 and measures such as tax payment deferrals during the coronavirus crisis, the tax burden will remain high and is unlikely to decline much owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements. Some progress has been made in reducing tax evasion and avoidance in Italy since the 2013 crisis, but it remains widespread, having been encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, the limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. The government introduced a 3% "digital services tax" on multinational companies in 2020. The tax will be replaced by the 15% global minimum tax for large companies agreed in 2021, if implemented.

- According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue/GDP (including social-security contributions) stood at 43.4% in 2021, up from 42.8% in 2020 and 42.3% in 2019 and above the euro zone average of 41.5% in 2020 (latest available data). According to Eurostat data, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base for low-wage earners), at 44.1% in 2020, its highest level since 2014 and much higher than the euro zone average of 38.5%. At 15.8% in 2020, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU, highlighting that there is scope to shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour.

Despite promises to reduce labour taxes, they will remain high
- Despite a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017, Italy's standard rate of corporate tax is relatively high, at 24%. In addition, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Company social-security contribution rates are also high by international comparison, at 30% (9.5% for employees). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest rates in Europe), is significantly reduced. For the 2022 tax year the government reduced the number of personal income tax brackets from five to four and tweaked the middle-income tax rates and brackets, but kept the marginal rate at 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR50,000 (down sharply from EUR75,000 previously).
- The Draghi government pledged in the NRRP to improve the tax administration, simplify the tax system and reduce evasion, but implementing such reforms will be challenging. A framework proposing to gradually abolish IRAP, further reduce the number of personal income tax brackets to three and overhaul the system of property registry valuations was still going through parliament in July 2022 when the government collapsed. The reform, along with plans to reduce the labour tax wedge, may not be passed before the election in September. The reform plan may be scrapped or, more likely, diluted under the next government.

Italy's score and rankings improve in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation in the banking sector, support recapitalisation and tackle the issue of high NPLs. The sector's main shortcomings are fragmentation, with few large banks and many small and medium-sized lenders; high operating costs because of excessive branch networks and personnel costs; low profitability; and heavy exposure to the sovereign, which leaves it vulnerable when concerns about government-debt sustainability increase. NPLs have declined considerably in recent years, but are still high, at 3% of total credit at the end of the first quarter of 2022. This is well below the peak of 16.9% in 2015, but above the EU average of 1.9%. Much of the decline has been the result of large NPL securitisation operations by a few major Italian banks. Italy's smaller banks have made slower progress. With a view to supporting these banks' efforts to reduce NPLs on their balance sheets, the government introduced a system of guarantees (Garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) in 2016. The scheme expired in July 2022, after several extensions approved by the European Commission. When the Draghi government collapsed the Italian authorities were reportedly considering an amended scheme with stricter terms.
Fragmentation of the banking sector will be reduced only gradually
- Progress towards consolidation in the sector has been slow, but the successful takeover in 2020 of UBI Banca, Italy's sixth-largest bank, by Intesa Sanpaolo, the second largest, suggests that a new wave of bank mergers and acquisitions is likely during the forecast period. However, government efforts to encourage one of Italy's main banks to take over its stake in Monte Paschi di Siena (MPS) have been unsuccessful. Having rescued MPS, Italy's fifth-largest bank at the time, at a cost of EUR5.4bn in late 2016 when it came close to collapse, the Italian state will inject further capital in 2022 while the bank's new management implements a fresh restructuring plan before trying again to sell the bank.
- The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2021 included five major Italian banks: Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco BPM, MPS and Mediobanca. Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco BPM and Mediobanca were reasonably resilient to the three-year adverse scenario tested, but all four banks' performances were below the EU average, with the average fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio falling by 485 basis points to 10.2% by 2023. MPS was the worst performing bank in the bloc, with its Tier 1 capital ratio being wiped out by 2023 under the worst-case scenario. The ratio for Intesa Sanpaolo fell by 466 basis points to 9.4%; UniCredit's fell by 592 basis points to 9.2%; Banco BPM's ratio fell by 622 basis points to 7%, and that of Mediobanca fell by 478 basis points to 9.7%.
- The resilience of the financial sector will be severely tested by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, followed by the cost-of-living and energy crises and the Russia-Ukraine war. An array of policy support by the ECB, as well as domestic stimulus measures by the government and the Bank of Italy (the central bank), has helped to bolster liquidity and hold down banks' funding costs. However, an increase in loan losses amid higher unemployment and business failures and bouts of global financial market volatility will put pressure on lenders' balance sheets, potentially exposing areas of weakness and curbing lending as the economy recovers. Lenders could benefit from rising interest rates as the ECB gradually tightens monetary policy. Italy's large number of small and medium-sized firms will continue to rely heavily on bank borrowing for financing.

Past reforms will reduce long-standing rigidities only gradually Italy's global ranking deteriorates by eight places in the forecast period, as we expect the country to continue to perform poorly in the labour market category, especially compared with its EU peers. The Jobs Act legislative package that was passed in 2014-15 was a welcome development, but, because the main reforms only apply to new private-sector hires, it will reduce long-standing rigidities only gradually. Having promised to dismantle the Jobs Act, the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government made limited changes to it in its so-called Dignity Decree. Restrictions on the use of easily terminated fixed-term contracts were tightened, allowing them to be used for up to 24 months, compared with 36 months under the Jobs Act. It also required firms to provide justification for the use of such contracts, which is likely to have increased litigation, and pay an additional levy of 1.9% (up from 1.4%) when they extended a fixed-term contract. However, the cap of 20% of the workforce on temporary contracts for an individual firm remained unchanged. The decree also raised the minimum compensation for unfair dismissal from four months' salary to six months' and from a maximum of 24 months' salary to 36. Other measures introduced under the Jobs Act that remain intact include reduced employment protection for long-term contracts and a much simplified contract system for labour market entrants that introduced a standard open-ended employment contract with gradually increasing protection. The Jobs Act also increased the availability of unemployment benefits and streamlined the use of wage guarantee funds for temporary lay-offs or firm restructuring. The new national agency envisaged under the Jobs Act to co-ordinate the activities of all employment services providers became operative in 2018. Labour market reform is a major component of Italy's NRRP. However, rather than focus on contracts, as past reforms have largely done, it will seek to improve job activation schemes, as well as the retraining and up-skilling of workers, increasing the effectiveness of the national employment agency and improving education outcomes.
Reforms will focus on job activation, training and the employment agency
- The shortcomings that persist in the Italian labour market left it particularly vulnerable to severe economic and social disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Given the scale of the damage to the economy and the time-limited nature of state-backed schemes to protect jobs, unemployment levels are likely to rise again as support is withdrawn and the impact of the cost-of-living and energy crises grows. The effects are likely to vary significantly across different sectors of the economy and the labour force. Tourism, travel and hospitality were among the worst hit by the pandemic, but firms are struggling to fill vacancies as activity recovers. Low-skilled, low-paid temporary contract workers, women and young people are also likely to have been badly affected.
- Italy's headline jobless rate was relatively high even before the coronavirus pandemic hit. At 10% in 2019, the unemployment rate was well above the euro area average of 7.6%. Government support helped to limit the damage inflicted by the pandemic, but at 8.1% in June 2022 unemployment was still well above the euro area average of 6.6%, and youth unemployment remained high at 23.1%, the third highest in the euro area, where the average rate was 13.6%. Italian labour market participation also remains low, particularly among women and young people, and fell sharply during the pandemic. Italy's employment rate was 59.1% in the first quarter of 2022, back to its pre-pandemic average of 59% in 2019 but well below the euro area average of 68.9%. The female employment rate averaged 50.1% in the first quarter of 2022 (64.2% in the euro area).
- M5S's flagship citizenship income scheme, which aimed to reduce poverty, was established in 2019. However, concerns persist that it acts as a disincentive for people out of work to search for employment, resulting in higher structural unemployment. The collapse of the Draghi government has halted plans to amend the scheme to boost employment as well as plans to introduce a minimum wage in Italy. We expect sectoral wage bargaining between unions and employers' associations at a national level to continue to determine wage levels and employment conditions. Negotiations can be protracted, however, resulting in many contracts expiring well before they can be renewed. The social partners agreed in 2018 to implement second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains, but progress in this area was halted during the pandemic.

Infrastructure quality in the south will continue to lag the rest of the country As reflected in Italy's relatively low score in this category and its decline in the global and regional rankings, the quality of its infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment over the past 25-30 years, and corruption investigations and opposition from local interest groups have been a relatively common reason for blocking or delaying several major projects. Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in the transport and energy sectors, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow. As illustrated by the collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in 2018, maintenance of existing infrastructure also remains an issue. However, the reconstruction of the bridge in record time (it reopened in July 2020) highlights that when there is political will to overcome bureaucratic obstacles there is ample scope for improvement in Italy's performance.

- Successive governments have promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt-servicing costs, combined with competing demands within coalition governments, have made a radical change in policy direction difficult. Backed by EU recovery funds, the Draghi government's NRRP has focused on a wide range of infrastructure investments in areas such as sustainable energy and transport, as well as in the digital economy, including the deployment of ultra-fast broadband, and fifth-generation (5G) and satellite technology. It remains to be seen how effective implementation and monitoring of the investments will be after the collapse of the government.

Implementing major investments in the NRRP will be challenging
- Limited domestic energy sources, popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation and the Ukraine crisis will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution will also keep upward pressure on costs in the medium term. Investment projects in the sector are also likely to continue to face strong local resistance.
- Building a high-speed broadband network across the country has been a policy priority of successive Italian governments. Progress has been extremely slow so far, but the NRRP's focus on the need to accelerate Italy's digital transition may provide some much-needed momentum. Central to the government's plan has been Open Fiber, a wholesale broadband operator that is jointly owned by Enel and CDP. At end-May 2022 Open Fiber and Telecom Italia signed a preliminary agreement to merge their network assets. The merger should help to accelerate the high-speed broadband rollout and avoid unnecessary duplication. The talks between the two companies have been fractious, and there is concern that a merger will stifle competition.

Italy's technological readiness score and rankings improve in the forecast period, partly driven by measures contained in the NRRP. During the pandemic growth in e-commerce accelerated (up by 34.8% year on year in value terms in 2020 and by 13.3% in 2021, according to Istat). However, this has been from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales (compared with about 20% in the UK).

- Mobile-phone penetration is among the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive. Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D), has risen gradually since the beginning of the 2000s but is low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. Total R&D spending was the equivalent of 1.5% of GDP in 2020 (compared with an OECD average of 2.5%), according to the OECD.

Digitalisation of public services is a policy priority
- We expect a slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base. According to the European Patent Office, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy rose by 6.5% in 2021-compared with an annual average increase of 2.8% in Europe as a whole-but accounted for only 3% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at 81.5 per million population, ranking Italy 18th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany, and France but on a par with the UK and well ahead of Spain.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Since mid-2021 the Draghi government has adopted several packages of measures to address the impact of rising energy costs, particularly higher electricity and fuel prices. So far, the cost to the national budget has been about EUR25bn, with new measures reported to cost a further EUR8bn-8.5bn. However, according to the government, this will be covered by a windfall tax of 25% on the increased profits of energy companies. In early July the government approved a new decree, which is currently being discussed in parliament and is expected to include an extension up to the beginning of October, of the 25% excise duty cut on fuel and electricity prices due to expire in August, as well as the continuation of the tax rebate for higher energy costs incurred by businesses.
The Draghi government has managed to pass most of the reforms contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan through parliament. The plan was approved by the European Commission in mid-2021, allowing the government to access EUR191.5bn in EU grants and loans in 2021-26 (about 9.6% of GDP). The main pillars of the plan aim to reform the tax system, the public administration and the justice system. The next administration will have to fulfil the policy commitments agreed with the EU to receive the remaining disbursements from the EU recovery fund.
Reform implementation is likely to remain patchy but sufficient to continue receiving disbursements. In July 2021 the lower house of parliament approved changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems, designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases. However, political opposition and resistance to change remain strong in the judicial system. In October 2021 the government approved a draft bill setting the framework for a broad tax reform that aims to simplify the system, curbing tax evasion and eliminating a series of "micro-taxes" that make the system extremely complex, while easing the income tax burden on the middle classes. However, the timeline for approval is long, and after the bill is approved by parliament it must be implemented within 18 months.

The covid-19 crisis led to a substantial deterioration in the public finances. The budget deficit widened to 9.6% of GDP in 2020, from 1.5% of GDP in 2019. The public debt/GDP ratio increased by more than 20 percentage points in 2020, to about 155% (the second highest in the euro zone after Greece). The budget deficit narrowed to 7.2% of GDP in 2021 (below the government's target of 9.4%). The deficit will narrow further in 2022, both in nominal terms and as a share of GDP, while remaining large, at 6.1% of GDP (slightly above the government's target of 5.6%), given the need for additional stimulus measures to mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine on the Italian economy. EIU forecasts that the deficit will narrow gradually to 2.9% of GDP in 2026, with public debt falling to about 144% of GDP.

Surging inflation is forcing the ECB to adopt a more aggressive approach. Inflation across the euro zone reached 8.9% year on year in July, well above the ECB's target of 2%, and will remain elevated well into 2023. At its most recent monetary policy meeting on July 21st the ECB raised its policy rates by 50 basis points, twice the size of the increase that had been previously signalled, citing rising upward risks to inflation, including a sharp depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. More concerned about being credible than predictable, the ECB ditched its previous policy of "forward guidance" and indicated a shift to a "meeting by meeting" approach. The ECB remains more worried about spiralling inflation than slowing economic growth, and is ready to tolerate tighter financing conditions even if the euro zone enters a recession. We therefore expect the ECB to act decisively in front-loading rate increases, raising its rates by an additional 50 basis points in September and October, 25 points in December, and 25 points in 2023, with short-term rates settling between 1.5% and 2%, in line with current estimates for neutral rates in the euro zone.
Financing conditions will tighten in 2022-23. Higher bond yields will raise debt-servicing costs, especially in highly indebted south European economies, but the region's debt sustainability is not at risk, as strong nominal GDP growth will put debt/GDP ratios on a downward trajectory. Moreover, the ECB has announced the creation of a new anti-fragmentation tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument. Subject to the fulfilment of specific criteria, the ECB will be able to make secondary-market purchases of securities issued in euro area countries that are experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not justified by country-specific fundamentals. This will supplement the other instrument the ECB can use against the widening of yield spreads: the reinvestment of redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which will be conducted in a flexible way and continue until at least end-2024.

Following a contraction of 9.1% in 2020, Italy's real GDP rebounded by 6.6% in 2021, making it one of the surprise performers in Europe last year, considering its dismal growth record since 1990. We expect economic activity to remain solid in 2022, expanding by 3%. An expansionary fiscal policy and strong fixed investment due to EU recovery funds will partly compensate for the growth headwinds posed by the war in Ukraine. Having slowed to just 0.1% in the first quarter of 2022, quarterly real GDP growth accelerated to 1% in April-June. In year-on-year terms real GDP expanded by 5.4% on average in January-June. However, the headwinds to growth are strong, including the cost-of-living and energy crises, tightening financing conditions and increased domestic political instability. The impact of these factors is likely to be felt more acutely in the second half of 2022 and in 2023.
The Italian economy will tip into a recession in the winter of 2022/23, and output will contract by 1.3% on average in 2023. We now believe that Russian gas flows to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline will fluctuate between zero and 20% capacity in the coming months, resulting in a recession in Germany and most of central Europe over the winter of 2022/23. Italy has a high reliance on Russian gas (40% previously, now reduced to 25% owing to higher imports from Algeria, Azerbaijan and elsewhere). Italy's access to other pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure, and high levels of gas reserves mean that it is less vulnerable to gas shortages in the winter of 2022/23 than central Europe. Rationing is therefore likely to be more limited (Italy will have to cut gas consumption by about 7%) but still likely. The productive but energy-intensive mechanical and metallurgy sectors in the north of the country are most exposed to gas shortages. In terms of indirect effects, the main impact will come through high energy prices, falling confidence and weak external trade. Italy has a high reliance on imported gas and will be hit hard by higher gas prices, which will erode households' purchasing power, weighing on consumer demand and private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of GDP. The Italian economy is also exposed to a recession in Germany via the trade channel (Germany is Italy's main trade partner). Gas rationing, high input costs and weaker external demand will weigh on Italy's industrial output.
In 2024-26 growth will remain above the pre-crisis trend, supported by EU-funded recovery investment. However, real GDP will not return to its end-2019 level before 2025.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In 2020 industry (excluding construction) accounted for 23.6% of nominal gross value added, compared with 27.7% in 2007, although it rebounded to 25.1% in 2021. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, concerns about the global economic outlook due to the impact of the war in Ukraine and China's "zero-covid" policy on global supply-chains and commodity prices, and an expected slowdown in global trade in 2023. Italy and its biggest trading partner, Germany, are exposed to gas rationing in the winter of 2022-23, as a result of a cut-off in Russian gas flows, which will further weigh on industrial production.
Italian industry faces major challenges owing to structural deficiencies In 2021 manufacturing accounted for 17% of gross value added, down from 17.5% in 2007 and 18.6% in 1996. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Unit labour costs have remained well above the euro area average since 2005 and have continued to rise in Italy since 2010, whereas they have fallen in other peripheral euro area economies such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP-almost a quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services.
Prior to 2021, vehicle production in Italy had been declining since 2018. It fell by about 15% to 777,000 units at end-2020, well below its 2007 levels. The drop in production disproportionately affected passenger-car output. In 2013 passenger-car output was more than 70% lower than in 2000, and production has been contracting sharply since 2018. This has been mainly due to the introduction of new EU emissions standards in 2019 that distorted industry statistics, and to the coronavirus-related restrictions in 2020, which slashed demand for motor vehicles in Europe and forced most automakers in the region to halt production temporarily. In 2020 the Italian government announced new purchase incentives for low-emission cars, and hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs). From August to December 2020 buyers of Euro 6 vehicles costing less than EUR40,000 will receive a subsidy of EUR3,500, instead of EUR1,500 previously, if they trade in cars older than ten years. Pure EVs costing less than EUR61,000 will also get a discount of EUR6,000, compared with EUR4,000 earlier. The 2021 Budget Law allocates EUR250m to car incentives. This helped car production to rebound slightly to 795,860 units at end-2021, up by 2% year on year.
Manufacturing sector performance will depend on the speed of reforms In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as a lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities. This has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation, and research and development (R&D) has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often aggregated within sector-specific industrial districts, which, through a combination of co-operation and competition, helps to mitigate the impact of the difficulties arising from a lack of expansion. Italian SMEs have begun to consolidate under the pressure of intense competition and the global financial crisis. However, the availability of domestic funds to support mergers or recapitalisations to start new projects is likely to be curtailed by the need to reduce the government debt burden.
Construction sector activity is likely to rebound in 2022-26, owing to incentives Activity in the construction sector accounted for 5.1% of gross value added in 2021, up from 4.4% on average in 2015-20 but well below an annual average of 6% in 2006-09. We expect the sector to perform relatively well in 2022-25 compared with recent years, mainly owing to construction-related economic stimulus measures introduced since the pandemic. The "superbonus" scheme allows homeowners a tax deduction of up to 110% on expenses related to property renovation. This can be used in conjunction with the "sismabonus" and "ecobonus" to reduce seismic risk and make energy-efficiency upgrades. However, an economic recession in 2023 and tightening monetary policy conditions will weigh on the outlook for next year.
Services will be significantly disrupted by the pandemic Accounting for about 73% of gross value added, the services sector will continue to rebound following covid-related disruptions. We expect the tourism sector to continue to recover in 2022. We do not expect international travel arrivals to return to 2019 levels until 2023. The retail sector also suffered in 2020-21. In contrast, the information and communications technology (ICT) sector has benefited from the increase in remote working, and we expect a continued rise in its share of real value added. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, that are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotive-Italy's main export sectors-should continue to perform well, despite production in some sectors increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are lower.

Economic forecast: Inflation % 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Consumer price inflation (av; EU harmonised measure) 1.9 7.2 4.0 2.2 1.8 1.6

Labour costs per hour (US$) 35.1 32.5 35.1 37.6 39.4 40.5
Italian consumer price inflation (by the EU harmonised measure) slowed marginally to 8.4% year on year in July, owing to a moderation in energy costs (which still increased by 43% on an annual basis). Given Italy's heavy dependence on imported oil and gas, the Italian economy is more exposed than most in the EU to the ongoing global energy price shock. However, inflationary pressures are becoming more broad-based (core inflation reached 4.1% in July, a 26-year high). We forecast that EU harmonised inflation will average 7.2% in 2022, before slowing to 4% in 2023 and 1.9% on average in 2024-26.

The euro has depreciated sharply against the US dollar since the start of 2022, reaching parity for the first time in 20 years in mid-July. This reflects increased investor concerns in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a growing divergence between the monetary policy stances of the ECB and the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank), with the Fed tightening monetary policy more aggressively. In the remainder of 2022 we expect the euro to partly recover against the dollar as the ECB front-loads interest-rate increases, closing the year at about US$1.09:EUR1. However, the euro area's bleaker growth outlook and a considerably slower pace of monetary tightening than in the US will continue to weigh on the value of the single currency in the short term. We expect a more sustained appreciatory trend to begin in 2023, when the interest-rate differential with the US will narrow. Over the medium term the value of the euro will continue to be supported by a structural current-account surplus.

We expect Italy's current-account surplus to shrink to 0.3% of GDP in 2022, from 2.5% in 2021, as a result of a decline in the trade surplus, owing to higher energy prices following the outbreak of war in Ukraine (Italy is heavily dependent on energy imports). The current-account surplus will widen gradually in 2023-26, while remaining well below pre-war levels. A subdued external environment and high gas prices in 2023, and a rebound in domestic demand in the following years will constrain the expansion of the trade surplus in 2023-26. We expect this trend to be mitigated to some extent by a recovery in earnings from international tourism, as well as by the disbursement of EU recovery funds recorded on the secondary income account.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy Stocks and flows Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows declined to almost zero in 2012, owing to large disinvestments, before recovering moderately in 2013-17, averaging US$17.3bn per year (0.9% of GDP). Inward FDI rose by almost 300% to US$44.2bn in 2018 (equivalent to 2.1% of GDP), before dropping back to US$31.2bn in 2019 (equivalent to 1.6% of GDP) amid political volatility. Net inflows contracted in 2020 to negative US$22bn, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, and remained negative in 2021 (US$3.6bn), with inward FDI rebounding to US$14.3bn (0.7% of GDP). Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$607bn in 2021, about 60% of total FDI in France, a third of that in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. In relation to GDP, the stock of FDI was 28.9% in 2021, lower than in every other EU country except Greece. FDI outflows have also generally been small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy. In 2005-09 Italy recorded substantial outward FDI flows as a result of several major investments abroad in the banking and energy sectors. A similarly large outflow, of about US$52bn, was recorded in 2011, the year that the Italian car manufacturer Fiat bought the US Treasury's remaining stake in Chrysler.
Origin and distribution FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2020, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from the Netherlands (US$63.4bn), Spain (US$40bn), Germany (US$35.7bn) and France (US$30.5bn), although FDI from the Netherlands is likely to reflect investment originating from other countries using the Netherlands as a conduit.
Determinants The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$45,755 at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2021. Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted typical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-technology investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact According to the Italian Trade and Investment Agency (ITA), foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and a half times more in research and development (R&D) than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central and northern Italy in GDP per head terms (at less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times higher than that in the north.
Potential The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period (2022-26) will be hampered by the uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine and the prospect of a recession in 2023, and by the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega administration implemented a less friendly policy stance towards foreign investment, marginally tightening labour contract regulations through its so-called Dignity Decree in 2018, and enforcing penalties on foreign firms that take advantage of government investment incentives and then divest or relocate production to other markets. Over the forecast period a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's need to reduce its dependence on imported energy, there could be potential for investment in the still state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources. Political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature. Banking sector reforms may increase opportunities for foreign investment in smaller Italian banks.

The population is projected to decline further Having declined for several years in the late 1990s, Italy's total population increased moderately in 1999-2017, rising by an average of 0.4% per year. Since then the population has started to decline again, to 59.5m in 2020, according to the UN's population estimates. This has been mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population, which has outpaced immigration. In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic also put downward pressure on Italy's death and birth rates, and on immigrant arrivals. The number of births in Italy was the lowest recorded since the country's unification in 1861, and the death toll was the highest recorded in any year since the second world war. Italy's immigrant population dropped significantly to about 80,000 on that year, or about 1.3 per 1,000 residents-about half the rate of arrivals in 2019. In 2021 Italy's total population dropped by 4.3 per thousand on annual basis-still an improvement compared to 2020. The birth rate was at an all-time low, while mortality remained high but fell compared with 2020. Italy's migration inflows recovered in 2021; the net balance was 157,000, equal to 2.7 per thousand inhabitants, almost double that in 2020 and higher than in 2019. EIU forecasts that the population will fall over the long term, in line with falling birth rates and despite an expected increase in migration inflows.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population increased from 4.5% in 2005 to 8.8% at end-2019, and has decreased marginally to 8.4% since then. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for more than 10% of the population at end-2019. The five largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians, Moroccans, Chinese and Ukrainians (which have arrived in larger numbers since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February-about 141,000 as at July), which together account for about 50% of the total number of foreign residents.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market. The steady rise in the employment rate (the percentage of people aged 20-64 in employment) since the mid-1990s came to a halt in 2008. According to Eurostat, the employment rate stood at 62.3% in 2016, just below the 62.9% rate in 2008 but 10 percentage points lower than the EU28 average and the third-lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 will gradually address some of these issues during the forecast period (2022-26). In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will reflect greater female participation and pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement.
The rise in the proportion of the elderly will put pressure on pensions During the forecast period the number of people reaching working age will be considerably lower than the number of people reaching 65. As a result, Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) will rise further. At 35% in 2021, it is already the highest in the EU. This trend, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending has been on a steadily rising trend and is among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP. According to figures from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, public pension spending is projected to decline gradually over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% in 2013-14, owing to a series of reforms introduced since the beginning of the 1990s. However, costs could decline less markedly or even rise owing to the lingering effects of a partial rollback in 2018 by the previous M5S-Lega government of the 2011 Fornero pension reform, the most recent effort to improve the social-security system's sustainability.

Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of about 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
Cost-consciousness will remain an important consumer trend In 2020 consumer sentiment and spending were constrained by the practical disruptions caused by measures enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as well as by a sharp rise in unemployment. In 2020 retail sales volumes were down by 6.2% compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall on record. Supported by the steady rollout of the vaccination programme, the release of pent-up demand and high levels of savings accumulated during successive lockdowns, retail sales volume growth rebounded by 7% year on year in 2021. However, even if the Italian economy recovers further in 2022, consumer activity is likely to remain constrained by the ongoing cost-of living crisis, which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Many customers will remain cautious in the near term, given the deteriorating economic outlook.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU28 average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at an estimated US$45,755 in 2021. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 46% of that in the north. Development policies over the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 18%-just above the level in France, but significantly above that in the Netherlands (about 15%), Germany (13.9%) and the UK (12%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period (2021-25), largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low, and interest rates on consumer loans have declined but are expected to increase gradually in 2022-26, which will raise the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock. Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to be introduced in order to meet budgetary targets.

Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor over the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. As well as undergoing severe fiscal consolidation during the 1990s in order to join the euro area, which dampened growth in that decade, the Italian economy has suffered from a steady loss of competitiveness owing to low productivity growth and rising unit labour costs (reflecting falling output, despite wage moderation since 1993)-in contrast to the situation in its main trading partners.
The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's com-petitiveness substantially. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. This will hold back capital spending in the medium to long term. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment in 2020, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Unfavourable demographic trends will weigh on long-term growth Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration will be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population over the long-term forecast period (2022-50). We expect Italy's labour market participation rate to rise from the current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age. However, it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72%) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 0.9% in 2022-50.
External conditions: Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. Small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-technology sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D, innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic ''Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short lived. Some reforms have been introduced since the financial turmoil of late 2011. However, popular and political resistance to reform halted the Renzi government's attempt to overhaul Italy's institutional framework in 2014-16, taking institutional change off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. A more comprehensive system of unemployment protection envisaged under the 2012 and 2014 reforms could help to enhance labour mobility, but there may be a lack of resources. Without more drastic cuts in public spending on pensions, this will now rise again until late 2040. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government partially rolled back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which will lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth Long-term performance: EIU's baseline forecast is that Italian real GDP growth will average 0.8% per year in 2022-50. The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2019 fell from 107% of the EU28 average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy, and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is expected to have a moderate, but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, especially among the country's growing elderly population. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such as citrus fruits and wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination and a regional capital, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure. EIU's model to evaluate the impact of climate change on long-term growth finds that the Italian economy will be 2.8% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0" or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the internet of things, cloud technologies, or "big data" analytics. The share rises sharply in firms with 250 or more employees, to about 47%, compared with 6% for firms with fewer than ten employees. In 2017 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.35% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile, the trade balance of high-technology goods stood at -0.54% of GDP in 2015 (latest data available). Since 2016 a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, and higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. EIU's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows the EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by the EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2017-21) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2022-26). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by the EIU for 2017-21. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2022-26 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2017-21 ranges are then used to derive 2022-26 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2022-26, not to the likely situation in 2026 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2019 or 2024). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Political volatility will increase in the run-up to and the aftermath of the next election, due to be held no later than early 2023. The unpopularity of the incumbent military-aligned coalition under the leadership of the Phalang Pracharat (PP) party and the prime minister (and coup leader), Prayuth Chan-ocha, means that the opposition is likely to make major gains, although the tilted political landscape could still allow the pro-military parties to form a government. EIU does not expect the return of massive and sustained student-led protests; demonstrations will remain too modest in scale to oust the incumbent or future pro-military governments. In any case, after 2023 the royalist-military alliance will maintain its strong influence on Thai politics.

- Thailand's business environment score improves in 2022-26. However, faster progress elsewhere means that its global ranking has fallen by four places to 42th, from 38th in 2017-21. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The higher overall score reflects minor improvement in a number of subcategories. Thailand's score for policy towards foreign investment will improve as the government rolls out incentives and liberalises the regulatory regime, partly via the implementation of multinational trade agreements, to attract much-needed foreign investors. Likewise, EIU expects an improvement in the market opportunities category as household income and, therefore, domestic demand resume a steady growth trajectory after 2022. An anticipated acceleration of infrastructure projects, including in digitalisation and 5G, will also boost Thailand's scores for infrastructure and technological readiness.

- We expect Thailand's real GDP to expand by an average of 3.3% per year in 2022-26. The post-pandemic rebound will only be fully realised in 2023, as tourism will remained curtailed in 2022 by the pandemic. The growth rate will become steady but will remain slower than before the pandemic. It will take until early 2023 for the economy to recover to its pre-pandemic level of output. Growth will rely more heavily on public investment and the external sector as household spending stagnates. The tourism sector will return to pre-pandemic levels only in early 2024, as travel restrictions are likely remain in China throughout 2022-23.

Population growth   0.3 0.1
Working-age population growth   -0.1 -0.6
Labour force growth   0.2 -0.2

- The rate of population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families. Improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to a longer life expectancy and an ageing population; this will put a burden on healthcare provision. Migrant labour from Cambodia, Laos and especially Myanmar, after the junta seized power there, will grow in absolute terms after a slump in 2021-22 amid pandemic-related travel restrictions, but the overall labour force is still expected to contract. Foreign workers will play a more prominent role in Thailand's labour market during the latter part of the forecast period, as the trend of a declining domestic workforce persists amid a marked increase in the elderly population compared with its peers.

- Thailand is a sizeable market, with a population of nearly 72m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$505.8bn (at market exchange rates) in 2021. As with the broader economy, the retail sector will resume a steady growth trajectory from 2023. However, household debt will continue to dampen consumer sentiment in the forecast period. The continued rise of e-commerce and digital payments will irrevocably change consumers' habits and create new market opportunities at the expense of traditional bricks-and-mortar stores.

- Thailand's long-term outlook hinges on the assumption that governments in the next ten years will prove capable of enacting structural reforms and upgrading infrastructure. There will be persistent challenges owing to an inefficient bureaucracy, political deadlock and a tourism-oriented economy. Without such reforms, Thailand's growth will consistently fall well below its potential and lag behind regional neighbours. In later decades, Thailand's unfavourable demographic profile and the impact of climate change will also affect GDP growth and political stability.

Background: Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Although the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent and has subsequently been subject to 19 coups. The latest took place in 2014, when the democratically elected government, led by Yingluck Shinawatra, was removed following months of political turmoil. Yingluck's older brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, another elected prime minister, had been removed in a coup in 2006. Thaksin was a populist leader, and his political standing created a divide between the rural population, particularly in the north-eastern provinces, and the urban population-a lasting feature of Thai democracy. A return in 2019 to a limited form of democracy, led by military-aligned parties, is likely to renew rivalry between the two camps.
Political structure: Following the recent transition from junta administration to nominally civilian government, parliament takes the form of a bicameral National Assembly, consisting of an elected 500-seat House of Representatives (the lower house) and a 250-seat Senate (the upper house) appointed by the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). The prime minister is appointed by the National Assembly, and King Maha Vajiralongkorn remains the symbolic head of state.
Policy issues: The government will continue to prioritise reviving the economy in the short term, amid the protracted fallout from the pandemic. It will return to its focus on improving the investment environment in Thailand, which will include the acceleration of a planned infrastructure upgrade, to facilitate the country's economic breakthrough in the longer term. This emphasis on long-term policy continuity should reassure many foreign investors deterred by potential political instability, but growing regional competition will detract from Thailand's attractiveness as an investment destination.
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stock market. Value-added tax (VAT) stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$150,000). As the economy reopens, one-off waivers and the deferral of tax payments introduced during the pandemic in 2020-21 have been largely phased out.
Foreign trade: Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (fob-fob) of US$40bn in 2021, remaining on a par with US$40.8bn in 2020. However, a rare deficit on the services account resulted in an overall current-account deficit of US$10.6bn, compared to a substantial surplus of US$20.3bn in 2020.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance A military-aligned civilian government assumed power in July 2019, following the election held in March. The government consists of an 18-party coalition led by the Phalang Pracharat (PP), with a former general and coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, as prime minister. Following the turbulent events surrounding the dissolution of the second-largest opposition party, Future Forward Party (FFP), in February 2020 and subsequent defections, the coalition cemented its hold on power, and this has remained intact despite frequent factional in-fighting, including a split in the PP in January 2022, and the return of student-led protests in 2020-21. Prior to the 2019 election, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO, the military junta) had ruled Thailand since the coup of 2014, and the military continues to exercise substantial political influence through a constitution drafted by its members in 2016-17. The legislature comprises a 250-seat Senate (upper house) appointed by the military and endorsed by the king, and a 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house) elected democratically. These features will incline future governments to be aligned with the junta's preferences. Nonetheless, the military's power is not entirely unchecked, made evident by the fact that PP governs in a fractious coalition with a long tradition of jockeying for positions within government. The lower house also includes a sizeable anti-junta opposition (led by Puea Thai, the party of two former prime ministers-and siblings-Yingluck and Thaksin Shinawatra, and the Move Forward Party, which is a continuation of the now-disbanded FFP).

King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who was formally crowned in May 2019, will oversee stability in the monarchy. Although the king will remain removed from day-to-day politics, he will adopt a more centralised style of leadership than that of his revered late father. Throughout the forecast period, the military will continue to look to (and defend) the monarchy to legitimise its own political role as the mutually beneficial royalist-military alliance, which has dominated the country's politics since the coup in 2014, endures. Nonetheless, the king's prominent place in Thai society will diminish in the medium term, as the new monarch-stung further by criticism about his performance during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic-fails to command the same level of reverence among the public that his father did.

Political outlook: Political stability EIU believes that the military will retain strong political influence in the forecast period. Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader who is supported by the Phalang Pracharat (PP) party, will serve out his four-year term as prime minister, ending in 2023, despite questions over the constitutionality of his serving more than eight years in the post. However, the risk of the ruling party not selecting Prayuth as its candidate for prime minister in the 2023 election has risen, following three by-election defeats in January 2022 and a heavy loss in the gubernatorial election in the capital, Bangkok, in May; the results reflect a decline in his popularity. It is still unclear who would be the most likely alternative candidate for PP. Under Thailand's constitution, the prime minister is not required to be a member of parliament but must be approved by a parliamentary majority. If Prayuth opts out, the field for his replacement as PP's candidate is wide open.
As the general election due in 2023 approaches, student-led protests could resume, causing local disturbance for businesses. However, they would not result in the removal of Prayuth's government or democratic reforms that would loosen the tight grip on power held by royalists and the military. Protests will centre on similar demands to those in 2020: constitutional amendment and an end to the harassment of the government's critics. Reform of the monarchy and an end to the draconian lese-majesty law could also feature.
Our baseline forecast is that the protest movement will not seriously disrupt the basic functioning of public institutions. We do not expect any major constitutional reform to be introduced ahead of the next general election. Crucially, there is no sign of a split in the alliance between the military and the royal establishment, which has been influential in Thailand's politics for years. With strong command over the security and legal apparatus, the government will continue to keep protest leaders and other critics in check through legal means. Under such circumstances, the risk of a crackdown by force will also persist over 2022-26.
In terms of day-to-day governance, stability will be maintained. The ruling coalition will hold until the end of its term, despite growing internal disputes and the opposition's attempt to launch a no-confidence motion before the next general election. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, on the throne since 2016, will not exert the same stabilising influence as his revered father, although the military establishment will continue to depend on royal endorsement for its political legitimacy and will suppress criticism of the monarch.
The localised insurgency in the three Muslim-dominated southern provinces will continue in the form of small-scale attacks on the security forces. However, this presents only a minimal threat to overall political stability.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness will be underpinned by policy continuity under the auspices of the junta-drafted constitution of 2016-17. In particular, the incumbent and future governments' ability to pass and implement legislation will be supported by the constitutionally mandated 20-year "National Strategy"-a blueprint for develop-ment devised by the junta. Until the next election (to be held no later than early 2023), the current pro-military government will continue to possess expanded unilateral executive and legislative power through the emergency decree issued in 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Prayuth still enjoys a comfortable majority in the lower house despite the recent expulsion of a rival faction from PP in January 2022, following a series of defections from the opposition in 2020. Nonetheless, frequent disputes and factional struggles within the coalition on issues outside the National Strategy could return to stall major policies after the end of the pandemic-related emergency decree in the latter part of our forecast period, made evident by the delayed passage of previous budgets.
Threats to government effectiveness will also arise from the vocal opposition, especially from the resilient street protests that have vehemently decried the military's continued grip on power. The anticipated alleviation of a protracted public health and related economic crisis in 2022-23 will lead to a return to more intense political confrontation as pent-up grievances among the opposition re-emerge in the run-up to the general election. Such grievances will focus largely on the government's handling of the pandemic and the economy remaining mired on a long and uncertain road to recovery. This will lead to instances of legislative gridlock and stymied policymaking. Later in the forecast period, a potential boycott of parliament, coinciding with the aforementioned street protests, could impede the government's ability to enact new legislation.
Nonetheless, PP, with an eye to the upcoming election, will devote significant resources to populist policies, in order to appease interest groups such as farmers and tourist operators, while simultaneously pursuing a pro-business push. The junta has made little progress in reconciling the longstanding political differences between the rural population of the north (who supported Thaksin) and the "elite" in southern Thailand (who are repre-sented by his detractors, the current establishment), as well as emerging calls from metropolitan youth for liberal democracy. The military-aligned government will consequently continue to find it difficult to satisfy the three major camps and may face rising opposition from multiple fronts in the medium term.
Political outlook: Election watch The exact date of the next general election, scheduled to be held in the first half of 2023, will probably be announced after Thailand hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Community (APEC) meeting in mid-November.
The gubernatorial election in Bangkok in May, which Chadchart Sittipunt, a transport minister in an earlier Puea Thai party (PTP) government, won by a landslide, is another sign that the government's handling of the economy remains unpopular, and indicates an edge for the opposition.
Following in-fighting within both the ruling coalition and the opposition, several new parties have been established, representing factions that split from the main parties. Nevertheless, alliances are still formed loosely around the pro-military and opposition camps. Within the opposition camp, there is a split between the PTP, which remains dominated by the Shinawatra family, and the Move Forward Party (MFP), which appeals more to younger voters through its left-leaning and anti-establishment stance.
Although we expect the opposition to make significant gains in the upcoming election, it is not clear that they can attain a clear majority in the House of Representatives (the lower house). There is also a pending amendment concerning the electoral system, which, in a reversal of the new law approved only last year by the governing coalition, would again favour smaller factions at the expense of big opposition parties. In addition, the military-aligned bloc still enjoys the advantage of a tilted political landscape that allows the appointed Senate (the upper house) to vote on the selection of the prime minister. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility that the military-aligned bloc may again string together a majority coalition, as it did in 2019, even if its flagship PP loses ground. In any case, we expect the royalist-military alliance to retain its strong influence on Thai politics in 2022-26. A truce between the PTP and the military-aligned bloc cannot be ruled out entirely, depending on the outcome of the election, but remains unlikely in our view.
Political outlook: International relations The partial return to democracy in 2019 has created more favourable circumstances for deeper ties with Western governments compared with the last period of junta rule in 2014-18. In the wake of the pandemic, developments will include the resumption of talks on an EU-Thailand free-trade agreement and more frequent high-profile visits by Western leaders. Meanwhile, Japan will also pursue a closer economic partnership, both bilaterally and through the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Thailand will stay engaged with the US and China; both superpowers have moved to pursue closer ties with the country as their rivalry intensifies. Thailand has indicated its willingness to join the fledgling Indo-Pacific Economic Framework championed by the US and will continue to adopt a neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, reflecting a desire to avoid being drawn into the conflict.
China's influence in Thailand will remain strong. With the countries having no conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea and a shared hardline stance against liberal opposition, economic ties are set to strengthen further. Thailand will focus on attracting Chinese investment under two flagship initiatives: "Thailand 4.0" and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC, a large special economic zone south-east of Bangkok). Contractual and financial issues will continue to delay the implementation of some of the more costly and long-term projects under these initiatives.
Bilateral co-operation with China will be accompanied by Thailand's ongoing efforts to engage with fellow member states of ASEAN on economic integration, including the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement, which took effect in January 2022.
The government will remain critical of the junta in Myanmar, but will refrain from undertaking measures such as economic sanctions. Inflows of Burmese citizens into Thailand will rise markedly, but will not be sufficient to destabilise the country or the wider region.

Thailand's overall score improves in 2022-26 as domestic economic conditions normalise following the lifting of coronavirus-related restrictions. Most categories have recorded an improvement in scores amid expectations that the government will return to its priority of strengthening the country's economic competitiveness. The notable exception is the macroeconomic environment category, which has been weighed down by a pandemic-induced deterioration of the traditionally strong indicators in Thailand's fiscal and current accounts. An improvement in the scores for market opportunities and technological readiness is noteworthy and bodes well for the country's medium-term attractiveness and prospects for the digital-isation of businesses. An improvement in the scores for infrastructure and policy towards foreign investment will encourage a moderate rise in investment in the medium term. Some relocation of supply chains to Thailand, amid persistent China-US tensions, will also provide a modest boost to manufacturing activity in the latter part of the forecast period. This will be aided by an open capital account and a relatively stable currency. The "Thailand 4.0" initiative, which entails an ambitious infrastructure upgrade, will proceed, but will growing challenges during the forecast period, as future construction projects to stimulate economic growth will be constrained by tighter fiscal space after the pandemic. Lacklustre domestic demand will remain a major drag on business sentiment. Rapid inflation (amid the war in Ukraine) and high household debt will weigh on private consumption prospects following the exhaustion of the immediate rebound from the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions.
The BOT will continue to raise the policy rates gradually in 2023 The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) will remain independent. Its governor, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, will have to strike a balance between reviving the economy and curbing inflation. This will translate into a gradual but longer monetary tightening cycle compared with those of its peers and the US.

Thailand's macroeconomic environment score declines from 7.8 in 2017-21 to 6.9 in 2022-26. This translates into a steep fall in the global ranking from 16th to 40th, and a fall in the regional ranking from 5th to 10th. Economic growth will accelerate from 2.9% in 2022 to an average of 3.4% in 2023-26. The relatively modest economic rebound lags behind other economies in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and its GDP will therefore be among the last in the region, barring Myanmar, to return to its pre-coronavirus level. Although almost all travel restrictions were lifted in July 2022, the tourism sector will continue to struggle until at least 2024, owing to a lack of arrivals from China, which will maintain its "zero-covid" policy throughout 2023. Ongoing tensions between the US and China, recurring lockdowns in major Chinese cities and the war in Ukraine will continue to fuel supply-chain disruption and inflation, which will dampen domestic consumption and investors' appetite for emerging economies such as Thailand. Weak recovery means that the Thai government will not be able quickly to bring down the swollen government debt, which has breached 60% of GDP.
The economy will return to its pre-pandemic size only in 2023
- The military will maintain a strong grip on economic affairs in 2022-26 and oversee the approval of major spending plans to stimulate the economy back to growth. The constitutionally mandated National Strategy (2018-37), the junta's 20-year blueprint for development, will undergo changes after an ongoing review by the government's National Economic and Social Development Council, with a stronger emphasis on generating tangible results in terms of job creation and GDP growth in the short term and strengthening the grass-roots economy in the longer term. This will include an acceleration of infrastructure projects and renewed commitments on the agriculture sector, where Thailand has traditionally been competitive, and the health sector. Strategy for the tourism sector will be tweaked towards targeting high-spending tourists amid the pandemic. The main objective of avoiding the middle-income trap will stay. The government will also ensure that business-oriented tax reform and investment incentives are maintained and expanded in 2022-26, and that major infrastructure investment projects continue beyond this period. In the early part of the forecast period, Chinese restrictions on outbound travel will slow the recovery of Thailand's tourism sector. Nonetheless, broad economic stability will be ensured by sound macroeconomic fundamentals, including a still-healthy current-account surplus and manageable levels of public debt. This will be helped by the normalisation of global economic conditions in 2022-26.
- The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) under its governor, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, will uphold its traditional credibility, as it remains relatively free from political pressure in setting policy rates and managing excess volatility in the local currency, the baht. It will balance the objectives of supporting economic recovery while preserving financial stability, which aligns with the economic agenda of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition in 2022-26 remains the same as in 2017-21. Thailand's global ranking falls from 32nd to 36th. However, the country's regional ranking will remain unchanged despite the slight improvements in the business conditions in other Asian countries.. Corruption and favouritism will continue to distort free-market dynamics, made evident by the slow progress of cases, despite the media attention that the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) has received in recent years. Big business groups with ties to the political elite retain a disproportionate influence on commercial affairs. Individuals with ties to military and political leaders tend to extract concessions from government and influence legal outcomes. Against this backdrop, the return to a quasi-civilian regime since the March 2019 election will not lead to any significant improvement in government accountability.
The pace of privatisation of SOEs will remain glacial in 2022-26
- Reforms to bolster the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been proposed in recent years, but the prospect of their implementation has grown even more remote in the wake of the pandemic. Any such reform would redistribute economic rents away from current holders. Privatisation remains a sensitive issue among both powerful interests and the public. It is unlikely that the military-aligned government will sell off state assets, especially after those assets have received government bail-outs and will probably remain at a discounted price for the foreseeable future. The continuation of price controls will distort competition in Thailand, as the government will maintain them for some basic goods to make them affordable.

Intellectual property infringement will remain an issue despite tougher laws
- Thailand has been on the US Trade Representative's lower-priority Watch List for intellectual property (IP) since 2017. Attempts to regulate intellectual property rights more effectively have led to the amended Copyrights Act, which came into effect in August 2022. This revised law extends the protection for photographic works to align with international standards, and strengthens reporting and enforcement mechanisms. Although the country has continued to make minor progress on matters related to patents and copyright legislation in recent years, instances of IP infringement remain relatively frequent. This comes from a combination of legislative and enforcement issues, such as Thailand's absence from the World Intellectual Property Organisation's (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, a limited level of punitive measures and patent application backlogs. As the country seeks to reinvent itself after the pandemic as a "digital economy", under its Thailand 4.0 initiative, we expect improve-ments in the legal apparatus that will offer greater protection for patent holders during the latter part of the forecast period. However, enforcement will remain flawed.

The score for policy towards foreign investment improves in 2022-26, raising both the country's regional and global rankings. Thailand will continue to encourage inward investment, especially in higher-value-added industries, as part of the Thailand 4.0 industrial policy. The Board of Investment (BOI) will continue to fast-track investment approvals. The government is keenly aware of intense competition for foreign investment and will prioritise improving the country's attractiveness. It will also decline to revive proposals to amend the Foreign Business Act, which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to control Thai entities unless they own a majority of shares.
The government will focus on attracting investment to "S-curve" sectors
- The BOI's Investment Promotion Strategy (2023-28) is slated to be completed in September 2022. The new strategy will focus on attracting investment to high-technology "S-curve" sectors and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC, a development initiative covering three eastern provinces). As part of the Thailand 4.0 policy, the scheme aims to galvanise 12 value-added sectors: next-generation automotive; high-value and medical tourism; biofuel and biochemical; defence; intelligent electronics; food for the future; aviation and logistics; digital; advanced agriculture and biotechnology; automation and robotics; medical and comprehensive healthcare; and education and human resource development. Leadership changes at the BOI could lead to changes in investment incentives.
- The Thai cabinet has approved a foreign land ownership programme. Effective from September 2022, the programme will allow foreigners to own up to 1 rai (0.16 ha) of land for residential purposes, on the condition that they invest Bt40m (US$1.1m) in selected Thai properties, funds and securities over the next three years. This scheme is aimed at attracting Bt800bn (US$22.9bn) in foreign investment between 2022 and 2026. The Ministry of Land will outline the regulations, with more details on qualification criteria and requirements.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls in 2022-26 remains the same as in 2017-21. Thailand's global ranking has dropped slightly to 29th, from 28th in 2017-21, and its regional ranking fell from 4th to 6th. Non-tariff barriers such as licensing and labelling requirements continue to impede trade. Authorities will be more likely to accommodate the demands of influential domestic groups, especially farmers, in 2022-23, with an approaching election and the expectation of a full recovery in major export markets. The government will be keen to diversify export markets and will continue to pursue trade agreements, both individually and in partnership with other ASEAN members.

- Meanwhile, the country will adhere to its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Thailand has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends. The central bank has eased restrictions on outward capital flows, and temporary measures to control capital inflows imposed in 2019 and early 2020 will not remain in effect amid the ongoing pandemic, as the country urgently seeks a return of foreign investors.
- Although the ASEAN Economic Community, the bloc's single market, had already led to the lifting of most tariffs and freer movement of services, investment and skilled labour (in eight selected sectors) since end-2015, a commensurate increase in customs regulations and non-tariff barriers continued to limit intra-regional trade. Phenomenal growth in services trade as a result of the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement is unlikely to materialise in 2022-26, or will, at best, be delayed to the later part of the forecast period.

RCEP will attract more investment into Thailand's competitive sectors.
- The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), effective since January 1st 2022, enables Thailand to diversify its import sources and export markets. RCEP's 40% rule-of-origin requirement allows the country to source inputs totalling up to 60% of the value of final goods from non-RCEP economies and to sell the final products duty-free within the bloc. The Investment Chapter adopts a negative list and abolishes performance requirements. These elements will spur investment into Thailand's most competitive sectors: automotive and electrical and electronics.
- The lifting of travel restrictions characterised by the elimination of the Thailand Pass since July 2022 will boost tourism and trade in services. Striving to revive the pandemic-battered tourism sector, the cabinet declared 2022-23 as "Visit Thailand Year" and will roll out measures to revitalise the industry.

Thailand's score in the taxes category increases marginally in 2022-26; the country's global and regional rankings maintain at 13th and 5th respectively. The marginal increase in the score is due to the implementation a new and fairer tax for property and land. Thailand's tax regime remains relatively simple, and changes have been made in recent years to reduce the overall burden on households and firms. The standard rate of corporate tax was reduced from 30% in 2011 to 20% in 2013. We expect it to remain at 20% during the forecast period, given the government's priority of attracting foreign investors. Personal income tax is also relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35% for Thai and foreign workers with annual earnings of more than Bt5m (US$145,000).
VAT will remain low at 7% until September 2023
- Successive governments have repeatedly postponed an increase in the rate of value-added tax (VAT) from 7% to 10%. The government has declared that it will maintain the current rate of 7% until September 2023. The authorities will raise the rate in 2023-24 as the need to plug the fiscal gap arising from a jump in expenditure in 2020-21 takes precedence. However, this decision will be influenced by the prevailing political climate, as such an increase could serve as a catalyst for protests. Attempting to spur growth in the digital asset industry, the cabinet has exempted trade in cryptocurrencies and digital assets on authorised digital asset exchanges from VAT until the end of 2023.
- From 2023 onwards, the government will opt to curtail spending growth, rather than raise taxes, to reduce the fiscal deficit. As a longer-term initiative, the government will make efforts to expand revenue collection. These will include measures to enable digital and mobile payments to broaden the tax base, as well as the imposition of capital gains tax later in the forecast period. Meanwhile the tax on property and land will be implemented in September 2022. It will have only a minor impact on foreign business, with the tax rates most applicable to foreign investors likely to be set at less than 2%.
- The new long-term resident visa scheme, effective from September 2022, aims to make Thailand a regional hub for living and working for foreigners under four categories: wealthy global citizens, wealthy pensioners, work-from-Thailand professionals and highly skilled professionals. This programme grants 10-year renewable visas to qualified individuals and their dependants. Qualified highly skilled professionals will pay a reduced personal income tax rate of 17%.
- The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty-Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) has been effective for Thailand since July 2022. MLI will reduce opportunities for profit-shifting and tax avoidance by multinational corporations.

Thailand will focus on containing the covid fallout on its financial stability. Thailand will focus on containing the fallout from the pandemic on its financial stability. Thailand's score for financing remains stable in 2022-26, as the banking sector has remained resilient in the face of headwinds from the pandemic-induced recession. However, Thailand's global ranking for the category falls from 25th to 35th, and its regional ranking drops marginally from eighth to ninth. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans remains relatively low, standing at 2.9% at end-March 2022. Although it has remained around this level since 2020, there is a substantial risk of rising NPLs when support measures are withdrawn. This will have a negative effect on the banking sector's asset quality and profitability, although the systemic risk is mitigated by the sector's ample capital adequacy and liquidity.

- The BOT and the Ministry of Finance will continue to focus on containing risks to the financial sector from the pandemic with a view to preserving financial stability. The central bank has extended its assistance to vulnerable groups, especially unsecured loans, until end-2023. NPLs will remain a threat to the profitability of banks during the latter part of the forecast period, especially those with a portfolio of mostly SMEs and individuals. The ongoing negotiations on liberalising banking services under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework will drag on amid the pandemic and will only be concluded towards the end of the forecast period. However, Thailand's pursuit of increasing interoperability across ASEAN markets-via the facilitation of local-currency settlement and standardised digitisation of payments-will progress more quickly.
- Thailand is working with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore to link the countries' QR code payment systems by November 2022. This will facilitate payments among these economies and enhance financing in the forecast period.
- The local bond market will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT. The bond market expanded by 6.6% to Bt15.1trn (US$432.7bn) in 2021, because of the introduction of the corporate bond stabilisation fund. Thailand's strong macroeconomic fundamentals and credible central bank, with a reputation for prudence, have made it ASEAN's largest local-currency bond market. Although government bonds continue to dominate the market, at 45% of total outstanding value, debt-laden large and medium-sized companies are increasingly using the bond market to refinance their bank loans and offshore borrowings.

Thailand's score and regional ranking in the labour market category remain unchanged in 2022-26, while its global ranking drops from 25th to 32nd; this reflects its waning competitiveness. The country is a labour-scarce economy and the official unemployment rate remains consistently low, which continued to hold true even amid the pandemic. The labour market will, in general, remain adequate in terms of supporting the operations of foreign-invested enterprises, but weaknesses-especially rising wage costs and skill shortages-will persist. Thailand's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production will vanish quickly amid growing competition from low-income neighbours such as Cambodia and Vietnam, which also happen to boast a large workforce.
A poorly skilled workforce will remain the biggest hurdle for "Thailand 4.0"
- Shortages of labour trained to work in high-value industries will continue to pose a huge problem for the government's Thailand 4.0 policy ambitions, which are premised on developing the country's advanced technology sectors. These skilled labour problems stem in large part from Thailand's under-performing education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally. Educational reforms in the last two decades have been poorly and inconsistently implemented, and there are currently still no plans for a major overhaul of the system. The ability of the labour force to meet the needs of businesses (in terms of specialist skills) is therefore likely to remain below global standards. In view of this situation, hiring skilled foreign workers will become easier, with the government set to relax visa restrictions during the forecast period, especially for the research and technology sectors. There is a urgent sense of the need to accelerate digital skills training among the labour force and students, but the skill upgrade process will take time to show results.
- From January 2017 the nationwide daily minimum-wage schedule was replaced by minimum wages by province. The range of the wage floor was raised to Bt313-336 (about US$10) with effect from January 2020. With an eye on the upcoming election, the government recently approved a substantial rise in the daily minimum wages for 16 professions in construction, industrial art and service sectors to up to Bt650, with effect from September 2022. Despite long-standing opposition in parliament and among business associations, owing to the effect it would have on private-sector costs and Thailand's regional competitiveness, we expect the government to succeed again in raising the minimum wage in 2022-26, as a populist measure to appease the working class. The cabinet approved the establishment of the National Pension Fund in early 2021, but a timeline for its implementation is still uncertain.
- Thailand is facing the social and economic consequences of a rapidly ageing society, including a steadily declining workforce as a share of the total population. Proposals advocating a staggered increase in the retirement age for civil servants-from 60 years to 63, with the option of delaying retirement in steps for up to ten years-have been postponed, but may still be implemented in the later part of the forecast period. The private sector has followed a more flexible rule on the retirement age since a court ruling in 2017, which means that employees, depending on contractual clauses, can exercise the right to retire at 60 or continue working.
- Migrant workers accounted for more than 10% of the total labour force prior to the pandemic, according to the UN. These workers typically come from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and fill low-skilled vacancies in industries such as agriculture, construction and domestic work. Since the pandemic, the country has suffered from a shortage of unskilled/low-skilled migrant workers. The cabinet approved extending these workers' stay in Thailand to up to February 2025 to ease the labour shortage. The labour pool will also be driven by the development of special economic zones (SEZs), which the government has opened in border areas to capitalise on the supply of low-cost migrant labour from neighbouring countries. As a result, tensions will inevitably rise between local and migrant workers on issues of mistreatment and locals' resentment of job losses to migrant labourers.

Infrastructure will remain a key pillar of the government's plan for recovery The country's score for infrastructure improves in the forecast period. While its global ranking rises from 52nd to 51st in 2022-26, Thailand's regional ranking drops marginally from 9th to 10th because of faster improvements in other Asian economies. The military-aligned government will expedite medium-sized work projects while continuing to push for faster progress on long-pending "megaprojects". 4G coverage is widely available, and its speed has improved. Within South-east Asia, the average internet speed lags behind only Singapore and Vietnam. Improvements in utilities, including work on electricity, water supply and distribution and gas pipes, will continue. Electricity supply has grown, but the potential for shortages remains. More than 70% of Thailand's electricity is generated using natural gas, according to the Energy Policy and Plan-ning Office, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices, which has become a more prominent issue amid the war in Ukraine.

- The government has faced delays in the financing and implementation stages of its ambitious infrastructure development megaprojects, in particular on the regional rail network, owing to issues with land acquisition, environmental impact and commercial viability. This includes the construction of the much-vaunted Thai section of the high-speed railway linking Thailand and China, via Laos (which has started after long delays, but is still in early stages). The Thai government had pledged to complete the Bangkok-Nong Khai section, of which only 5% has been built, by 2028. Elsewhere, regional transport projects have faced similar delays owing to wrangling over financing with Chinese and Japanese investors. This partly reflects the government's efforts to take advantage of the ongoing competition for geopolitical influence between the two countries to secure the best deal. We expect these dynamics to result in uneven progress on priority projects in 2022-26.
- The planned upgrade of the country's three major airports by Airports of Thailand (a state-run management company) is still ongoing. The expansion in the capital, Bangkok, will be completed by 2024. Expansion plans on the existing Chiang Mai and Phuket airports will be carried out during the forecast period to prepare for the post-pandemic revival of tourism, but the construction of new airports at Chiang Mai and Phuket will probably only materialise beyond the end of the forecast period. Expansion work on U-Tapao airport, in the EEC, will also start in 2023; operations will begin by 2026.

5G networks will continue to improve, as part of the Thailand 4.0 initiative
- The government will continue to prioritise the development of infrastructure in the EEC. The cabinet endorsed the EEC Regional Infrastructure Construction Action Plan for 2023-27 to galvanise transport networks. The plan encompasses 77 projects worth Bt337bn, including high-speed railways, Chachoengsao dryport and U-Tapao airport. During the forecast period there will be accelerated construction of government-supported megaprojects under EEC, which will in turn attract more foreign investment The pandemic has spurred the development of 5G networks in Thailand, and the country now leads its ASEAN counterparts in the 5G race. Three operators have already launched 5G networks, providing such services to retail customers. In June 2022 the government unveiled the Thailand 5G Alliance, a public-private grouping with the purpose of promoting next-generation applications in various sectors to transform the country into a regional digital hub, to support the Thailand 4.0 initiative.

Thailand's technological readiness score improves significantly in 2022-26, which boosts its global ranking to 42th and regional ranking to 10th in the forecast period. The change reflects our expectation that the government will increase its investment in research and development (R&D) and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and continue to improve digital infrastructure in 2022-26. To fulfil its Thailand 4.0 goals, the government will scale up incentives for international companies to set up research bases inside the country. According to DataReportal, while Thailand's number of internet users per 100 population increased to 77.8 in January 2022, it remains lower than in Brunei (95), Singapore (92), Malaysia (89.6) and Cambodia (78.8). However, high smartphone usage still makes the country a ripe market for e-commerce and digital banking. As at April 2022 there were 88m mobile banking accounts in the country, which has a population of 70m.
Benefits of digitisation will not extend beyond big cities
- The government has outlined plans to pursue digital infrastructure projects initiated by the junta as part of the Thailand 4.0 strategy and the 20-year digital roadmap. The Village Broadband Project (Net Pracharat), launched in 2017, aims to bring national broadband to 25,000 remote communities, with the aim of developing rural areas and giving private-sector enterprises access to public infrastructure. Progress on this front has been slow because of cost issues and the poor quality of wireless hotspots, but the pandemic has increased the sense of urgency to accelerate broadband access for rural villages so that residents are not left behind. As Net Pracharat provides the internet in public spaces (not individual households), usage has declined since the start of the pandemic, amid fears over viral transmission in public spaces. The government has blacklisted a state telecoms company, TOT, over its failure to deliver broadband to these villages on time. As a result, any socioeconomic transformation to be brought about by 5G internet in the forecast period will still be limited to the big cities and their surrounding areas.
- The BOI will probably step up incentives, such as import duty exemptions on raw materials used in R&D, to expedite the development of innovative capacities in the private sector, which has long shown a lack of commercial acumen in the deployment of technology. Companies focused on biotechnology, nanotechnology, advanced materials or digital technology are also eligible for up to 13 years' exemption from corporate income tax if they co-operate with public research institutions in R&D. Spurred by the pandemic, digitalisation efforts will increase in the private sector, and there will be greater adoption of artificial intelligence, big data and quantum computing, especially among large companies with resources.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government has shifted its policy to "living with covid", treating the disease as endemic, and has allowed the resumption of normal economic activity. This has included lifting border controls and welcoming back international tourists. A vast majority of the adult population has been fully vaccinated, which reduces the risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed by any potential future coronavirus outbreaks.
The war in Ukraine will discourage the Thai government from fiscal austerity, as it looks to avoid derailing the economic recovery in 2022. Domestic demand had barely recovered from the pandemic when prices of basics such as energy and food began to rise sharply. This means that some relief measures introduced during the pandemic will remain in place, and that price controls will be imposed on some essential goods as the government aims to cushion rising living costs. Growth is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, making Thailand a laggard among its regional peers.
In time, the government will return to its long-term focus on boosting economic competitiveness. The ambitious Thailand 4.0 industrial policy will remain the blueprint for the country's transformation into a sophisticated manufacturing and technology hub. This will entail the provision of generous tax breaks and more accessible working visas for foreign investors and professionals. However, Thailand's aspiration to become a high-technology economy will face obstacles-most notably the lack of skilled labour and fierce competition from better-positioned regional peers. Conflict with vested interests and political competition will continue to affect major public infrastructure projects, which will fall behind schedule and exert a drag on competitiveness.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Government expenditure 20.1 20.9 21.3 20.8 20.8 20.5
Government revenue 14.6 15.9 17.1 17.2 17.5 17.6
Budget balance -5.5 -5.0 -4.2 -3.7 -3.3 -2.9
We forecast the budget deficit to remain wide by historical standards in 2022, at the equivalent of 5% of GDP, owing to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and surging inflation on tax revenue and government spending. Thailand has unveiled multiple rounds of stimulus totalling more than US$13bn since early 2021, the disbursement of which will add to the deficit in the coming years. Measures aimed at slowing the rise in consumer prices generated by the war in Ukraine, including fuel subsidies, will also contribute to the deficit in 2022.
The government will finance the deficit through the issuance of new debt, enabled by the authorisation of additional borrowing worth US$16bn in June 2021 and the raising of the debt ceiling from 60% of GDP to 70%. We forecast that this will drive total public debt to the equivalent of around 62.6% of the country's nominal GDP by 2023, from a pre-pandemic level of 41.2% in 2019.
Expensive relief measures have already been phased out gradually and further withdrawal of stimulus measures will continue this year, amid growing concern over the surging debt stock. This will markedly narrow the budget deficit in 2024 to a pre-pandemic level. Increased infrastructure spending and investment will form the bulk of the rise in government expenditure after the impact of the pandemic dissipates, funded in part by steady economic growth. An increase in value-added tax in the latter part of the forecast period, from the current rate of 7%, will also bolster revenue.

Money market interest rate (year‑end) 0.5 0.6 1.5 1.7 1.3 1.2
The war in Ukraine will continue to exert upward pressure on domestic prices and depreciatory pressure on the local currency, the baht, against the US dollar. As economic recovery should firm in the second half of 2022 (albeit remaining modest compared to Thailand's peers), we now expect the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) to raise its policy interest rates three times this year; the first of these was sanctioned at the monetary policy meeting in August. By the end of the year the interest rate should reach 1.25%, from a record low of 0.5%. Barring a recession among Thailand's major trading partners, gradual monetary tightening should continue until policy rates return to about 2% by the end of 2023. In the later part of the forecast period, we expect the authorities to switch to monetary easing again, as the priority will shift back to supporting growth, given Thailand's tepid expansion in comparison with its peers.
Despite aggressive tightening in the US, the relatively fragile recovery will prevent the BOT from mirroring that rapid pace in raising the policy rate. Concern about the high level of household debt, currently at about 90% of GDP, will also complicate any rapid moves to raise rates.
The latent impact of the economic fallout from the pandemic will lead to a rise in non-performing loans in the banking sector in 2022-23. However, the ongoing support measures for distressed debtors, spearheaded by the BOT, will help to keep the rise in bad loans manageable for banks.

Economic forecast: Economic growth Economic growth will accelerate from 1.6% in 2021 to 2.8% in 2022, representing only a modest improvement considering the depth of the pandemic-induced contraction (-6.3%) in 2020. The prospects for rapid recovery remain remote as a gradual and incomplete recovery in tourism delays a return to the pre-pandemic economic trajectory. The war in Ukraine further jeopardises the growth outlook, owing to the effect of higher inflation on consumption spending and the potential disruption of global supply chains.
Household expenditure will rise by 1.9% in 2022. The lifting of pandemic-related restrictions this year will lead to higher nominal wage growth, but a rise in headline inflation will keep real wage growth negative, reining in consumer spending. However, exports of goods and services will still grow by 8%, amid an ongoing relaxation of covid-19 restrictions in key overseas markets. The return of mass tourism, expected to begin in 2023, will lift GDP growth before a deceleration to a slower but steady rate in the latter part of the forecast period.
Thailand has lifted almost all restrictions and reopened the tourism sector from July 1st; the authorities are unlikely to re-impose stringent restrictions even if the caseload surges again. This will support a stronger recovery in tourist arrivals in the second half of 2022. However, our expectation that China-the biggest source market for Thailand-will maintain its "zero-covid" policy in 2022-23 means that overall tourism arrivals and revenue are unlikely to return to their pre-pandemic levels until early 2024.
With the US-China trade conflict set to persist following the pandemic, Thai exporters are likely to reap some benefits as multinationals diversify their regional supply chains. However, Western-led sanctions on Russia will lead to more supply-chain problems and higher costs for Thai manufacturers, exporters and the agricultural sector. The government's introduction of incentives for the production of electronic vehicles will boost the competitiveness of the automotive sector against rising competition in the region.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow at an annual average of 3.1% in 2022-26. The seemingly impressive headline figures mask the fact that industrial output will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023, owing to the deep contraction that it suffered in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to Thailand's export-oriented manufacturing sector, in particular the automotive industry. The sector will benefit from the normalisation of global economic circumstances from the pandemic, which will allow industrial production to resume steady growth amid increased public investment in infrastructure. Thailand will probably not gain significantly from the relocation of supply chains away from China amid ongoing US-China trade tensions and the implementation of RCEP. This reflects concerns about the country's increasingly expensive labour and a relatively small pool of skilled workers compared with rapidly growing regional economies.
The effects of the pandemic will continue to limit recovery in 2022-23 The services sector will grow by an annual average of 3.5% in 2022-26. Tourism, which traditionally accounts for over 70% of the sector, will continue to recover in 2022-23 as pandemic-induced restrictions are lifted, but it will only return to pre-pandemic levels in early 2024. This stems from the fact that China, which had been the largest source of Thailand's inbound tourism, is set to maintain its "zero-covid" policy throughout 2022 and 2023. However, in the longer term, Thailand will retain its attraction as a major global tourist destination.
Meanwhile, the financial sector will remain relatively healthy. Although the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans is likely to remain elevated as the fallout of the pandemic lingers, the sector will be able to weather the storm with its adequate capitalisation and a competent central bank. However, household debt remains elevated, which will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2021-25. In the first quarter of 2022 household debt remained at around 90% of GDP, compared to 84.9% at end-2020. Elsewhere, the telecommunications segment will record stable growth towards the end of the forecast period, as Thailand's roll-out of 5G networks gets under way. This will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services and will dovetail with the continued expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The agriculture sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by implementation issues and a lack of government attention, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to raise productivity by employing more sophisticated technologies. Some industries, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to Western countries' market-access requirements regarding labour rights. These weaknesses will ensure that farmers remain an important interest group for the new government. We expect the agriculture sector to grow by an annual average of 2.6% in 2022-26.

We expect a surge in global logistics and energy costs, as well as food and raw material prices, to exert sustained pressure on consumer prices in 2022. This will push average consumer price inflation from 1.2% in 2021 to 6% in 2022. This will be the result of supply-side pressure rather than a broad-based recovery in domestic demand, which will remain weak as household income stagnates. Global energy prices will be a factor, even though they will have come down in the second half of 2022 from the peak recorded in the second quarter, amid the protracted war in Ukraine. We expect the government to unveil further price control measures and fuel subsidies, but they will be only partially effective in slowing the rise in prices and will contribute to a large budget deficit.
Furthermore, the widening interest-rate differential brought about by aggressive policy tightening in the US will keep the local currency weak vis-à-vis the US dollar; this will generate additional inflationary pressure.

The delay in the recovery of the tourism sector has weakened the macroeconomic fundamentals underpinning the baht. We expect the currency to remain weak throughout 2022, as the policy interest-rate differential between the US and Thailand widens. This informs our forecast that the currency will maintain its depreciatory trajectory, reaching Bt35.5US$1 by the end of 2022 (from Bt33.4:US$1 a year earlier).

We forecast that the current account will again register a deficit in 2022, equivalent to 0.3% of GDP, following one equivalent to 2.2% of GDP in 2021. The service account will register a smaller deficit owing to a modest and incomplete recovery in the tourism sector. Thailand's exports of merchandise goods will continue to expand at a decent pace, with demand holding up in many of the country's major trading partners (such as the US). Thailand's traditionally strong export sectors-electronics, the automotive sector and agriculture in particular-will also contribute to the trade surplus, although a potential shortage of integrated circuits could limit the increase in car exports.
Thailand will continue to champion free trade and deeper regional integration. With RCEP already in force, the country has joined the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and will probably focus on completing negotiations with the EU and commencing talks on joining another mega-regional trade deal, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, in the latter part of our forecast period.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand Stocks and flows Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows had increased steadily in 2015-19, owing to a more stable political environment and the previous junta's efforts to attract infrastructure investment, which included a range of incentives and the liberalisation of strategic industries. The uncertainty triggered by the war in Ukraine, on top of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, which had halted such growth in 2020, will continue to weigh on foreign investors' sentiment concerning emerging economies in the early parts of the forecast period (2022-26). In comparison with the virus-stricken 2020-21, however, post-pandemic expectations of policy continuity under a military-aligned government and a recovery in external demand should result in a substantial increase in inflows from 2023 (assuming that the pandemic eases by then). Outward investment, particularly to countries within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), is also expected to increase later in the forecast period after the pandemic eases. In 2021 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$284bn, equivalent to 56.1% of GDP, while the stock of outward FDI stood at US$180bn.
Origin and distribution The private manufacturing sector has traditionally attracted the largest proportion of FDI into Thailand. Before the pandemic disrupted the investment environment, manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances in particular attracted significant foreign interest. However, the financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence in recent years, particularly as industrial production faces bottlenecks and weak external conditions prevailed even before the pandemic. Japanese firms retain their position as the main investors in Thailand, but investment from China has greatly increased. Chinese investors, at least as much as their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure development plans, but this will come in the form of vendor contracts in construction, logistics planning and technology.
Determinants Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its decent infrastructure, flexible labour laws and relatively friendly regulatory regime for foreign investors. Nonetheless, any sign of political instability, which remains a persistent risk, as well as growing regional competition, will pose a challenge to Thailand's attractiveness in the medium term. The Board of Investment (BOI) offers incentives, which generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including granting permission to bring in foreign workers, to own land and to take or remit foreign currency abroad. The new large-scale Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. Thailand has generally been regarded as one of the most open economies in the region to foreign investment. The BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy, launched in 2015, has continued to extend incentives to newer industries such as alternative energy and environmental services, and hospitality and wellness, while removing existing incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries. The BOI has also been encouraging investment into infrastructure, through a number of big-ticket projects. In addition, it has expedited the investment application and approval process in recent years, and is likely to retain this as a priority as regional competition for foreign investment intensifies in the wake of the pandemic. Disagreements from lawmakers (and sometimes within the governing coalition) will slow the pace of decision-making on investment related to expensive infrastructure megaprojects.
Impact Steady FDI inflows, which are still recovering from the ongoing pandemic, have long helped to support overall economic growth and contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pick-up trucks), electronics (especially computer parts) and electrical appliances. Reliance on FDI for financing major economic initiatives has nonetheless compounded the economy's already significant exposure to external conditions.
Potential Thailand's political scene has remained relatively stable, despite recurring student-led protests since the public approval of the junta-drafted constitution in a referendum in 2016 and the smooth accession of the new king. After a brief period of uncertainty around the election held in March 2019, political stability will be broadly maintained in 2022-26, despite a temporary increase in volatility surrounding the upcoming election by early 2023. Serious challenges to the dominant royalist-military political alliance are unlikely to materialise during the forecast period, which bodes well for steady FDI flows. The continued implementation of the RCEP should also add to the kingdom's attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment, even if Thailand is unlikely to be the chief beneficiary from the 15-member trade agreement in the region. However, the volatile nature of Thailand's politics will remain a risk. A number of structural challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years, aside from the ongoing pandemic. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has been diminishing because of a rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and sluggish domestic demand compared with other markets in South-east Asia. Although the current administration will maintain the junta's commitment to liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to strategic sectors such as telecommunications, media and utilities remains difficult. The standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, but it remains inferior to Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location, while poorer competitors such as Vietnam and Indonesia begin to catch up. The government's focus on expediting an infrastructure development programme, which dates to the junta era, will rectify this shortfall to a degree. Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of being a leading economy with an open regulatory regime in the region, but there is a rising risk that it may lose out to its regional peers as they improve their business environments at a faster rate.

Family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate low, at 0.1% per year, in the forecast period. By 2026 the population is forecast to reach 72m, with females accounting for slightly more than half of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 6.3 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 6.8 per 1,000 in 2017-21. Life expectancy will also continue to edge upwards despite the temporary impact of the covid-19 pandemic, with men expected to live for an average of 74 years in 2022-26, up from 72.8 in 2017-21, whereas female life expectancy will rise from an average of 80.2 years to 81.2 over the same period.
Demographic ageing and a smaller workforce will add strains on the budget Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion aged under 15 inching lower since 2011. Meanwhile, the proportion aged over 65 is set to grow to 16.5% in 2026, up from 13.2% in 2021. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio will remain relative low at 0.23 in 2026, from 0.24 in 2016, and the old-age dependency ratio will rise from 0.19 to 0.24 over the same period. This demographic trend will place further strain on healthcare and pension provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme that was introduced in 2001 and has been free for all citizens since 2006. EIU expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period. It will, nonetheless, face growing burdens as a result of the country's ageing population, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and the country's poor air quality.
Fatality and health issues from worsening air pollution will increase. The crude death rate is forecast at 8.2 per 1,000 in 2022-26. Non-com-municable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases (but not including covid-19) are traditionally responsible for around 75% of all deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO also reported in 2015 that Thailand has the world's second-highest road traffic fatality rate, at 36.2 per 100,000 population. Deteriorating air quality-pollution levels in Bangkok (the capital) and northern provinces have hit record highs in recent years-also poses a threat of increased premature death and health burdens. Meanwhile, Thailand continues to make progress in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which was a leading cause of death in the country during the early 2000s. The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that the death rate from the disease declined to about 13 per 100,000 people in 2021, and that the number of people living with the disease remained stable at around 500,000 people in that year. Other infectious diseases, such as cholera, measles and mumps, have become less common but have not been eradicated.
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, and shortages of skilled labour are likely to become more pronounced in the next five years. The labour force will contract slowly, dropping to 38.3m by 2026, owing to a decline in the working-age population. Migrant labour will return from the coronavirus-related restrictions in the latter half of our forecast period and remain abundant after the pandemic, with workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos dominating unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees. However, Thailand will gradually become a less attractive destination for unskilled migrants over the long term. In the near term, this will partly reflect a less welcoming stance on the part of the authorities and the general public, who are keen to prioritise the development of strategic industries in border-located special economic zones. In the longer term, job opportunities in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will expand as those economies grow more quickly than Thailand.
Urbanisation will remain a significant demographic trend. Despite slow population growth, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period, with a subsequent reduction in average household size. Internal migration and changing social patterns mean that it is increasingly common for households to consist of nuclear rather than extended families. Although Bangkok remains the main focus for the urban population, other cities, including Surat Thani, Chiang Mai and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. The share of rural population has declined slowly over the years, but remained at almost 50% in 2020, according to the World Bank, which is still quite high by the standards of middle-income countries. This means that further expansion of metropolitan cities amid increasing urbanisation will continue to feature as a prominent demographic theme in the forecast period following the disruption of covid-19.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market, with a population of 71.6m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$505.8bn at market exchange rates in 2021. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that goods exported from Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's market of 500m, including a middle class with growing disposable income. The implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership from 2022-26 will further expand the regional reach of its goods and services.
EIU forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will grow steadily throughout the forecast period, after the pandemic and loss of tourism receipts interrupted the upward trajectory in 2020-22. A markedly weaker local currency vis-à-vis the US dollar in 2022-23 will also weigh on profitability for retailers, especially foreign ones. A more alarming challenge in the longer term will be the wide wealth gap, which will worsen, as lower socioeconomic groups have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. According to the latest data from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), of the 6.2% of the population defined as living below the nationally defined poverty line in 2019, the majority reside in the rural north and north-eastern parts of the country. This number has grown further following the pandemic, and it will take years to fall again. The capital, Bangkok, remains the wealthiest region by far. Structural issues, such as the fact that opportunities in rural areas remain limited compared with urban centres, will remain largely unaddressed.
High household debt will constrain growth in consumption in 2022-26 Household spending will be tempered by high personal debt, which has also been aggravated by the pandemic. In particular, debt burdens among those on lower incomes have a significant negative effect on overall consumer demand and limit the prospects for social mobility. This will particularly affect the share available for spending on consumer goods, ensuring that Thailand's retail goods market experiences relatively low growth compared with its neighbours, as the effect of the release of pent-up demand will prove short-lived.

On average, retail sales volumes will grow by 5.2% per year in 2022-26, which is markedly faster than in 2017-21. In the first two years of the forecast period, consumer sentiment will remain dampened by the pandemic and rapidly rising inflation prompted by the war in Ukraine. During this time, the government will maintain price controls and subsidies aimed at helping low-income and unemployed citizens. Given the uncertain state of private consumption amid the pandemic and geopolitical uncertainty, the value-added tax (VAT) rate is likely to be frozen at the current level of 7% until 2024. The government will finance such emergency measures by running a larger budget deficit and increasing borrowing. However, the priority of tackling a wide fiscal deficit means that VAT will be raised later in the forecast period. Meanwhile, higher "sin taxes" on sugar, alcohol and tobacco will have a minor impact on the consumption pattern of the population at large.
Discretionary spending will be notably higher at the end of the forecast period Consumer expenditure on essential items, such as food, household goods and clothing, will fall gradually as a proportion of total expenditure throughout the forecast period. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants is likely to resume growth from 2022 as travel restrictions are lifted. This will be further supported by government efforts to promote domestic tourism and to attract high-spending foreign tourists to luxury resorts. A similar situation applies to other categories of discretionary expenditure such as leisure, although it still will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. Growth in healthcare spending is forecast to increase steadily in absolute terms in 2022-26, as the population ages. The fluctuation in spending on transport and communications will partially reflect movement in global energy prices, and access to the internet will become more affordable during the forecast period.

Initial conditions: The past two decades have been characterised by political turmoil, with coups in 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, owing to natural disasters and political crises. Physical infrastructure remains inadequate in many respects. Reform of the education system has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the quality of teaching or the curriculum. The workforce is therefore characterised by a low level of technical skills-a problem made worse by rapid demographic ageing. On top of these long-standing structural issues, the current government will also have to deal with a battered economy amid an extended coronavirus pandemic.
Demographic trends: Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the ageing population. Although the female labour force participation rate will have risen by 2030, this will not prevent an average annual contraction of around 1% in the labour force in 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation concerning immigrants' right to work, especially in skilled positions, will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immi-gration and long-term visa policies further, owing to the country's negative demographic profile. The effectiveness of this could be limited by domestic political concerns over immigration, in connection with rising ethnic tensions and anti-immigration sentiment.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. Although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China, Thailand will struggle to capitalise on this opportunity owing to a lack of competitiveness compared with lower-cost locations, such as Indonesia and Vietnam. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Cambodia. Closer integration with China could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China and South-east Asia, meeting China's increasing demand for foreign holidays, region-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. The government is already spearheading a move in that direction under its "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy and, in part, via its new Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone. This is particularly the case for the tourism sector, and the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way to supporting these aims, although the pandemic will weigh on the sector in the foreseeable future. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so. The development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations Economic Community, formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand to the degree that the country retains its prominence in the region. In 2021-30 a relocation of regional supply chains will pick up pace amid increased trade and geopolitical tensions. Simmering US-China tensions will also prompt some investors to diversify outside China. Although Thailand will benefit from these shifts, gains will be overshadowed by those of its regional compe-titors such as Taiwan and Vietnam, owing to the kingdom's weaknesses in the labour market in terms of wages and skill levels.
Institutions and policy trends: In the coming decades, there will be no resolution of the power struggle between the established military and older bureaucratic elites in the capital, Bangkok, who will continue to side with the royal establishment to bolster their legitimacy, and the rural and younger masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate. The level of political tension will depend on successive governments' ability to restructure the economy further away from agriculture and tourism, not least by moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into high-value industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reform, as well as a focus on medium-to-long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy depends heavily on whether future governments are capable of initiating and implementing the necessary structural reform, while also upgrading infrastructure. Liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population on the budget could be offset by greater use of advanced healthcare technology and 5G-enabled technologies. On the issue of boosting productivity to rival Thailand's competitors, the government could improve educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce and engage further with large domestic private firms to promote a more innovative economy. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas. A more probable and effective measure would be greater access to the labour market for immigrants, although rising ethnic tensions could undermine its implementation.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Thailand published a long-term climate change adaptation plan in 2015, entitled the Climate Change Master Plan 2015-50. It outlines a three-pronged approach, divided into mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building targets. The near-term goals included setting emission-reduction targets and establishing incentives for low-carbon-emission development. Medium-term targets included reaching at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable sources. Longer-term targets are vaguer, with general goals to increase private investment in green industries and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy. In line with this plan, Thailand signed and ratified the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2016, committing to specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under COP21, Thailand has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and "net-zero" greenhouse gas emissions by 2065, but it has yet to offer any policy details as to how it plans to achieve these goals. The latest government figures in 2020-21 show some results in the country's push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, although the situation was skewed heavily by the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. More crucial to meeting the climate target by 2050 will be more far-reaching and costly measures, such as carbon pricing and plans to phase-out fossil fuels, which have yet to be introduced as part of the policy agenda, despite promises from the government.
The main determinant of emissions levels in Thailand in the coming decades will still be energy sourcing. Coal-fired power plants generate close to one-fifth of the country's electricity, while lesser-polluting liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation. Most of these plants are situated in the south of the country. The government will continue to push for the expansion of natural gas and renewable energy sources as a share of the country's energy mix, and renewable energy is likely to account for around one-quarter of total generation capacity by 2040. The commissioning of nuclear power plants in Thailand, which would reduce reliance on high-polluting forms, is also a possibility. However, relatively low coal prices will mean that it continues to account for a sizeable share of energy generation over the next two decades, unless there is robust international pressure-and, crucially, concrete monetary incentives-for a change of course.
The country, especially its most economically productive areas, including Bangkok, will be vulnerable to the intensified impact of climate change in the coming decades. This will be felt most acutely through the rising sea level, flooding, droughts and air pollution, which will in turn feed into economic insecurity, infrastructure strains, health burdens and social unrest. In 2019 EIU developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth. Our latest calculations find that the Thai economy will be 3.1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments In May 2016 the junta unveiled "Thailand 4.0", a sector-specific industrial policy that aims to attract new investment in the transformation of the economy. The name of the strategy describes the intended next stage in the sectoral development of the economy, characterised by the industrial application of state-of-the-art technology. It follows the current domestic industrial situation, which is dominated by heavy industry with advanced machinery, in segments such as automotive and chemicals production. Although the pandemic in 2020-21 forced the government to sideline the initiative, the longer-term strategy of creating value via new technologies in strategic sectors will return to prominence in 2022-26, especially after the upcoming election. Industries including smart electronics, high-income and medical tourism, agriculture and biotechnology, food and beverages and the electrical automotive industry will be the focus. The strategy is also supposed to extend to the development of new industries, such as robotics, aerospace, digital services, bioenergy and biochemicals, and healthcare. Government incentives for investment in these sectors will remain in place, targeted explicitly towards the introduction of new technology, for example by offering import-duty exemption on capital goods for listed industries. Thailand will make some progress in upgrading its industries, but is likely to be constrained by a limited supply of skilled labour.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows the EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by the EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2017-21) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2022-26). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by the EIU for 2017-21. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2022-26 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2017-21 ranges are then used to derive 2022-26 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2022-26, not to the likely situation in 2026 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2019 or 2024). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - EIU believes that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, will retain control of the legislature until the next parliamentary elections. However, the BJP-led coalition is unlikely to gain a simple majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament) in the forecast period (2022-26), which will impair its ability to pass legislation unilaterally. Increasing government controls of democratic institutions is likely, but the risk of political instability remains very low. We expect the BJP to secure a significant share of the vote at the next parliamentary election, which is due in 2024. The government's Hindu-nationalist agenda will cause social tensions to rise in the longer term. The strained relationship with China, a closer strategic relation with the US, and reduced defence reliance on Russia will continue in 2022-26 and beyond.

- The business environment will improve in 2022-26, taking its global ranking from 64th in the historical period to 54th out of the 82 countries assessed. Among those of its BRICS peers (comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), India's overall score is well above that of Russia (4.33) but fares slightly worse than Brazil (6.30), China (6.31) and South Africa (6.39). Improvements are expected in the scores for infrastructure, taxes, foreign trade rules and foreign investment. However, the overall score masks uneven progress across regions, with the west and south continuing to fare much better.

- Economic growth in fiscal years 2022/23-2026/27 (April-March) will average 5.4% per year, which is slower than the rates recorded before the onset of the pandemic. Growth will be led by private consumption, government investment and exports, while private investment will be slow to pick up. Fiscal policy will focus on capital spending even as consolidation efforts continue. Tax collection will improve as will progress on the divestment of government stakes. The Indian rupee will face continuous depreciation pressure over the next five years, owing to the country's current-account deficit and relatively high rates of inflation. Monetary policy will tighten further in 2023, before slowing growth leads to rate cuts over 2025 and 2026.

- India's economy will benefit from a growing labour force, which will expand by 2.7% per year on average in 2022-26. However, reaping the full benefit of the country's young workforce will prove difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities. Large skill gaps will persist owing to inadequacies in the primary education system. Underemployment and unemployment will be compounded by a wide gender imbalance, which has worsened since the pandemic. Continued rural to urban migration will also add to existing pressures on urban infrastructure. Agriculture will continue to be a major employer of the rural population, while the construction and services sectors will provide more opportunities than manufacturing for the urban workforce.

- Sustained real GDP growth in 2022/23-2026/27 will support wage growth and assist the expansion of the middle class, even as GDP per head will remain low, at US$2,819 in 2026. Consumption propensity will remain high in urban areas, where income streams have not been vastly affected by the pandemic, while rural consumption will improve from 2023. We also expect that more households will be able to afford premium products in 2022-26. The e-commerce sector will expand strongly with higher smartphone and internet penetration, boosting retail spending

- India's economic growth will slow but remain stronger than in many developing countries, supported by a shift in employment from rural to urban areas. However, it is likely to remain below potential amid structural challenges. Income inequality will become more pronounced, as successive governments fail to create productive employment opportunities. India's growing economy will make it an increasingly influential diplomatic force. Owing to shared strategic geopolitical interests, India will move closer to the US and Japan. The continuing rivalry for influence in South Asia will keep ties with China strained.

a Actual. b EIU estimates.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.4bn people in 2021, according to the UN. India was the third largest in the world that year, measured in nominal US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates by the World Bank.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom
Policy issues: The ruling BJP has made significant progress in passing structural reform since it came to power in 2014. In September 2020, it passed legislation to liberalise labour laws. EIU expects the government to undertake land acquisition reforms only after the general election in 2024 because of substantial resistance by interest groups. Other reforms, such as reducing the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic sectors and leaving non-strategic sectors by privatising SOEs have seen moderate success, and will remain policy priorities. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority during its second term of office, as well as after 2024, when we expect the BJP to secure another term of office.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2022-26, including by further digitising tax departments, and linking bank accounts with permanent account numbers for taxation. This, coupled with a pick-up in economic growth from 2022/23 onwards, will support healthy tax collection. Despite some reforms, including a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain complex, although not unpredictable.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit widened to US$176.7bn in 2021, from US$95.5bn in 2020, and the surplus on the country's services account rose from US$87.1bn to US$102.7bn in the same period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is technically secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched and elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades. The country's two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which has served in more governments than the BJP since independence, often in coalition with smaller regional parties.

The BJP, which has been in power since 2014, holds an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) while a number of smaller parties are also in the NDA coalition. Over the past few years, regional parties have gained increasing prominence in many state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics through the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). The NDA currently falls short of a majority in the upper house, and it is unlikely to secure enough seats to dominate that chamber in the EIU's forecast period (2022-26). However, co-operation with non-aligned parties will allow most bills to pass without additional difficulties.

The BJP's ideological approach leans towards Hindu nationalism, mixing social conservatism with a more aggressive foreign and security policy. Its increasing dominance of national and state governments has thus challenged India's secularism. The party has increased its tilt towards rural-focused policies in a move to extend its vote base beyond urban areas. The opposition Congress has a more centre-left ideological approach to socio-economic issues.

Political outlook: Political stability We expect the ruling BJP to complete its full term in office, which is due to expire in 2024, bolstered by its majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament). India's prime minister since 2014, Narendra Modi, will remain the dominant political figure. The deep-seated influence of Mr Modi (and the BJP) and the lack of an effective national political opposition limit the risks to political stability.
The decline in the vote share of the Indian National Congress in state and national elections over the past five years has diminished its effectiveness as the principal national opposition party, and this trend will not be reversed in 2022-26. An emerging trend of regional parties becoming strong competitors to the BJP at state-level elections will continue over our forecast period.
Over 2022 the government will increase its strength in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), with the help of coalition allies, as a result of victories in important state legislative assembly elections (state legislatures form the electoral college for the upper chamber). After farmer-led protests in 2021 led to the reversal of agricultural liberalisation reforms that were announced in 2020, the government will refrain from enacting controversial reforms such as land acquisition plans until after the next national election in 2024. However, a victory in the election would subsequently put these reforms on the government's agenda again. Opposition to structural reforms will not threaten political stability during our forecast period.
The BJP will intensify its Hindu nationalist agenda in the run-up to the next general election. As a result, intermittent religious and communal clashes will persist. Over the longer term, increased interference in India's democratic institutions poses a risk to political stability. Under Mr Modi, the authorities will maintain strong control over social and broader media.
The government will decide on elections for the centrally administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir after the electoral roll is finalised (due by August). Extremist organisations in Kashmir will keep the threat of terrorist attacks in major cities elevated.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness in 2022-26 is mixed. The BJP dominates the political landscape at the national level and in most state assemblies. The party has full control of the lower house, and its large majority gained in 2019 helps to bolster policy effectiveness. Although the ruling NDA is unlikely to attain a simple majority in the upper house in the forecast period, it will be able to facilitate the passage of bills with the support of some independent parties.
Support for the BJP and Mr Modi will remain strong, especially at the rural level, which will enable the party to secure re-election in 2024 with a significant majority. In addition, the administration will actively pursue its agenda of Hindu nationalism. The election of Droupadi Murmu as India's president in July 2022 will help the BJP to secure votes among the tribal population, as Ms Murmu, who was the BJP's candidate, hails from a tribal background. This will help to improve the BJP's electoral prospects in some state elections scheduled for 2023-25, where tribal populations influence votes. However, the party's resolve to promote unpopular structural reforms, such as relaxing labour laws, will reduce its vote share in state elections.
The BJP has been an advocate of competitive federalism, which encourages competition between India's states. We believe that this approach will lead to an improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west of the country. However, it is also likely to deepen economic disparities between India's more economically successful states and its laggards, increasing social friction, competition for fiscal resources and pressure for migration between regions.
The BJP's dominance of national politics has weakened checks and balances within India's polity, and this will continue over 2022-26. Although content critical of the government is published and broadcast, the government subtly pressured media groups and social media service providers to censor content during a severe covid-19 wave in 2021. Although the judiciary is independent, members of the judiciary seem polarised, as some have criticised the government's overreach. There remains a risk that the government could engage in a major confrontation with the judiciary at some point in the next five years over a major policy decision related to religious matters. Judicial challenges to the government's policies towards minority religions could also be a point of friction.
Political outlook: Election watch The next general election will be held in May 2024, when the BJP will enjoy the advantages of incumbency, a weak opposition and a strong electoral machine. We expect Mr Modi to remain the BJP's candidate for prime minister, although his age may prevent him from serving out the entire five-year term, and he may hand over the leadership to a party comrade. His likely opponent will be the de facto leader of Congress, Rahul Gandhi, who led the party against the BJP during the latter's landslide electoral victory in 2019 and is widely unpopular among the electorate. Although regional parties have a stronghold in several states, it is unlikely that they will be able to band together successfully to challenge the BJP at national level.
During the presidential election in July 2022, Ms Murmu was elected by the members of state and central legislatures. Although her role is largely symbolic, her appointment reveals the strong support of the ruling BJP.
Political outlook: International relations India has maintained a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, refraining from condemnation of Russia. This position has been dictated by India's historically strong diplomatic relations with Russia and its traditional reliance on Russian defence equipment. Although this caused some consternation with India's partners in the Quad (an informal diplomatic grouping with the US, Australia and Japan), cordial relations have largely been maintained. Given the geographical and strategic importance of India's role in the Quad, differences over Russia will not deter closer co-operation, although we believe that the expansion of security ties within the grouping will be slow. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework announced by the Quad leaders in May lacks a concrete agenda so far. Nevertheless, we believe that India will reduce its reliance on Russia by diversifying its sources of defence imports. The main beneficiaries of this diversification will be the US and France, from where defence acquisitions had already been stepped up before the Ukraine war.
Bilateral relations between India and China will remain tense. India's prerogative to resolve border disputes before engaging on wider issues has not been met with enthusiastic response from China, even as the latter attempted to resume engagement with India in April 2022. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project will also undermine relations. Both sides have increased the deployment of heavy weaponry near the border, raising the risk of military clashes in 2022-26, although a full-blown conflict is outside our core forecast.
Under the current administration in Pakistan led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, the two countries will attempt to resume engagement. However, any major improvement in the currently strained relationship between India and Pakistan is unlikely during our forecast period, as cross-border terrorism and the decades-long sovereignty dispute over Kashmir remain major hurdles. Relations with the Muslim-majority countries have deteriorated owing to the controversial remarks by the ruling party's former spokesperson, resulting in wide condemnation. However, we expect the impact to be moderate, as India remains a crucial commercial partner for those countries.

India's overall score in the EIU's business environment rankings rises sharply from 5.18 in 2017-21 to 6.21 in 2022-26, taking its global ranking to 54th out of the 82 countries assessed, from 64th in the historical period.
The improvement in India's score is mostly attributable to a stable political environment (despite upcoming national elections in 2024), higher foreign investment, improved tax coverage and lower trade controls. The huge opportunities presented by India's enormous population and growing economy contribute to a strong score for market opportunities: indeed, India ranks 19th globally in this category in 2022-26. The country will also score relatively well in technological readiness, largely reflecting its well-developed internet and telecommunications sectors. We expect the score for infrastructure to improve in 2022-26. Although political effectiveness will rise modestly, the coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains short of a majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament).
Business environment will see a broad-based improvement over 2022-26 The score for foreign trade and exchange controls will improve in 2022-26 as the BJP government, which is expected to return to office after elections in 2024, looks to support India's development as a centre for export manufacturing, via one of the BJP's signature initiatives, the Production Linked Incentives. Although India will shun regional trade blocs, it will work to strengthen bilateral trade relations with a multitude of partners like Australia, UK and the US. Its score for the labour market improves in the forecast period; although the pandemic delayed the implementation of four new labour reforms, we expect that they will be adopted to simplify and liberalise some of India's rigid labour market regulations, although adoption will be uneven.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2022-23: The government continues its drive to privatise inefficient state-owned companies (SOEs), particularly in the insurance sector, towing to the passage of the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Act in 2021.
2024-26: Rationalisation of liquidation and bankruptcy laws continues. Backlogs in courts start to clear up.
Policy towards foreign investment 2022-23: Temporary windows to apply for Production Linked Incentives attract foreign investors in sectors like pharmaceuticals. Targeted restrictions remain in place against Chinese investment, particularly in strategic sectors.
2024-26: Foreign investment in export manufacturing and e-commerce increases markedly.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2022-23: The government continues to support domestic manufacturing via tariff and non-tariff barriers under its "self-reliant India" campaign, but also unveils a new trade strategy aimed at promoting closer trade ties with major partners.
2024-26: The central bank makes limited progress towards improving capital-account convertibility, but the usage of the rupee for international trade with India rises moderately.
Taxes 2022-23: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) takes place, including a likely correction of the inverted duty structure (inputs being taxed at a higher rate than the final output). Disputes over retrospective taxes are fully resolved.
2024-26: The government includes more individuals and corporations under the tax ambit, raising government revenue.
Financing 2022-23: Borrowing costs rise, exacerbating strains in the banking sector. The inclusion of Indian bonds on global indices boosts foreign capital inflows.
2024-26: Consolidation continues. The "bad bank" achieves limited success in realising value from its stressed assets.
The labour market 2022-23: Unemployment in urban areas falls gradually, as do registrations under the rural employment guarantee scheme.
2024-26: Some labour reforms make headway. A phased implementation of the four new labour laws commences.
Infrastructure 2022-23: A dedicated freight corridor railway, connecting Mumbai with West Bengal, becomes operational by March 2023. The Gati Shakti initiative provides a one-stop digital platform for infrastructure projects, reducing bureaucratic red tape.
2024-26: India's infrastructure improves in terms of broadband connection speed, electricity, office space supply and distribution and transport infrastructure, including road and rail networks and ports.
Technological readiness 2022-23: Most technological innovation remains concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore.
2024-26: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, to cut corruption and promote "last-mile delivery". In this context, the Aadhar biometrics platform boosts government service delivery.

Healthy GDP growth will underpin macroeconomic developments India's score for macroeconomic environment remains unchanged in the forecast period, even as its position both globally and regionally improve to 51st and 14th respectively, from 54th and 15th in 2017-21, owing to setbacks among its closest peers in this category. India's growth will remain healthy over the forecast period, led by a strong acceleration in activity in sectors such as services and construction. Twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will persist in the forecast period. The current and next government will continue consolidating the fiscal deficit through a wider tax net and disinvestments of state-owned enterprises, while spending on infrastructure creation. The depreciation in the rupee will be more modest over 2023-26 than that over 2022, as geopolitical contagion due to the Russia-Ukraine war fades. India's current-account deficit will remain fairly manageable, at an average of 1.3% of GDP in the five years to 2026, while consumer price inflation will remain within the central bank's targeted band of 2-6%, after breaches seen in 2022. As the pressure from swift monetary tightening in the US abates, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, central bank) will embark on loosening monetary policy through rate cuts from 2024.

Stake sales will face resistance from vested groups but will proceed India's score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves from 4.5 in 2017-21 to 5.8 in 2022-26, partly as a result of efforts to privatise state-owned enterprises, which will reduce the distorting impact of the state sector on the economy. The authorities have, however, set more realistic targets for selling stakes in government enterprises, after three years of failing to achieve ambitious disinvestment revenue. The disinvestment target for 2022/23 (April-March) has been set at a realistic and modest Rs650bn (US$8.6bn), incorporating stake sales of state-owned banks and oil marketing companies. The privatisation drive received a significant legislative boost in August 2021, albeit specific only to the insurance sector. The passage of the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Act in August 2021 has opened the door for the government to reduce its stake in state-owned insurance companies in a material way. The changes have removed the obligation for the central government to own at least 51% of the equity in an insurer. Currently, there are four major state-run general insurers. Delays to planned sales will continue amid opposition from unions and other vested interests. More success is expected from the government's initiative to monetise its infrastructure assets. In 2021 the government laid out a Rs6trn pipeline of assets to be sold by 2025. The projects span sectors like roads, railways and power.

- Areas of improvement include stronger protection for private property and more secure rights for minority shareholders. Overall, the country's higher score will raise it ten spots in the global table, to 48th, while its regional rank edges up from 11th to 10th. The government has made progress on streamlining the bureaucracy, easing the approval process for industrial and infrastructure projects. It has also encouraged competition between states by allowing them to experiment on pro-business liberalisation over and beyond the regulations imposed centrally. Despite these state-level measures, however, the scope for improvement remains huge and more reforms will come in 2022-26.
- We expect the protection of intellectual property in India to improve over the next five years. This will reflect pressure from domestic companies to toughen enforcement as local levels of investment in research and development (R&D) increase, while this also remains a major stumbling block in free trade agreements that India is pursuing with the EU and the UK. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy, with courts in more developed parts of the country offering better levels of protection than those in poorer regions.
- The passage of the Tribunals Reforms Act in August 2021 should help to speed up the judicial process in commercial disputes. For example, the law has abolished the appellate boards under the 1957 Copyright Act, the 1970 Patents Act and the 1999 Trade Marks Act, transferring these functions to either the High Court, or its Commercial Division, or to the Commercial Court. The competitive environment should also be enhanced following the government's decision in February 2021 to amend the Companies Rules, paving the way for non-resident Indians to establish single-person companies. Moreover, amendments to what constitutes a small business should reduce the compliance burden; annual turnover can now rise to as high as Rs200m (US$2.5m), up from Rs20m, for these companies to be classified thus and to receive policy benefits directed to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
- Market-friendly reforms are likely to face resistance from vested interest groups, like the agriculture sector reforms, which were rolled back in 2021. However, we believe that the government's strong mandate will encourage controversial reforms on land and agriculture to be taken up after parliamentary elections in 2024.

India's score for policy towards foreign investment improves to 6 in 2022-26, from 5.5 in 2017-21, pushing the country up to 57th and 11th respectively in the global and regional rankings (from 62nd and 14th). The improvement is driven by friendlier government policy towards foreign capital. The NDA government, led by the BJP, has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime since 2014. Nevertheless, some important sectors of the economy, such as multi-brand retail, banking, pensions and media, will remain subject to hard foreign direct investment (FDI) caps and/or more onerous approval processes. Discrimination and restrictions against investment from China will persist for the next few years, as India strives to shield the domestic market from Chinese influence, amid strategic competition in the region. Overall, the country's investment appeal remains strong.
Foreign direct investment will grow beyond traditional sectors
- The government will seek to give added impetus to its "Make in India" campaign and the "self-reliant India" initiative, which seek to boost local manufacturing in 2022-26. Its primary tool will be the production-linked incentives introduced at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Nearly Rs2trn (US$25bn) in funds has been allocated to this initiative by 2025, targeting 14 sectors including medical devices, consumer electronics and white goods. In 2022 the government has widened the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) outreach to solar modules and semiconductors. Overall, this scheme, which provides monetary incentives for incremental sales of domestically produced goods, should complement the temporary cut in corporate tax rates introduced in 2019 for newly established manufacturing companies, as long as they started operations before March 2023. The impact of these initiatives on the economy will only be visible towards the end of our forecast period, owing in part to continued problems with the business environment in areas such as land acquisition, and intense competition for FDI from emerging markets in South-east Asia, especially for companies looking to shift operations out of China.
- We expect the e-commerce market to attract a considerable amount of FDI over the forecast period as US and European firms vie to establish a presence. The Reliance Jio platform, with more than 430m subscribers, will prove particularly attractive for foreign firms by offering a simpler way to operate in the Indian online technology market.

PLI schemes have garnered investment across multiple sectors
- Chinese investors used to participate actively in Indian internet start-ups. However, structural tensions between China and India will significantly reduce the former's presence. More broadly, the requirement introduced in 2020 for any investor from a bordering country to seek the government's approval for any investment, regardless of size and sector, was aimed ostensibly at blocking Chinese FDI. In practice, the stricter requirements have slowed, rather than stopped altogether, Chinese capital from flowing in. A Right to Information request lodged in July 2022 found that the authorities have approved 80 out of 382 proposals from Chinese investors since the new entry process was introduced in mid-2020. Nonetheless, long-standing tensions at the country's disputed border with China will ensure a continuation of this nationalistic posture, which has also included a ban on companies from border countries bidding on public contracts.

Import controls will ease as bilateral trade agreements are ratified The score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves substantially from 5.5 in the historical period to 7.3 in 2022-26, driving up India's global ranking by 12 spots to 57th, while its regional position rises by two places, to 13th. This progress is due to improvements in trade-related bureaucracy and mild deregulation of capital-account restrictions. In recent years the government has lowered an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under general schemes for goods and services. It has also invested in infrastructure; reduced costs through greater use of online platforms; permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures; and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. These measures form part of a broader effort to stimulate exports through supply-side reforms that are intended to boost the competitiveness of Indian exporters. However, tariff and non-tariff barriers have remained high in India, due in part to the country's reluctance to participate in regional free-trade agreements (FTA), as well as the strength of India's domestic business lobby. We expect the government to continue to sanction tariffs on selected manufactured goods in the coming years to promote domestic production. This will also encompass imports of military equipment, as several previously imported items (including ammunitions) have been put on the negative import list in 2022 to ensure a phased ban.

- Over 2022 India has met some success in strengthening bilateral trade relations with a number of countries. India and the UAE signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in February 2022, providing duty-free access for 90% of India's exports to the UAE and 65% of the UAE's exports to India, with further widening over the next decade. An interim agreement, the Australia-India Economic Co-operation and Trade Agreement, was signed in April 2022, while a final agreement is likely to be reached by early 2023 with a particular focus on strengthening trade in critical rare earth minerals.
- India and the EU relaunched the first round of formal free-trade negotiations in June 2022 after a hiatus of nine years. We believe that a diluted form of the deal is likely to be concluded over 2025-26, with negotiations continuing on other areas beyond that period A preliminary trade deal with the UK is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, paving the way for a broader FTA in 2023. Trade relations with the US will expand into the realm of defence acquisitions by India, and we expect India to be included in the US Generalised System of Preferences within the forecast period. A more limited trade deal focusing on sectors of major strategic interest, such as steel for India, seems likely from talks with the US.
- In July 2022 the RBI enacted a major structural reform to enable international trade to be settled in rupee instead of the traditional US dollar-denominated trade. However, the internationalisation of the rupee will take time, and is unlikely to make significant strides in 2022-26. Nevertheless, Indian exporters and importers will now have a mechanism to receive and make payments in rupee, militating against exchange-rate risks.

The corporate taxation regime will be stable and predictable India's score for taxes improves markedly to 6.1 in 2022-26, from 4.5 in 2017-21. This increase moves the country up to 52nd globally and 13th regionally, from its previous rank of 78th and 16th respectively. The higher score will be based on more generous fiscal incentives for investment, and a fairer and more seamless tax system, albeit from a relatively weak starting point. Although the government lowered corporate income tax rates substantially for domestic firms in 2019, the government also offers a lower 22% opt-in tax, down from the standard rate of 30%, to eligible firms that choose not to avail certain deductions. Meanwhile, a much lower 15% rate was introduced for newly established companies in the manufacturing sector. This followed a major reform in 2017, when the nationwide goods and services tax (GST) was introduced, replacing a slew of indirect central and state taxes and marked a significant step towards the creation of a single national market. Since its introduction, the GST Council (a group of ministers authorised to monitor and amend the tax) has taken measures to simplify the tax and streamline rates. In the latter half of the forecast period there will be additional impetus to widen the tax net by means such as increasing the capacity of the tax authorities, simplifying administration and clamping down on evasion.

- Collections from GST have been robust over 2020-21 despite the pandemic, and we expect this trend to improve further over 2022-26. The government will continue to rationalise GST rates and bring more items into lower tax brackets (although multiple tax slabs will remain in place). The inverted duty structure will also be corrected, wherein inputs are taxed at a higher rate than the final good or service. Several key items, including alcoholic drinks and petroleum products, will remain outside the GST net, as petrol duty remains vital for state public finance. Unpredictability will remain an issue, though, as rates are tweaked to cater for the current demands of the economy.
- Foreign companies are likely to have significantly more confidence in investing in India in the forecast period, following the passage in August 2021 of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act. This essentially abolished the risk of retrospective taxation for transfers of domestic assets, a real issue that has pitted the authorities for years against Cairn, a British oil and gas company, and Vodafone, a British telecommunications firm. Both of these disputes have since been settled.

Debt markets will open up for foreigners with bond index inclusion The score for financing improves from 5.1 in 2017-21 to 6.3 in 2022-26 as the quality of the financial regulatory system strengthens, and foreign investors gain deeper access into India's capital markets, and as access to investment finance improves. Accordingly, the country's global rank will improve by nine spots, to 50th, while it will rise by three places in Asia, to 10th. By definition, the government-guaranteed loans introduced during the covid-19 crisis in 2020 should not affect banks if they turn sour. However, if enough of them end up as non-performing loans (NPLs), the authorities' ability to fulfil those guarantees would be tested, given its-substantial budget deficit. In the most recent edition of the RBI's twice-yearly Financial Stability Report, published in June 2022, gross NPL ratio for commercial banks fell to a six-year low of 5.9% in March 2022. The proposed "bad bank", the National Asset Reconstruction Company, will facilitate the handling of non-performing assets accumulated by the public-sector banks.

- The pool of savings that can be channelled towards investment should improve in the forecast period, with the passage of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Act in August 2021. The changes aim to ensure that depositors receive up to Rs500,000 (US$6290) within three months after the RBI withdraws the license of a troubled lender, up from a previous guarantee of Rs100,000. The minister for finance, Nirmala Sitharaman, has revealed that following the approval of the changes in 2021, it currently takes up to ten years for depositors to get back their funds, only after the bank is fully liquidated.
- We expect financial regulation in India to improve throughout the forecast period. However, the insolvency law will be amended: as court cases involving the insolvency law are decided, they will set precedents that could underline the effectiveness of the law. Better bad-loan provisioning and stricter regulation will support an improvement in the sector's health towards the latter part of our forecast period, improving the availability of financing.
- Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, especially in rural areas. We believe that amid deterioration in asset quality due to the covid-19 pandemic, further bank recapitalisation will be necessary. This will prove politically and fiscally challenging, weighing on the ability of banks to fund private-sector credit growth. Privatisation of state-owned banks will help on this front, though progress on sales is likely to be sluggish in the early part of the forecast period.
- Priority-sector lending (minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives) will remain a feature of government policy throughout the forecast period. Indian commercial banks and foreign lenders with more than 20 branches in the country are currently required to provide 40% of their net bank credit to priority sectors, which include agriculture, housing and renewable energy.

India's score for the labour market will strengthen materially to 6.6 in 2022-26, from 5.4 in the historical period, moving the country up to 37th globally and 9th regionally, from its previous rank of 61st and 15th respectively. The improvement will be based on some relaxations in the country's strict labour laws, a general enhancement in the level of skills and the health of the workforce, as well as an improvement in wage levels. Progress on the liberalisation, simplification and harmonisation of labour laws is likely in 2022-26, given the passage of four new labour codes in 2020. That said, their benefits will only become apparent in the latter part of the forecast period. Progress will also be inhibited by opposition from trade unions (including those affiliated with the BJP).
Participation of women in the labour force will remain constrained
- The government completed the passage of four labour laws in 2020, on wages, social security, health and safety and industrial relations. Although they have yet to be implemented, their potential impact on the business environment is substantial. They will serve to consolidate around 75% of 40 central government laws that currently deal with the labour market. Firms will still have to navigate state-level legislation, as labour is within the list of responsibilities shared by both centre and local authorities. However, the four codes will establish a standard baseline for states to adhere to. One of the biggest areas of liberalisation is in the industrial relations laws, which will raise the threshold at which companies need government's approval before laying off staff. Colonial era rules markedly reduced the incentives for firms to grow beyond the current threshold of 100 workers.
- The government's skilling programmes to upskill the workforce will improve the quality of workers available. However, the sub-par level of primary education will hamper a swift improvement. The migration of qualified Indians to the West will also create a skills gap. However, the workforce will be far more productive than those in other South Asian countries.

Infrastructure creation will focus on roads, ports and power India's score for infrastructure improves markedly in the forecast period, albeit from a low base, to 5.5 from 3.8 in 2017-21. This will be enough to move the country up into the top 60 globally, while its regional position will rise two spots, to 11th. The improvement will be broad-based, but it will be driven in particular by faster broadband speeds and more adequate transport infrastructure, in terms of rail, air travel, ports, and road networks. Power supply should also be more reliable in 2022-26. Infrastructure improvements and expansion remain key priorities for the NDA government. We expect the bulk of public investment to be diverted to transport, energy and urban improvement projects. However, the pace of progress on projects that are already under way will remain constrained by slow land acquisition and delays in regulatory clearances (particularly environmental approvals).
The budget for 2022/23 lays out a substantial capital expenditure of Rs7.5trn, with spending geared towards important areas such as defence equipment, atomic energy, telecoms, metro rail projects, railway infrastructure, affordable healthcare and the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (an investment fund created by the government in 2015 to invest in infrastructure).

- Infrastructure will remain a priority in the government's spending mix over 2022-26. The budget for 2021/22 included Rs200bn to establish a dedicated financial institution-the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development-to spur construction activity. This institution started operations in 2022/23, and will eventually be bestowed with a Rs1trn lending facility. Ministries responsible for roads and railways have received record allocations in recent budgets, underscoring the government's commitment to boost interstate connectivity. Delays are likely to continue, but, once finished, these initiatives will bolster domestic goods and labour flows.
- India will make improvements in enhancing internet speed as well as connectivity. According to the International Telecommunication Union, the percentage of the population using the internet had risen to 43% by 2020 (the latest available data) from just 8% a decade earlier. The disparity is significant between rural and urban India, and the number of internet users in urban India rose by 4% to 323m in 2020, accounting for 67% of the urban population, while rural penetration remains much lower, although it is growing.

Infrastructure development will continue to be led by the government
- Progress on urban civic infrastructure projects, such as water supply, will be hindered by inadequate private-sector involvement. The limited returns on investment in these sectors mean that official efforts to draw in private-sector participation will struggle. The private sector will focus instead on areas that promise faster returns, such as airport construction, and there will be significant progress in these areas in 2022-26. In general, demand for infrastructure will continue to exceed supply by a significant margin in the forecast period.
- Two publicly funded connectivity projects, Bharatmala (road construction) and Sagarmala (port construction), will continue to be prioritised. The first phase of Bharatmala is aimed at connecting 550 of the country's districts through the highways network, from only 300 in 2017. The government plans to build highways totalling 18,000 km over 2022/23. A lack of capital investment constrains the expansion of railways capacity, but we expect it to pick up mildly over the forecast period.

Research and development will remain focal areas in India India scores respectably for technological readiness, improving from 5.2 in 2017-21 to 6.1 in the forecast period, because of a more conducive environment for e-commerce and an enhancement of information technology-ready government services. Accordingly, the country's global ranking will rise by six places to 53rd in 2022-26, while it will remain at 11th regionally. The country boasts a relatively advanced R&D infrastructure, owing in part to the education system's historical bias towards higher education institutions. This has facilitated the development of relatively research-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals and technology. India has also been an enthusiastic adopter of e-government systems, seeking to improve the effectiveness of public service delivery and reduce corruption, as made evident by the Aadhar biometric identity cards.

- We expect that the launch of 5G networks will contribute to higher internet speeds in urban areas from 2023. Bharti Airtel is expected to start 5G services in India by the end of 2022, while Reliance Jio is also on track to roll out its 5G network. India lags in terms of fixed broadband and mobile internet speed. According to the Speedtest Global Index, India ranked 72nd out of 182 countries in June 2022 for fixed broadband connectivity speed. Its ranking on mobile internet speed was poor, coming in at 118th place out of 139 countries. Charges for telecoms and internet services are low, making them broadly affordable for even the poorer households. The government's flagship Bharat Net project seeks to provide connectivity to 0.25m villages through optical fibre. The finance minister, Ms Sitharaman, clarified in February 2022 that the contracts for laying optical fibre connections in rural and remote areas would be awarded in 2022 and completed by 2025.

E-commerce is changing the face of India's retail business
- E-commerce has become the focal point of India's digital revolution, owing to factors such as a growing middle class, the availability of relatively cheap mobile connections and skilled labour to develop indigenous technology platforms. According to Indian Brand Equity Foundation, the Indian e-commerce market is expected to reach US$111bn by 2024 and US$200bn by 2026. Structural changes in spending behaviour prompted by the pandemic are likely to hasten the uptake of e-commerce, particularly in retail. The development of online commerce will also be facilitated by the government's Bharat-Net programme. The government's restrictions on e-commerce businesses will remain in place over 2022-26 to protect small brick and-mortar businesses, and policies in this space could be unpredictable, as this is a novel domain. Broadly, e-commerce will continue to expand in India, given the potential of the country's large and rapidly growing consumer class.
- India will leverage the technological ecosystem provided by Aadhar biometric identity cards in 2022-26. Aadhar provides residents with a unique identification number through a link with their biometric data. We expect that the system will allow both the government and the private sector to deliver official services, such as the transfer of benefits, more efficiently. However, it is also likely to face public scrutiny, amid privacy concerns.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government will prioritise fostering a sustained economic recovery in 2022. Infrastructure development will remain the government's focus. This will encompass the creation and upgrade of ports, logistics parks, roads and railway networks. Costs of logistics will gradually decline over the forecast period, with major roads, highways and freight corridors due for completion in 2022-23. India is also likely to make progress towards its climate goals.
The liberalisation of land-acquisition laws will be an area of attention for the improvement of the business environment, but any major progress in this area is unlikely before the national election in 2024, as it might provoke widespread protests from the farming community. The government has also revamped the military recruitment scheme in June, meaning that most hiring will now be made without pensions and subsidies, saving on personnel costs and freeing up resources for the upgrading of military equipment. The administration will make piecemeal changes to legislation related to commerce and regulatory requirements. EIU expects the government to be moderately successful in privatising state-owned enterprises (SOEs), even as it faces lukewarm interest from the private sector.

  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Government expenditure 16.0 16.5 16.6 16.2 15.9 15.7
Government revenue 9.3 10.0 10.7 10.7 11.0 11.2

In May 2022 the government reduced duties on petrol and diesel to mitigate the impact of spiralling consumer price inflation. The government also increased its budgeted fertiliser subsidy (which forms about 3% of total expenditure) by Rs1.1trn (US$14.1bn) amid a sharp increase in global prices for fertilisers. This was in line with our expectation of subsidy relief to ameliorate hardship for the electorally important farming population.
The budget for fiscal year 2022/23 (April-March) strives to improve the quality of government expenditure, with a focus on significant capital spending geared towards defence, energy, telecommunications, transport and infrastructure. However, lower duties on fuel and increased fertiliser subsidies will cost the exchequer an additional Rs2trn. The rate of a windfall tax for petroleum companies was cut on July 20th, shortly after its introduction on July 1st. We expect the government to modestly cut back on some capital expenditure on infrastructure to partially compensate for the cost of subsidies. However, the shortfall will remain and stand at an equivalent of 6.5% of GDP.
Expenditure commitments will remain elevated in 2023/24, owing to spending related to the national election, resulting in only a modest fiscal consolidation. The government will attempt to consolidate the public finances more quickly after the election, resulting in the budget deficit narrowing to 4.5% of GDP in 2026/27. This will also be helped by measures to widen the tax net and strengthened compliance norms. Rising interest rates will raise the costs of debt servicing, and public debt will remain significant, averaging 58.6% of GDP in the forecast period. Most of this will still be held domestically, reducing currency risks associated with external debt repayment. However, the federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true size of the deficit: the states' deficits and the liabilities of public-sector units represent an implicit fiscal burden on the central government.

Long-term interest rate (year-end) 6.3 7.2 7.2 6.9 7.0 7.2
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) undertook an off-schedule rate increase of 40 basis points in May, followed by a raise of 50 basis points at its scheduled meeting in June, to rein in persistent inflationary pressures. Inflation concerns, as well as aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) and consequent large portfolio investment outflows from India will influence the central bank's decision as the interest-rate differential with the US narrows. We expect the RBI to raise the policy rate by a total of 160 basis points in 2022.
We expect rates to be raised by 25 basis points in 2023, as consumer price inflation will remain high, albeit moderating from 2022. In 2024-25 the RBI, prompted by domestic elections, will switch to cutting policy rates, totalling 50 basis points, to support the domestic economy. This will bring the repo rate to 6% at the end of the tightening cycle at end-2023. Following cuts would bring the repo rate to 5.5% in end-2026, which is not high by historical standards.

Real GDP is expected to grow by 6.9% in year-on-year terms in 2022/23, slowing from 8.8% in 2021/22. Growth will benefit from the release of pent-up demand for contact-based services, especially in the context of recovered mobility. This has improved business confidence, while strong corporate earnings over the past few quarters will spur investment in sectors such as transport, information technology and pharmaceuticals. A favourable monsoon and better terms of trade for food will support rural incomes and consumption. Low inventories will keep construction momentum strong, especially for commercial real estate. Despite persistent rate increases over 2022, policy rates will remain low by historical standards, and we expect that financing conditions will remain low and are unlikely to deter a recovery in investment until late 2022. The government's capital spending budget will support infrastructure investment.
Factors that will weigh on growth in 2022/23 include a surge in raw material prices squeezing the profit margins of manufacturers and service providers. The pass-through of these higher prices to consumers will raise inflation and erode household purchasing power. Slower global growth over 2022 also means lower external demand for India's exports.
In the medium term, the privatisation of SOEs and progress on structural reforms, such as changes to the labour laws and strengthening performance of the manufacturing subsectors under investment incentive schemes, will provide support for economic growth. Nevertheless, the weakening of household and corporate balance sheets due to the pandemic and inflationary pressures, along with the government's attempts to limit expenditure growth to consolidate the fiscal account, will weigh on expansion. We expect economic growth in 2023/24-2026/27 to average 5% per year-slower than the annual average of 6.7% in 2015/16-2019/20.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The rate of economic recovery has been faster in urban areas than rural areas over 2021 and 2022, as urban income streams were less disrupted by the pandemic than their rural counterpart. We expect agriculture, which is a major rural occupation to gradually become less important in contributing to growth as the economy moves up the value chain and productivity improves. However, the primary sector will continue to employ around half of the population, and its share in GDP will contract only modestly from 15.5% of GDP in 2021/22 to 14.7% of GDP by 2026/27. Although the reform to liberalise the marketing of agriculture produce and create self-sufficiency introduced in 2020 was rolled back amid protests in 2021, we believe that it will be reintroduced in a more acceptable format after 2024, and will support the outlook for the agriculture sector. As employment opportunities open up in the secondary and tertiary sectors, there will be a gradual shift in employment away from agriculture.
Agriculture will remain dependent on the vagaries of monsoon rainfall There is significant scope for investment to enhance agricultural productivity, as almost half of all cultivable land remains without irrigation cover, and is dependent on annual monsoon rainfall, rendering the sector vulnerable to poor or unevenly distributed rains. The government has recognised this, and has increased funding for irrigation schemes and crop insurance. However, capital investment into agriculture will remain inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of short-term grants and subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers, who form an important vote bank. Income from agriculture will remain meagre, as subsistence farming will continue to be predominant. We forecast that the agriculture sector will grow by an annual average of 3.9% in2022/23-2026/27.
Manufacturing will gain traction as industries set up base in India The industrial sector will expand at a robust pace, as the business environment improves and the country's strong economic growth outlook attracts investment. We expect the sector to grow by an average of 5.7% per year in the forecast period, and that the share of industry in total GDP will increase slightly from 30.8% in 2021/22 to 31.9% in 2026/27. Manufacturing will remain concentrated in a few sectors such as cars, processed foods, engineering goods and garments in the early part of the forecast period, rendering it moderately vulnerable to swings in household and external demand. Government efforts to lift manufacturing employment and output will be effective in the latter part of the forecast horizon through initiatives such as product-linked incentives (targeting new investments in emerging sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, consumer durables and semiconductors) and the administration's special economic zone strategy, which aims to develop manufacturing hubs throughout the country. Some of the manufacturing capabilities relocating out of China will set up base in India amid low input costs. Persistently rising foreign direct investment (FDI) will be channelled to manufacturing sectors, as some liberalisation of the laws governing land acquisition and the labour regime (especially local sourcing) will help to underpin growth in the sector. Policy continuity will also bolster confidence in foreign investor sentiment. However, India's absence from major regional trade blocs will impede streamlined export productivity.
Services like travel, hospitality and domestic trade will continue to flourish Accounting for 53.7% of GDP in 2021/22, the services sector will remain the primary engine of economic expansion over 2022/23-2026/27. The sector has recovered strongly, albeit unevenly, from the severe disruption caused by the pandemic, and has shown itself to be resilient and not dependent on buoyancy in external markets. Its expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as telecommunications and business services, as well as by services in numerous high potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, retailing, hospitality and education. Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services will remain a major source of export revenue, even as growth will face increased competition from countries such as the Philippines. We expect the services sector to expand by an annual average of 5.7%; its share of GDP will rise to 55.7% by 2026/27.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Consumer prices 5.1 7.3 5.3 4.2 4.4 3.8
Average wages 6.2 9.4 8.3 7.5 8.2 7.3
Real wages 1.0 2.0 2.8 3.2 3.6 3.4
Unit labour costs (US$) 4.3 -1.8 1.6 4.2 3.0 2.3
We forecast consumer price inflation to accelerate to 7.3% in 2022, from 5.1% in 2021. Higher commodity prices in the wake of the Ukraine crisis will be passed on to consumers as the recovery in demand becomes more broad-based. Increased demand for discretionary services such as travel and recreation will create price pressures as well. Although the duty reduction on retail fuels will modestly cool transport price inflation over the next six months, increased demand for transport (due to the reopening of the economy) will mitigate that reduction to some extent. Although the monsoon season is expected to help to deliver a good harvest, this will cool food price pressures only in the last quarter of 2022. In the interim, the prices of perishable foods are expected to rise, while imported food inflation will rise through the channels of pulses and edible oil.
Consumer price inflation is expected to average 4.4% in 2023-26, near the midpoint of the RBI's 2-6% target band. Moderate economic growth over this period will reduce demand-side inflationary pressure. Supply-chain efficiency is also expected to improve, with improved logistics infrastructure. Given heavy reliance on seasonal rains for irrigation, a bad monsoon (which is not part of our forecast) would trigger a surge in food prices.
We forecast that producer price inflation will reach 15.5% in 2022, accelerating from 10.8% in 2021. This relates to high input costs generated by robust commodity prices and supply disruption. Producer price inflation will average 6.1% in 2023-26.

The Indian rupee depreciated by 5.5% nominally against the US dollar between January and June 2022, reflecting a narrowing interest-rate differential with the US and geopolitical contagion from the Ukraine war, which has reduced the appetite for emerging-market assets. The RBI has consequently intervened heavily to slow the depreciation of the rupee by selling its foreign-exchange reserves. This is likely to continue, with the central bank defending the rupee against a stronger depreciation, and we believe that the RBI has enough reserves to defend the currency over much of 2022 without concern over import payments or the repayment of external debt. Some support for the currency will come from robust economic performance, as well as significant policy rate increases by the RBI. Overall, we expect the rupee to depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar by 6.5% on average in 2022, with the currency standing at Rs81.4:US$1 at the end of the year, compared with Rs74.3:US$1 at end-2021.
We forecast that the rate differential with the US and a persistent current-account deficit will keep the local currency on a depreciatory trend. We expect the rupee to depreciate gradually between 2023 and 2026, moving from an annual average of Rs82.4:US$1 to Rs87.5:US$1 over that period, as portfolio investment flows are depressed in part by more conservative monetary policy in developed markets.

We forecast that India's current-account deficit will widen to 1.5% of GDP in 2022, from 1.1% of GDP in 2021, driven by a larger merchandise trade deficit resulting from higher import prices and the strengthening of import demand. However, elevated local prices will also curtail import demand for discretionary consumption items such as electronics and gems/jewellery. Nonetheless, merchandise exports will remain robust, the pace of expansion will ease sharply in comparison with 2021, given slower growth in major export destinations such as the UAE, the US and China.
The services and secondary income accounts will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period as India maintains its status as a leading exporter of IT services and continues to receive robust financial inflows from overseas Indians. However, this will not be enough to counter the large deficit on merchandise trade. As a result, the current account will remain in deficit in 2023-26, averaging the equivalent of 123% of GDP.
Our forecast assumes that tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well as strategic import substitution through incentive schemes under the government's "self-reliant India" initiative, will partly depress the goods import bill. India will continue to prioritise bilateral trade though pacts with friendly nations such as the UAE, the UK and Australia, and will continue to focus on bilateral rather than regional trade agreements. The country's absence from regional trade alliances will impede the government's efforts to establish the country as an export-orientated manufacturing hub.
The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, rolled out by the government for the domestic manufacture of electronics, pharmaceuticals, batteries and solar panels (among other products), will attract inflows of foreign direct investment. The move to incentivise semiconductor production under the PLI will, in the medium term, alleviate reliance on Chinese imports. A push to upgrade national infrastructure, coupled with the size of the market and a modest increase in access, will also create opportunities for foreign investors.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India Stocks and flows India's large market and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have been strong in recent years, averaging US$48.4bn in 2017-21, compared with US$35bn in the previous five years. Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$514.3bn in 2021 (markedly higher than in 2019, when it totalled US$427bn). The 2021 figure was also higher than the corresponding stock in Indonesia (US$259.3bn), but lower than in China (US$2trn).
Origin and distribution According to the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the largest source of FDI has historically been Mauritius, which accounted for 27% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2022. (Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons.) With a similar tax treaty and some of the lowest rates of taxation in Asia, Singapore stands in second place; the city state accounted for 22% of cumulative inflows in 2000-22. It was followed by the US (9%), the Netherlands (7%), Japan (6%) and the UK (5%). FDI inflows from the US and Singapore surpassed flows from Mauritius in 2021/22, amid improving interest in India. The most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$94.2bn between April 2000 and March 2022 and accounted for 16% of cumulative inflows, according to the DPIIT. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient (14% of cumulative flows), attracting US$85.5bn in the same period. The state of Maharashtra (which boasts the country's financial centre, Mumbai) attracts most FDI, garnering 28% of the total between October 2019 and March 2022. This was followed by Karnataka and Gujarat in the same period.
Determinants India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since taking office the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, insurance and single-brand retailing. It also provides a product-linked incentive that offers financial compensation for direct investments in emerging sectors such as electronics. The current administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed. Although structural reforms will make headway, difficulty in acquiring land, rules on local sourcing and hiring and firing of employees has loosened considerably, though disparities exist among states, with western and southern states having more flexible rules. The slow legal system also acts as a deterrent to the inflow of investment and hampers the ease of conducting business in India for foreigners.
Impact FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Although call centres and other forms of back-office administration have been important industries, India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, automobile, telecommunications and construction sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The online retail sector has gained importance over the pandemic, with US-based Amazon and Walmart (through its Flipkart subsidiary) having a significant presence in the e-commerce sector. Many online start-ups have been able to attract attention from venture capitalists and internet giants in the West. However, in offline retail, a significant relaxation of regulations for multibrand retailers is unlikely to occur in 2022-26. The product-linked incentive will spur investment in the electronics sector, but the sector is unlikely to expand significantly into a new pillar industry.
Potential Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI. However, the potential for even stronger inflows is reduced by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors are likely to be important areas for FDI in 2022-26. Biotechnology, electronics and vehicle manufacturing (including parts) could also attract significant interest over the next five years amid significant government support.

Population growth will slow as education rises and fertility rates fall EIU forecasts that the population will grow by an annual average of 0.8% in 2022-26, slightly slower than the 1% recorded in 2017-21. This marginal slowdown is linked to an improvement in living standards, urbanisation and economic conditions for women, which is depressing fertility rates. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2019-21, India's overall fertility rate has fallen to two per woman, lower than the replacement rate of 2.1-a level that is usually viewed as sufficient to replace a whole generation or keep the population from declining without immigration. However, disparities exist among the states of India. The populations of poor and populous states will continue to grow strongly, adding to social and familial tensions and exerting further pressure on the already overloaded infrastructure.
In 2021 men outnumbered women by 55m, and this trend will persist over the forecast period. Recent research from the National Family Health Survey shows that the gender ratio of newborns is 929 girls per 1,000 boys for the country as a whole, showing that gender selection is skewed towards males in most parts of the country. The disproportionate gender ratio also spills over to educational attainment and workforce contribution, as these are more available to men than women. Government policies targeted towards women's education and employment have seen uneven uptake in rural belts, which remain conservative and prioritise males. We expect this disparity to gradually even out with increased education among women. However, the proportion of women in the workforce is expected to remain low over the decade, as concerns such as house work, caregiving, safety and low wages compared to their male counterparts prevent women from joining the labour force in large numbers.
Caste-centric policies will continue to be enacted by successive governments Caste factors will be another important source of social strain within India in 2022-26. All governments have traditionally been supportive of affirmative action policies that favour caste-based "reservations" (quotas) for jobs and public services such as education, which may help those in low-status castes, and this will continue. Caste groups (including higher-status castes) that do not currently enjoy special job quotas, especially in public-sector jobs, will push for them in the next five years. Notably, castes can also influence policy decisions; the agriculture reforms were rolled back in 2021 owing to opposition by higher-caste farmers, who form an important vote bank. Regardless of the government's policy approach, the ongoing trend of workers moving from conservative rural regions to more metropolitan urban areas will help to slowly weaken the roots of the caste system.
Growth in the working-age population will remain relatively strong, at 1.3% per year on average in 2022-26. However, unlocking the economic benefits of population growth will prove challenging. In the 1990s and 2000s China was able to transfer workers from agriculture to more productive work in the cities, thereby boosting economic growth and exports. However, India's manufacturing sector has failed to take off in a similar manner. The manufacturing sector in India boasts more success in capital-intensive industries than their labour-intensive counterparts. Although the manufacturing sector is set to grow, advancing automation, which the government strongly supports, is likely to hamper sufficient job creation. The workforce moving out of agriculture will be increasingly absorbed in services, although low-skilled workers will still be largely employed in agriculture or construction sectors.
Educational focus will move from the public to the private sector A main challenge for the country's long-term development is the poor state of primary-level education. While enrolment rates have risen, educational outcomes remain sub-par, especially in state-funded schools. This reflects multiple factors, including underqualified and irregular teachers, the impact of caste within the education system and bad infrastructure within schools. The situation has resulted in strong demand (even among poor households) for private education, including online courses. The gap between primary education in rural and urban areas widened during the pandemic as a lack of technological availability in rural areas hampered education continuity. As technology becomes increasingly important for educational outcomes, this gap will widen, while the quality of state-funded education will remain sub-par.
Weaknesses in other parts of the education system will also come to the fore as more students seek secondary and tertiary education. Few universities operate at world-class levels barring a few clusters of excellence, and more skilling initiatives will be needed to bridge the gap in employability.

Robust personal income will spur discretionary consumption EIU expects personal disposable income to exceed the levels recorded before the onset of the pandemic. India's huge population will become an increasingly important market for consumer goods. Household consumption expenditure will rise from US$1.9trn in 2021 to US$2.6trn by 2026. However, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain low at just US$2,819 in 2026, compared with US$17,197 in China. This will limit the bulk of consumer spending to food and essential items, especially in rural areas. Discretionary consumption will remain more prevalent in urban areas, given a growing number of middle-class households and a desire to purchase premium products, which offers considerable potential for suppliers of higher-value products and services. The rapid growth in personal incomes from 2021, combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies. Significant regional economic disparities exist, and the levels of opportunity for retail businesses will vary greatly across the country in the forecast period.
Opportunities for e-commerce will grow rapidly in urban areas, owing to their increasingly well-educated populations and the growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Foreign firms are positioning themselves to take advantage of this trend. Assuming that the economy maintains its solid growth path in 2022-26, and as internet and logistics availability rises, e-commerce will claim more of the country's consumer market, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms. Nevertheless, regulation will provide some obstacles to their competitive capacity. The administration has imposed strict restrictions on retail-related e-commerce businesses to protect the interests of small brick-and-mortar businesses, as well as domestic e-commerce businesses. However, foreign companies see these measures as discriminatory, and the government will come under pressure to revise them in 2022-26.
Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty, especially to high-end brands, than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians, price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address affordability by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice serves as a way to develop brand loyalty among new consumers.

As in most developing countries, food constitutes by far the largest category of consumer expenditure. However, spending on food as a percentage of income will consistently fall in 2022-26, as improving income allows more spending beyond food items. Spending on transport and communications will increase as mobility around India improves. The relatively poor state of government-provided services means that as Indians become richer, they will spend an increasing amount on private education.
Regional and cultural divergences will drive different consumption trends Several factors other than income must be weighed carefully when assessing prospects in the Indian market. First, purchasing power is as location-specific as it is income-sensitive, and prices can vary considerably from city to city as well as between urban and rural areas. Second, cultural factors matter to a significant degree. Third, Indian consumers, including those who are moving up the income scale, are highly price-conscious. Fourth, it is important to note that there is hardly a single consumer characteristic that applies across the entire country. India is a collection of widely varying markets, necessitating region-specific strategies. Finally, the steady expansion of consumer finance options will increase the willingness of consumers to purchase in the forecast period.

Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reform and market liberalisation. Since then, India's GDP has expanded rapidly, with annual real GDP growth averaging 6.3% in fiscal years 1991/92-2021/22 (April-March). However, India's share of world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains low, at around 3.4% in 2021, compared with its 19% share of the world's population. This highlights significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for widespread poverty. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries such as information technology (IT) is vast. Corruption is still endemic in local authorities, despite the fact that attempts to reduce graft have made progress at the higher levels of government under the Bharatiya Janata Party (which has led the ruling coalition since 2014). India's courts have long suffered from crippling understaffing, and a case backlog has built up over decades. The judiciary remains largely independent despite some pressure from the government.
Automation will dampen employment opportunities to a certain extent Demographic trends: Continued growth in the working-age population over 2022-50 will support India's economic expansion. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will not find employment in productive formal-sector jobs. A mismatch between the skill level of the country's workers and the demand for highly educated staff from employers will persist for at least the next two decades, as the quality of education provided by the government (on which a large portion of the population depends) and vocational training systems remain poor. Meanwhile, the rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will dampen employment gains, even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of global manufacturing. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove difficult in this environment. EIU expects the vast majority of the workforce to be absorbed in low-productivity occupations in the urban services sector and the agricultural sector in 2022-50. Still, opportunities for better-educated Indians will proliferate amid rapid growth in professional services, manufacturing and high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharmaceuticals.
Persistent rural to urban migration will pressure infrastructure and resources Divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. In the absence of major improvements in governance, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be a source of internal migrants, putting pressure on scarce resources in more prosperous and economically dynamic cities such as the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai. Although there is divergence in fertility rates among states, fertility rates have dropped below two (the replacement level) in 2021 for all states but five in India, according to the National Family Health Survey. Therefore, population growth will slow, gradually alleviating pressure on scarce resources, athough this will only happen over the next two decades Significant levels of internal migration will be a source of political and social tensions. Meanwhile, workers will continue to look abroad for economic opportunities, with lower-skilled workers preferring the Gulf region, while skilled workers will migrate to the US and Canada. The migration of skilled workers will cause a "brain drain" that hampers the growth of India's high-technology sectors. Inflows from their remittances over the next few decades will be an important driver of economic activity in some states.
India's strategic power will grow consistently, wielding regional influence External conditions: As its economy expands, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and to cultivate ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival and China, with which India shares a border dispute. We expect India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences, especially on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Temporary bouts of high tension are likely. However, the growth differential between India and Pakistan will remain high, and India's military advantage over its rival will increase. Over time, this should deter Pakistan from initiating overt conflict, although that country will resort to terrorism attacks, which will provoke a strong covert or overt military response from India. China's presence in South Asia (especially in Pakistan) will push India towards adopting a more defensive posture to shield its domestic market from China. Shared strategic and economic interests will bind India more closely to the members of the Quad (an informal diplomatic grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India), most notably Japan and the US. India will also prioritise groupings initiated by the US, such as the I2U2 group comprising India, Israel, the UAE and the US, while simultaneously reducing its participation in China-inclusive blocs like BRICS, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Still, even as it becomes a major diplomatic power, India will remain hesitant to align itself fully with the West. This is partially related to India's traditionally strong relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement in these regions over the period to 2050. India will share strong bilateral strategic and economic relations with most nations despite not aligning or engaging in multilateral trade blocs over the longer term.
States in the west and south will perform better on all parameters Institutions and policy trends: Political power will be centralised under the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the 2020s, although regional parties will emerge as dominant players in the policy space, especially on matters over which states have the final say in legislation. Differences in policy approach at state level will have a significant impact on economic outcomes. Reform-minded states will see growth accelerate, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to balance economic disparities. Despite state-level differences, India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will generally remain impartial (but slow) and the constitution will be respected (apart from a trend away from secularism, which is likely to dim after Mr Modi leaves office). Pledged reforms on labour law and land acquisition will make progress in 2021-30. India's integration into regional and global value chains will nonetheless be constrained by a lingering tendency towards protectionism. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft, particularly at the local level.
Technology adoption and reforms will keep the growth trajectory robust Long-term performance: We forecast that India's real GDP growth will average 5.1% per year in 2022-50. The country's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment and help to enhance the economy's performance. Improvements in the adoption of technology and greater supply-chain efficiency in the agricultural sector will make rural India more resilient to climate change. A stronger agricultural sector and declining fertility rates will partly temper the movement of people from rural to urban areas, and the urban population will overtake its rural counterpart only by the middle of this century. However, the shift of the workforce from rural labour into more productive urban jobs will remain the leading driver of India's economic expansion in the period to 2050. One major concern over the country's long-term economic performance is the extent to which the government can manage this transition. Upgrading the quality of public education will be crucial if the government is to achieve this successfully. We expect gradual progress on this front in the decades ahead; this will enable the expansion of the manufacturing sector, which will be crucial to India's medium-term growth prospects. A gradual improvement in the quality of education will also lay the groundwork for the development of the higher-value-added sectors that will be necessary to sustain the country's growth momentum in the longer term. A much faster pace of improvement in education and much deeper reforms in business regulations would produce a more significant level of economic growth over the long term; however, this is not part of our central forecast, and the economy will thus expand at a slower pace than its long-term growth potential.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability India will be highly vulnerable to climate change, and adverse changes in monsoon patterns could severely affect its agricultural sector, which remains greatly dependent on monsoon rain. More generally, water scarcity will become a challenge. Frequent floods have also led to massive disruption of business activity. The government has taken steps to manage the effects of climate change. However, given the scale of the environmental challenges that India faces, policy measures are unlikely to reduce the country's vulnerability to climate change significantly. India's energy demand will continue to grow over the forecast period, making it difficult to move away completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. The government is making efforts to diversify from conventional sources of energy, such as coal-fired thermal power stations. However, transitioning away from a coal-based economy will be very gradual, given the sheer numbers dependent on the coal economy as a source of livelihood.
Under the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, India has made continuous strides in bolstering its renewable energy credentials. The installed renewable energy capacity has risen to 160.9 GW in June 2020 from 119.5 GW in December 2018. In November 2021 the prime minister, Narendra Modi, set a target for India to become a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050. India is one of the most active members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which promotes the transition to solar energy, and the ISA has established its headquarters in Gurugram, near the country's capital, New Delhi. India is likely to use the platform to leverage funding and assistance from developed nations and multilateral agencies to develop its own solar farm sector.
The country has also been making strides in developing wind energy. The National Institute for Wind Energy has estimated India's wind-power potential at 302 GW, with the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan having the greatest potential. India's installed capacity in wind energy is now the world's fourth largest. In 2019 EIU developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Indian economy will be 3.7% smaller in 2050 than it would have been otherwise without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation India will continue to experience an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities for better-paid jobs. Social policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will increasingly have to tilt towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, inadequate urban infrastructure and declining sustainability in urban centres. The construction of urban mass-transit systems will increase, along with other urban infrastructure such as roads, sanitation and power grids. However, the enormous scale of these challenges will temper the pace of progress. The biggest challenge for policymakers will be training the workforce of rural migrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agriculture sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry. Meanwhile, emigration to Western countries, particularly the US and Canada, as well as to the prosperous states of the Gulf, such as the UAE, will remain strong. As a consequence, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows the EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by the EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2017-21) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2022-26). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by the EIU for 2017-21. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2022-26 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; the EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2017-21 ranges are then used to derive 2022-26 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2022-26, not to the likely situation in 2026 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2019 or 2024). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.
