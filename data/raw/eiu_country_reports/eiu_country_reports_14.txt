Full text: India--highlights: Political outlook
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a second consecutive majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) in the April-May 2019 general election. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, will retain tight control over the government in the next five years. The government's move to revoke the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir will lead to an escalation of violence in the region and a deterioration in relations with Pakistan. The risk of related terrorist attacks in the state and in India's big cities will rise. The government's Hindu-nationalist agenda will cause social tensions within India to rise over the longer term. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to tighten controls over the media gradually in the next five years.

The business environment will improve in 2019-23, owing in part to increased political effectiveness and the gradual implementation of reforms that will both open up the economy and boost investment in infrastructure. The rise in India's overall score is driven by higher scores for infrastructure, policy towards private enterprise and competition and foreign exchange and trade controls. However, its scores for many aspects of the business environment are still poor by global standards, and its economy will retain a relatively poor ranking in 2019-23, at 60th out of the 82 economies assessed.

Economic growth in fiscal years 2019/20-2023/24 (April-March) will be below potential, averaging 6.6% annually, owing to the government's hesitation in undertaking productivity-enhancing structural reforms and its market-distorting support for small businesses. The Indian rupee will face downward pressure over the next five years, owing to the country's chronic current-account deficit and relatively high rates of inflation. However, it will strengthen against the US dollar in 2020, owing to loosening in US monetary policy. We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to hold policy interest rates unchanged during the remainder of 2019, but to implement a cut in the first half of 2020. Recent erosion of the RBI's independence will result in consumer price inflation trending slightly above the central bank's target of 4% over 2020-23.

India's economy will benefit from a growing population, and the labour force will expand by 1.3% a year on average in 2019-23. However, reaping the full benefits of its young population will prove immensely difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities. Large skills gaps will persist owing to inadequacies in the education system. The tertiary education sector will broadly under-perform, with the exception of a few pockets of excellence. Underemployment and unemployment will add to social tensions. This will be exacerbated by a wide gender imbalance and the government's Hindu-centric policy focus. Continued migration into towns and cities from the countryside will also generate economic and social stresses.

Strong GDP growth will support the outlook for wage growth and assist the expansion of the middle class, even as average national GDP per head remains low, at US$3,008 in 2023. The consumer market will continue to grow, supported by rapidly rising income levels among the huge population of around 1.4bn. We also anticipate rapid growth in the number of households able to afford relatively high-value products. The e-commerce sector will expand strongly on the back of higher smartphone and internet penetration rates and rising urban demand.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
We expect India to become the world's third-largest economy by 2031, supported by a shift in employment from rural to urban areas. However, a divergence in economic fortunes at individual and state levels will lead to social and political tensions. India's growing economic might will make it an increasingly influential diplomatic force. Owing to shared strategic geopolitical and economic interests, India will move closer to the US and Japan. The continuing rivalry for influence in South Asia will weigh on ties with China.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.34bn people in 2017, according to the UN. Its economy was the sixth-largest in the world in 2017 when measured in nominal US dollars, but the third-largest at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be shallow.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2019-23, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is technically secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched, and free and fair elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades. The country's two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which governed the country for decades, often in coalition with smaller regional parties. Regional parties are prominent in many state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics through the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). The BJP holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) and governs with the support of smaller parties in the NDA.
The BJP's ideological approach leans towards Hindu nationalism, mixing social conservatism with a more aggressive foreign and security policy. Its growing dominance of national and state governments has thus challenged India's secular tradition. The party has moved recently to extend its vote base beyond its roots in the urban middle class by adopting more rural-focused policies. Congress has a more centre-left ideological approach to socio-economic issues.

Political outlook: Political stability
The BJP won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) grouping control 352 of the 543 elected seats in the lower house (the largest majority since 1984). In addition, they control governments in a majority of states. This will underpin broad political stability. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's dominance of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure consistency in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the recent election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Sporadic instances of street violence occurred during the term of the first Modi government, directed particularly towards minority groups. The BJP's right-wing affiliates and sister organisations within the larger Hindu right-wing ecosystem (colloquially known as the Sangh Parivar) used the BJP's political power to pursue their socio-cultural agenda. This includes a goal of recasting India as a Hindu state-a view that puts them at odds with the country's large Muslim minority. Such attacks will persist over the forecast period, but we do not expect them to have a major impact on the business environment.
There is a risk that clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have increased in recent years amid concerns among some Hindu groups about an influx of people from the neighbouring Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh. However, state governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, in order to avoid public criticism and international scrutiny.
The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir will result in a marked deterioration in political stability in that region. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, we expect violence to escalate. It will persist over the medium term, with immigration by Hindus into Muslim-dominated parts of the Kashmir valley likely to be a particular source of tension. The government's move will also increase the risk of related terrorist attacks in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness in 2019-23 is mixed. The BJP dominates the political landscape at national and-increasingly-state level. The party has full control of the lower house, and its re-election in 2019 will help to bolster policy effectiveness. It has also been able to expand gradually its presence in the Rajya Sabha, where it is likely to gain a majority (with its NDA allies) in 2021. It will then be able to pass legislation without approval from the opposition. This will ease the passage of laws in parliament, although we believe that the BJP's growing dominance will also result in greater levels of corruption within the party.
Over the next few years the BJP is likely to suffer from anti-incumbency sentiment, which will be aggravated by increased collaboration between regional parties to oppose it at state level. This is likely to result in a weaker performance in state elections over the next five years, although the party will remain the dominant force within government in many states and its capacity to drive policy at the regional level will remain powerful.
The BJP has been an advocate of so-called competitive federalism, which encourages competition between India's states. We believe that this approach will lead to a notable improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west. However, it is also likely to deepen economic disparities between India's more economically successful states and its laggards, increasing social friction, competition for fiscal resources and pressure for migration between regions.
The BJP's dominance of national and state politics will have a corrosive impact on institutional checks and balances within India during 2019-23. There have already been signs that the government has successfully pressured media groups to rein in critical coverage. The independence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) has also been eroded. There remains a significant risk that the government will engage in a major confrontation with the judiciary at some point in the next five years, particularly if judges overturn a key policy decision, such as the move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Judicial challenges to the government's policies towards minority religions could also be a point of friction.
Political outlook: Election watch
In the second half of 2019 assembly elections will be conducted in three states-Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana. The BJP and its allies currently have over 85% of all available Lok Sabha seats in these three states, and we expect the outgoing BJP governments in all three to secure a second term in office.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they are significantly short of a majority. Given the BJP's strong performance in the general election, we now believe that the party will dominate the upcoming state elections, enabling it to nominate more members to the upper house (Rajya Sabha members are elected by state assemblies). The NDA is therefore expected to achieve a majority in the Rajya Sabha by mid-2021. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval.
Political outlook: International relations
A major attack in February 2019 by separatist militants on military personnel in Indian-administered Kashmir raised tensions between India and Pakistan and resulted in clashes between the two nations' military forces. Tensions will be heightened further by the India government's revocation of the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's response will be constrained by its foreign-exchange shortages, which will limit it to low-cost strategies. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there, similar to the incident in February. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2019-23, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence. To this effect, India has boosted security co-operation with the US in recent years, and this will continue in our forecast period.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2019-23.

India's overall score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises to 5.76 in 2019-23, from 5.24 in 2014-18. However, improvements elsewhere mean that its global ranking rises only marginally to 60th out of the 82 countries assessed, from 61st in the historic period. Among its BRICS peers, India scores better than Russia (5.47) but fares worse than Brazil (6.25), China (6.13) and South Africa (6.10). India's score is dragged down by weak ratings for infrastructure and the labour market. Despite improvements in these scores in 2019-23, they will remain the worst-rated areas of the business environment.
The huge opportunities presented by India's enormous population and rapidly growing economy contribute to a strong score for market opportunities: indeed, India ranks third in the world in this field in 2019-23. The country will also score relatively well in terms of technological readiness, largely reflecting its well-developed telecommunications and internet sectors. Political effectiveness will be bolstered when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secures a majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) in 2021, improving the political environment.
Restrictions on foreign investment will be liberalised modestly
We see the score for foreign trade and exchange controls improving in 2019-23 as the government looks to support India's development as a centre for export manufacturing. However, the modest liberalisation of restrictions on foreign investment that we expect will not be sufficient to raise the score for policy towards foreign investment. Indeed, in the areas of financing, taxes and policy towards private enterprise and competition India will remain a global laggard. While the country will still draw high levels of inward investment seeking to tap its huge market opportunities, the difficult business operating environment for both foreign and local firms will serve as a drag on productivity, holding back the economy's potential.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government remains protective of local businesses in certain sectors, leading to disputes with foreign countries. However, efforts are made towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2021-23: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closing of loss-making businesses and their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government seeks to promote foreign investment in some sectors, such as renewable energy. Restrictions on foreign investment in sectors such as insurance, aviation and media are eased. Sourcing controls on foreign investment in single-brand retail are also liberalised.
2021-23: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few geographic regions. Foreign firms become a more notable force in Indian e-commerce, prompting a politicised pushback by some local players.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2021-23: The government makes some efforts to further ease the process of borrowing overseas for companies, and to reduce capital-account restrictions. However, full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes
2019-20: The number of firms eligible to benefit from a reduced tax rate of 25% (against the norm of 30%) increases as the revenue threshold is raised. Effective tax rates for high-earners rise significantly.
2021-23: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST). The GST is rationalised, with the number of tax rate bands being reduced. The government moves to lower tax rates for smaller firms.
Financing
2019-20: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2021-23: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, as most public-sector banks struggle with lingering bad-debt issues.
The labour market
2019-20: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2021-23: Some labour reforms make headway at the state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure
2019-20: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2021-23: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its completion target of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore.
2021-23: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

The erosion of the central bank's independence will push up inflation
India's score for the macroeconomic environment remains at 6.6 in 2019-23, and the country's global ranking in this area remains unchanged. Although we have recently revised down our medium-term growth forecasts for India, we still expect it to be among the fastest-growing economies in the world during the period. Twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will remain one of the weakest aspects of India's macro-economic environment. Nevertheless, the current-account deficit will be significantly lower as a share of GDP in the next five years than it was in the previous five, which will help to improve exchange-rate stability. Fiscal pressure will persist, despite rising tax collection, as the government outspends its receipts to fund burgeoning development projects. Nevertheless, we anticipate that consolidation efforts will intensify in fiscal year 2021/22 (April-March) resulting in a modest narrowing of the budget deficit. The erosion of the independence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) in recent years will weaken the management of monetary policy. We thus expect that consumer price inflation will remain relatively high in 2019-23. Asset prices are also likely to become increasingly over-inflated as interest rates are kept low by a compliant RBI.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves to 5.3 in 2019-23, from 4.5 in 2014-18, largely owing to privatisation efforts (which will reduce the distorting impact of the state sector on the economy) and efforts to trim bureaucratic regulations. However, owing to progress elsewhere this significant improvement in the score has little impact on India's global or regional rankings in this category.
The government has made progress on streamlining the bureaucracy and merging some ministries, easing the approval process for industrial and infrastructure projects. It has also encouraged competition among states by devolving power to them to experiment locally with pro-business liberalisation. The pioneers in this process have been the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, as well as the western state of Gujarat and the northern state of Haryana. Tamil Nadu, for example, is in the process of implementing its Business Facilitation Act of 2018, which seeks to integrate many approval processes (such as building permits and water connections) into a single portal. Despite these state-level measures, however, the scope for improvement remains immense.
The government's privatisation plan will achieve some notable successes
The government has gradually raised targets for disinvestment (a term that includes privatisation receipts) and seeks to raise Rs1.1trn (US$15.8bn) in 2019/20. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) administration has habitually fallen short of its disinvestment targets, and delays to planned sales will continue amid opposition from unions and other vested interests. Nevertheless, we expect the government to achieve substantial levels of privatisation in 2019-23, including the sale of loss-making entities such as Air India and a telecommunications firm, MTNL.
The government's drive to expand the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs), notably in rail and digital communications infrastructure projects, will create opportunities for private firms in the next five years. However, there is a substantial risk that firms will experience problems in correctly pricing bids for such projects, which may render many unprofitable.
We expect the protection of intellectual property in India to improve over the next five years. This will reflect pressure from domestic companies to toughen the enforcement regime as local levels of investment in research and development increase. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy, with courts in more developed parts of the country offering better levels of protection than those in poorer regions.

India's score for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged at 5.5 in 2019-23. However, its global ranking drops from 62nd to 65th as other countries make greater headway in their efforts to attract foreign investors. The NDA government, led by the BJP, has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime in recent years and has clarified in the 2019/20 budget that this will continue over its current term. Nevertheless, some important sectors of the economy, such as multi-brand retail and banking, remain subject to foreign investment caps. Partly in response to liberalisation (as well as India's rapid economic growth), levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) in India have increased, from an annual average of US$31.3bn in the five years to 2010 to US$41bn in the five years to 2018.
The government will seek to give added impetus to its "Make in India" campaign, which seeks to boost local manufacturing over 2019-23. Notably, it will offer added tax incentives to major foreign investments in advanced production fields such as semiconductors, solar cells, lithium batteries and servers. We expect these efforts to achieve some success, but the overall impact of Make in India will remain limited, partly owing to continued problems with the business environment in fields such as land acquisition.
More restrictions on foreign investment are being pared away
The 2019/20 budget highlighted the government's plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in the insurance sector, as well as for firms engaged in animation, gaming, comics and visual effects. It will also ease local sourcing requirements for firms in the single-brand retail sector, while also liberalising restrictions on foreign portfolio investment in fields such as real-estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts. We believe that these changes will be implemented over the next two years.
India's new e-commerce rules, which came into effect in February 2019, have generated opposition from foreign investors in the sector. The rules notably bar companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and from establishing special arrangements with suppliers to sell exclusively on their sites. A news agency, Reuters, reported in mid-2019 that a US retail giant, Walmart, had argued that the rules discriminate between large foreign e-commerce companies and their domestic counterparts. The issue is likely to be a point of discussion between negotiators seeking to resolve India-US trade tensions. Given the evolving state of e-commerce legislation in India, the rules are likely to be revised in 2019-23 in a way that addresses some of the complaints of foreign investors.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves significantly to 6.9 in the forecast period, from 5.1 in 2014-18, resulting in an improvement in India's global and regional rankings in this category. This progress is due to significant improvements in trade-related bureaucracy and modest deregulation of capital-account restrictions. In addition, some headway will be made on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers in 2019-23. In recent years the government has lowered an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under two general schemes-one for goods and one for services. It has also invested in improved infrastructure; it has reduced costs through greater use of online and mobile platforms, permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. These measures have formed part of a broader effort to stimulate exports through supply-side reforms that are intended to boost the competitiveness of Indian exporters.
Full liberalisation of capital controls remains unlikely
The RBI has relaxed rules on overseas borrowing on several occasions in recent months, partly in order to offset relatively tight domestic credit conditions. The liberalisation of rules governing outward investment and overseas borrowing will continue in 2019-23, but numerous restrictions on the free movement of capital will remain in place.
Negotiations between India and the EU on a proposed free-trade agreement (FTA) have been stalled since 2013 owing to disagreement on a few contentious issues, and the deal is unlikely to be revived in the forecast period. We also believe that Indian objections will prevent the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), an Asia-focused multilateral FTA, in 2019-23. India has a patchy record on trade liberalisation, and the government has often resorted to protectionism in the face of threats to domestic industry from foreign competitors.
India and the US have engaged in a low-level trade conflict during 2019. The US announced in March that it would be withdrawing India's access to its preferential Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) trade scheme, and India in return imposed tariffs on a number of US products, such as almonds and apples. We do not expect this issue to be resolved as long as Donald Trump remains the US president. However, based on our forecast that a Democrat candidate will win the presidency in 2020, we expect the US to reprioritise the strategic relationship over its bilateral trade deficit and to come to a negotiated settlement that will see India's GSP status reinstated in return for relatively minor concessions.

India's score for taxes rises to 5.6 in 2019-23, from 5 in 2014-18. As a result, the country's global and regional rankings improve. The nationwide goods and services tax (GST) introduced in July 2017 was one of India's biggest tax reforms in decades. It replaced a slew of indirect central and state taxes and marks a significant step towards the creation of a single national market. Since the roll-out of the tax, the GST Council has met regularly and taken measures to simplify the tax and cut its rates. (The GST Council comprises a group of ministers authorised with deciding changes to the rate and structure of the tax.) Several landmark tax disputes between the Indian authorities and major foreign investors have arisen in recent years, involving claims of expropriation and retrospective changes of tax regulation. Some have been resolved (a major case with Nokia of Finland was settled in 2018), but several cases remain in the courts and continue to cast a cloud over the country's reputation as an investment destination.
As collections from the new tax pick up, the government will continue to rationalise GST rates and to bring more items into lower tax brackets, although multiple tax slabs will remain in place. Several key items, including alcoholic spirits and petroleum products, will remain outside the GST net.
Foreign investors will remain wary of the government's opaque tax regime, highlighted by the risk of retrospective changes to tax laws. Public concerns over tax evasion have led the government to increase the regulatory power of tax authorities, raising concerns of overreach in a country where tax laws remain complex.
Corporate tax rates will fall for smaller firms
The NDA government will continue to reduce corporate taxes, particularly for smaller companies. In the budget for 2018/19, the reduced 25% corporate tax rate applicable for businesses with turnover of up to Rs500m (US$7.2m) was extended to firms with turnover of up to Rs2.5bn (US$35.8m). The 2019/20 budget extended this to those with turnover of up to Rs4bn. Meanwhile, efforts to widen the tax base by increasing the capacity of tax authorities and identifying non-compliers will continue.

The score for financing improves from 5.1 in 2014-18 to 5.5 in 2019-23. However, India's position in the global rankings deteriorates from 57th to 65th as other countries make greater progress in this area. A number of massive bank fraud cases have emerged in recent years, including an alleged US$1.4bn fraud at Punjab National Bank. In connection with this, charges have been laid against a jewellery mogul, Nirav Modi (no relation of the prime minister). As regulatory scrutiny was toughened, more than 6,800 cases of alleged fraud involving Rs715bn were uncovered in 2018/19, according to the RBI. The bad debts associated with these (and other pre-existing problems in the banking sector) are beginning to recede, aided by reforms that have helped to smooth the judicial process associated with bankruptcy procedures. In its biannual Financial Stability Report published in June 2019, the RBI indicated that it expects the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in the banking sector to fall to 9% by March 2020, from 9.3% a year earlier. Unfortunately, as bank lending has slowed in recent years, companies have turned to non-bank financial companies for credit, and problems in this segment of the financial sector are now emerging as well.
We expect financial regulation in India to improve throughout the forecast period. However, the insolvency law will probably need to be amended: as court cases involving the relatively new law are decided, they will set precedents that could underline the effectiveness of the law. Better bad-loan provisioning and stricter regulation will support an improvement in the sector's health towards the latter part of our 2019-23 forecast period, improving the availability of financing.
A massive recapitalisation of state banks looms
Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, especially in rural areas. The capacity of state-owned banks to increase lending has been held back in recent years as they sought to address balance-sheet weaknesses. However, in the 2019/20 budget the government announced plans for a Rs700bn capital injection into public banks, which should help to reinvigorate their lending over 2019-23. Worryingly, there is little chance that this will be accompanied by reforms to improve lending practices. However, we expect the largest public-sector lender (also the overall largest bank), the State Bank of India, to perform better than smaller state-run lenders, owing to its better bad-loan provisioning and significant improvements in its corporate governance standards.
Priority-sector lending (minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives) will remain a feature of government policy throughout the forecast period. The RBI will continue to push both state-owned and private banks to meet priority-sector targets. Indian commercial banks and foreign lenders with more than 20 branches in the country are currently required to provide 40% of their net bank credit to the priority sectors, which include agriculture, housing and renewable energy. A significant reduction in this target is unlikely in 2019-23.

India's score for the labour market improves marginally from 5 in 2014-18 to 5.1 in 2019-23. However, the country remains the second-worst performing economy in Asia on this metric. India took some limited steps towards overhauling its outdated array of labour laws (many of which have not be comprehensively revamped in decades) under the previous NDA admini-stration. For example, it moved to allow all industrial establishments to hire workers on fixed-term contracts, previously permissible only in the textile industry. We expect this trend to continue broadly in 2019-23, but progress will be inhibited by opposition from trade unions-including those affiliated with the ruling coalition.
A major reason for the slow progress on labour law reform is the government's lack of a majority in the Rajya Sabha, which means that it depends on the support of opposition parties to get legislation approved. We expect the NDA to obtain a majority in the upper house from 2021, which should speed up the legislation process.
Labour laws will undergo substantial reform in 2019-23
The government has prepared a Code of Industrial Relations, representing the consolidation of over 40 different labour laws under four major codes covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety, health and working conditions. Given strong resistance from opposition parties and trade unions, passage of these changes will not be swift. However, parliament passed the first code, on wages, in July 2019 (although it has not yet become law). This includes clauses that allow the government to set national minimum wage floor rates for various regions and industries. We believe that the other codes are likely to be passed in the period to 2021, with the code on occupational safety likely to be the next one approved. Among other things, the new legislation on industrial relations will significantly curb the power of unions and their ability to call strikes.
Some state governments, particularly in the west and south, will continue to implement labour reforms throughout the forecast period. Rajasthan, for example, has exempted establishments with up to 300 workers from the provision of the Industrial Disputes Act that requires government permission before laying off workers. Meanwhile, Maharashtra has set self-certification systems for business units covered under 16 different acts, with a view to reducing the interference of government officials and expediting the process of certification. Although the central government is harmonising and simplifying many labour regulations at national level, the states will still retain considerable autonomy to advance their own reforms in this field.
The government's budget for 2019/20 contained notable promises to improve education policy, in order to provide the workforce with the skills necessary to supply talent to emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, virtual reality, the internet of things and Big Data. We do not believe that these commitments will result in much change on the ground in 2019-23, and the shortage of workers with suitable skills will remain a problem for many industries.

Significant gaps between demand supply in infrastructure will persist
The score for infrastructure improves from 3 in 2014-18 to 4.3 in 2019-23. This is driven by higher scores for road density, railways, distribution networks and air transport. However, India remains a laggard in this category, ranked 72nd out of the 82 countries in 2019-23, owing to weak scores for internet speed and the quality of port infrastructure, as well as the relatively high cost of good-quality office space. Infrastructure improvements and expansion remain key priorities for the NDA government. We expect the bulk of public investment to be diverted to transport, energy and urban-improvement projects. However, the pace of progress on projects that are already under way will remain constrained by weak government effectiveness and delays in regulatory clearances (particularly environmental approvals).
Progress on urban civic infrastructure projects, such as water supply, will be hindered by inadequate private-sector involvement. The limited returns on investment in these sectors mean that official efforts to draw in more private-sector participation will struggle. The private sector will instead focus on areas that promise faster returns, like airport construction, and there will be significant progress in these areas in 2019-23. However, demand for infrastructure will continue to exceed supply by a significant margin in the forecast period, placing stress on already scarce resources.
Flagship infrastructure projects are likely to miss completion targets
Two publicly funded connectivity projects, Bharatmala (road construction) and Sagarmala (port construction), will continue to be prioritised throughout the forecast period. The first phase of Bharatmala is aimed at connecting 550 of the country's districts through the national highways network, from only 300 in 2017. The government plans to build a total of 24,800 km of roads by 2022. However, progress on this project will be hindered by limited funds, and it is likely to miss its targets.
The quality and breadth of railway services will remain a challenge in 2019-23. India has one of the largest rail networks in the world, but the quality of the network is inadequate, with frequent accidents and poor speeds that restrain efficiency. A lack of capital investment in the sector constrains the expansion of capacity. Despite piecemeal efforts, the overall quality of the rail network will remain poor in comparison with other countries with large rail networks, such as China and the US. However, rapid-transit projects, including a "bullet train" connecting Ahmedabad with Mumbai, and several ongoing urban mass rapid transit projects, will make significant progress during the forecast period.
Government officials have announced plans for new airports in 70 locations, as well as 30 expansion projects for existing airports, over 15 years from 2018. These investments will be sorely needed. A report in 2018 by a local newspaper, the Hindustan Times, cited a study by the Civil Aviation Ministry indicating that Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur, Pune, Ahmadabad, Rajkot, Patna, Kolkata and Bangalore were among the cities that would need a second airport by 2035.

India scores respectably on technological readiness. However, its score in the category does not improve in 2019-23, which results in its global ranking falling from 42nd to 48th. The country boasts a relatively advanced research-and-development (R&D) infrastructure, partly owing to the fact that the education system has historically been skewed towards higher educational outcomes. This has facilitated the development of relatively research-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals and technology. As a result, India files an unusually high number of patents, and R&D spending is quite high as a share of GDP. India has also been an enthusiastic adopter of e-government systems, seeking to improve the effectiveness of public service delivery and reduce corruption. Its Aadhar biometric identity cards are helping to enable this process. Nevertheless, high levels of poverty mean that mobile and internet penetration rates in India are still low compared with global and Asian norms.
Internet speeds will remain slow by global standards
India lags behind in terms of mobile internet speeds. In a report published in May 2019, a market intelligence company, OpenSignal, ranked India 74th out of 87 countries (although 4G services were widely available). In 2018 the Telecom Commission, a government agency, approved the new National Digital Communication Policy, the objectives of which include providing minimum download speeds of 50 Mbps and enabling 10-Gbps connectivity to all rural administrations by 2022. The policy also aims to generate 4m jobs in digital communication and to increase the sector's contribution to India's GDP from around 6% at present to 8% by 2022. However, acquiring spectrum licences and laying the requisite fibre network will create obstacles, and the government is likely to fall short of its targets.
E-commerce has become the focal point of India's digital revolution, owing to factors such as FDI-friendly regulation, a growing middle class, the availability of relatively cheap mobile connections and skilled labour to develop indigenous technology platforms. A report published in 2018 by PWC, a global professional services provider, argued that spending on e-commerce would rise from US$36bn in 2017 to US$105bn in 2022, led by online retail, travel and hotels. The company also expects to see particularly rapid growth in spending on online financial services. At the lower end of the pricing spectrum, the development of online commerce will be facilitated by the government's Bharat-Net programme, which seeks to provide internet connectivity to every village in the country.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks. We believe that this sum, if delivered in full, would be sufficient to substantially address balance-sheet problems, but implementation may be a challenge.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a bone of contention with countries such as the US in 2019-23. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Once the NDA has control of the Rajya Sabha, from mid-2021, this will ease the challenges in the legislative process. However we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects are likely to face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.

Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators

Budget balance -3.5 -3.5 -3.4 -3.0 -3.1 -3.6
Government debt 48.3 47.0 46.5 46.3 45.8 45.3
The new government's first budget, for the remainder of fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) was less populist than we had initially anticipated. More firms will be able to enjoy a concessional 25% rate of corporation tax after revenue thresholds were raised, while tax rates for high-earning individuals were increased. The budget also continued the government's efforts to simplify and digitise the tax system, including the regime for the goods and services tax (GST). Over the forecast period, efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will continue; India's tax/GDP ratio remains low by regional and OECD standards. More worryingly, there were signs in the budget that the government was seeking to use the customs regime to encourage import substitution-an approach that has failed badly in India in the past.
Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government over the forecast period. It will seek to increase the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. This will keep the fiscal deficit wide throughout the forecast period, averaging the equivalent of 3.3% of GDP a year in 2019/20-2022/23.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits of some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will keep inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework in the next five years. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range and close to a target of 4% throughout 2019-23. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is likely to more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. The most recent policy interest rate cut in August, of 35 basis points, took the repurchase (repo) rate to a nine-year low of 5.4%. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will hold rates until 2021. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023, the RBI will adopt a neutral stance.

High-frequency data suggest that the economy is decelerating. We believe that household demand has been adversely affected by rising unemployment and slowing wage growth, particularly in rural areas. Meanwhile, business sentiment remains subdued. Although the 2019 general election results ensure medium-term political stability, we do not expect a dramatic acceleration in private investment. This is because businesses remain sceptical about broader economic prospects. Nevertheless, the govern-ment's focus on infrastructure improvement and domestic market oppor-tunities will provide some support for gross fixed capital formation over the next five years.
We do not expect a significant improvement in job creation in the forecast period, as government efforts will focus on small-scale industries and are unlikely to have the desired effect in boosting employment. The focus on smaller firms will crowd out the larger-scale enterprises that would be more productive and effective job-creators in the longer term. This effect will be aggravated by outdated labour laws that deter companies from scaling up. Economic growth will therefore remain below potential throughout the forecast period, despite stable inflation. Meanwhile, we do not envisage a substantial narrowing in the budget deficit over the forecast period, and so government spending on goods and services will remain supportive of growth. Imports of goods and services will grow more quickly in real terms than export volumes, and net exports will therefore exert a drag on economic expansion. Real GDP growth will average 6.6% a year in 2019/20-2023/24, keeping India among the fastest-growing major economies throughout the forecast period.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector will remain a drag on the economy. Public investment in the sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
As the economy moves up the value chain and productivity improves, the share of agriculture in total output will continue to decline gradually; we expect it to fall from 16.1% in 2018/19 to 13.7% by 2023/24. The primary sector will remain important, as it will continue to employ around half of the population. As employment opportunities in the secondary and tertiary sectors open up, however, there will be a gradual shift in employment away from agriculture. Reforms to bolster supply-chain efficiency will support the sector's outlook in 2019-23. However, farm-to-wholesale procurement is still dominated by individual middlemen and local traders, with laws inhibiting the entry of companies in many states. This will continue to create inefficiencies in the procurement process.
There is significant scope for investment to enhance the sector's productivity, as close to half of all cultivable land remains dependent on annual monsoon rainfalls, rendering the sector vulnerable to poor or unevenly distributed rains. The government has recognised the sector's vulnerability to monsoon rainfalls and increased funding for irrigation schemes and crop insurance. As agriculture faces growing risks related to the availability of water, the success of these efforts will prove crucial to ensuring long-term sustainability. However, capital investment into the sector remains inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of populist short-term subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers. We forecast that the agriculture sector will grow by 3.2% a year on average in the forecast period.
Land-acquisition challenges will inhibit faster growth in the industrial sector
The industrial sector will expand at a robust pace as the business environment improves and the country's strong economic growth outlook attracts invest-ment, expanding capacity. We expect the sector to grow by an average rate of 6.5% a year in the forecast period. However, the share of industry in total GDP will remain relatively stable, falling slightly from 29.6% in 2018/19 to 29.4% in 2023/24. Manufacturing will continue to be particularly concentrated in a few sectors, such as the automotive industry, and in a few geographic locations. This will render it vulnerable to sectoral swings, such as the downturn in demand for cars being witnessed so far in 2019.
Government efforts to lift manufacturing employment and output-such as the "Make in India" initiative (which targets 100m additional jobs in manufacturing and a rise in its share of GDP to 25% by 2022) and the administration's special-economic-zone strategy, which is intended to develop manufacturing hubs throughout the country-are highly ambitious but will miss their targets. In the absence of greater liberalisation of laws governing land acquisition, industrial expansion will lag behind potential, which will weigh on employment opportunities.
Accounting for 46.3% of GDP in 2018/19, the services sector will continue to be the main engine of economic expansion. The sector has shown itself to be resilient and efficient, and not entirely dependent on buoyancy in external markets. The sector's expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as telecommunications, as well as by services in numerous high-potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, retailing, hospitality and education. Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services will remain a major source of export revenue, even as growth slows in the face of increased competition from countries such as the Philippines. Services will form a key sector of the economy in the forecast period, expand-ing by 7.5% a year on average, and its share of GDP will rise to 49.5% by 2023/24.

Unit labour costs (US$) -1.7 1.4 6.4 1.7 3.4 4.8
Prices of food and oil will remain the key factors driving inflationary pressures in 2019-23. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability. Food price inflation has been weak in recent months, but we anticipate that it will accelerate in the second half of 2019, as crop yields during the summer harvest are expected to be lower than usual. Nevertheless, headline inflation will cool to 3.6% in 2019 on average, from 3.9% in 2018, owing to weaker crude oil prices this year.
Lower crude oil prices will also have a dampening effect on prices in 2020, but this will be offset by a modest pick-up in domestic demand growth, the RBI's accommodative monetary policy and the lagged effects of seasonal climatic factors from 2019. Average annual consumer price inflation will thus accelerate in 2020, to 4.2%. Later in the forecast period, continued strong economic growth will stoke demand-pull inflation, while a weakening of the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will exert an upward influence on prices in 2021-23, by pushing up the cost of imports. We expect consumer prices to rise by an annual average of 4% over 2019-23 as a whole.

Although the rupee has weakened sharply in the wake of the government's decision on Jammu and Kashmir, we regard this as a short-term effect. We continue to expect that a narrowing current-account deficit and improved investor sentiment will ease downward pressure on the rupee in 2019 as a whole, with the currency's exchange rate set to end the year stronger against the US dollar than it was at the end of 2018. However, in annual average terms the rupee will still depreciate in 2019, albeit mildly, weakening to Rs69.8:US$1, from Rs68.4:US$1 last year.
The rupee will appreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, supported by interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) against a backdrop of an economic slowdown in the US. In 2021-23 the rupee will return to a gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable over 2019-23 as a whole, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.

India's dependence on imported crude oil for its energy needs will continue to keep merchandise imports high. Imports will also be lifted by growing demand for foreign consumer products and construction-related machinery. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will continue to be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly the business process outsourcing and information technology segments. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP annually in 2019-23.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2019-23, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$68bn by 2023, from US$42.1bn in 2018. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in 2018, owing to jittery investor confidence amid a currency crisis in emerging markets such as Turkey, which stoked fears of contagion, as well as rising US interest rates. We expect this trend to reverse in 2019-23 as investor confidence is gradually restored.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India
Stocks and flows
India's large market and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have been strong in recent years, and in 2018 the country received US$42.1bn in FDI inflows. This compares favourably with an average of US$17.8bn in 2005-07, before the outbreak of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$386.2bn in 2018, markedly higher than in 2010, when it stood at US$205.6bn. The 2018 figure was also higher than the corresponding stock in Indonesia (US$268.5bn) but significantly lower than in China (US$1.7trn) and Brazil (US$762bn).
Origin and distribution
According to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the largest source of FDI is Mauritius, which accounted for 31% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2019. Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons. Singapore was the second most important foreign investor in the same period, accounting for 21.3% of cumulative inflows, followed by Japan (7.3%), the Netherlands (6.9%), the US (6.2%) and the UK (5.9%). The most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$74.1bn between April 2000 and March 2019 and accounted for 18% of cumulative inflows, according to the DIPP. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient, attracting US$37.2bn over the same period. The country's leading financial centre, Mumbai, is the largest recipient of FDI, and garnered 30% of total FDI between April 2000 and March 2019. This was followed by the capital, New Delhi, and neighbouring areas, which received 20% of total FDI in the same period.
Determinants
India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since coming into office the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, civil aviation and single-brand retailing. It has also done away with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, an agency that was tasked with considering and recommending FDI on a case-by-case basis. This onus now falls on individual ministries, and the administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed and legal uncertainties often persist, impeding the inflow of investment and hampering the ease of conducting business in India for foreigners.
Impact
FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Call centres and other forms of back-office administration have become important industries, but India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, telecommunications and power sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The online retail sector is likely to be similarly transformed, with US-based Amazon and Walmart (through its Flipkart subsidiary) now having a significant presence in the e-commerce sector. However, in offline retail, a significant relaxation of regulations for multi-brand retailers is unlikely to occur over 2019-23.
Potential
Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI, but the potential for even stronger inflows is reduced by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors are likely to be the key areas for FDI in 2019-23. Biotechnology and vehicle manufacturing (including parts) could also attract significant interest over the next five years, although the downturn in car sales in 2019 will make some producers wary of entering in the short term.

The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will grow by 1% a year on average in 2019-23, down from 1.1% in 2014-18. This slight slowdown is linked to an improvement in living standards, urbanisation and generally improving economic conditions for women, which are resulting in women having fewer babies. According to data from the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog, the government's policy think-tank), the total fertility rate fell to 2.3 children per woman in 2015, from 3.2 in 2000. India is likely to reach the replacement level of fertility-2.1 children per woman-within our forecast period. In the coastal states, the fertility rate is already below the replacement rate. However, poor and populous states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will continue to see strong population growth, adding to social tensions.
High levels of gender disparity will increase the risk of social unrest
By 2023 men will outnumber women by almost 50m. According to the latest census, conducted in 2011, there were just 919 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of six, marking a decline from the previous census in 2001, which showed that there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys. More recent research from the National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, shows that a skewed sex ratio exists across almost the entire country (the gender disparity is more pronounced in urban regions than rural areas). Historically, countries with wide gender disparities have tended to suffer from higher levels of social disorder, and we do not expect India to be an exception to this trend. Social tensions will be particularly notable in urban areas, fuelled partly by the inability of many men to find suitable employment opportunities.
Caste factors will be another important source of social strains within India in 2019-23. The Hindu-nationalist populism promoted by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government will have complex effects. On one hand, it is likely to re-energise Hinduism, which could lead to renewed emphasis on traditional caste roles. On the other hand, the government appears supportive of policies that favour caste-based "reservations" (quotas) for jobs and public services such as education, which may help those in low-status castes. Caste groups (including higher-status castes) that do not currently enjoy special job quota allocations, especially in public-sector jobs, will push for them in the next five years. Regardless of the government's policy approach, the ongoing trend for workers to move from more conservative rural regions to more cosmopolitan urban areas will serve to slowly weaken the roots of the caste system.
The agricultural sector will continue to employ the bulk of the labour force
Growth in the working-age population will remain relatively strong, at 1.2% a year on average in 2019-23. However, unlocking the economic benefits from population growth will prove challenging. In the 1990s and 2000s China was able to transfer workers from agriculture to more productive work in the cities, thereby boosting economic growth and exports. However, India's manufac-turing sector has failed to take off in a similar manner. Although it is expected to post strong growth in the next five years, this is still unlikely to be sufficient to provide jobs for all the expected migrants from rural areas, particularly because of advancing levels of automation. Services will also provide new jobs, but many of these will not be of a suitable level for low-skill workers. Agriculture will thus remain the mainstay of employment.
A key challenge for the country's long-term development is the poor state of primary-level education. While enrolment rates have risen in recent decades, educational outcomes remain abysmal, especially in the public sector. This reflects multiple factors, including underqualified and undisciplined teachers, the impact of caste within the education system, poor health among students and bad infrastructure within schools. The situation has resulted in strong demand even among poor households for private education, including online courses.
Weaknesses in other parts of the education system will also come to the fore as more students seek secondary and tertiary education. Few universities operate at world-class levels, and the vast majority of graduates appear unequipped for the demands of employers-even in sectors such as engineering, which are crucial for long-term growth. The growing politicisation of the tertiary education sector and the authorities' lack of clear focus on improving educational standards mean that Indian universities will broadly continue to under-perform. A few clusters of excellence will, however, gradually emerge.

The middle class will continue to grow throughout the forecast period
Even though we have downgraded India's medium-term growth outlook in the last year, we still expect the country to have one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Rising income levels over 2019-23 mean that India's huge population will become an increasingly important market for consumer goods. Household consumption expenditure will rise from US$1.6trn in 2018 to US$2.5trn by 2023. Despite rapid economic growth, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain low at just US$3,008 in 2023, compared with US$12,554 in China and US$10,845 in Brazil in the same year. This will limit the bulk of consumer spending to food and basic necessities. This low average nevertheless masks the presence of a growing number of middle-class households, which offers considerable potential for purveyors of higher-value products and services. The rapid growth in personal incomes, combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies. Significant regional economic disparities exist, and the levels of opportunity for retail businesses will vary greatly across the country in the forecast period.
Growth in the e-commerce segment will be robust
Opportunities for e-commerce will grow rapidly in urban areas, owing to their increasingly well-educated populations and growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Foreign firms are positioning to take advantage of this trend. In 2018 Wal-Mart (US) acquired a controlling stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company, and it competes aggressively with the local unit of Amazon (also of the US). As India continues on a solid growth path in 2019-23, and as levels of internet penetration deepen, the share of e-commerce in its consumer market will rise, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms. Nevertheless, regulation will provide some obstacles to their competitive capacity. In December 2018 the government introduced measures preventing e-commerce platforms from entering exclusive deals with suppliers to sell products at deep discounts, as well as limiting the amount of inventory a vendor could sell to a single platform. Foreign firms see these measures as discriminatory, and the government will come under pressure to revise them in 2019-23.
As Indian consumers become more aware of international brands, imports of electronics and consumer goods will rise. Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address affordability by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice serves as a way to develop brand loyalty among new consumers.

As in most developing countries, food constitutes by far the largest category of consumer expenditure. Indeed, spending on food as a percentage of income will remain relatively stable over 2019-23, as households increase the share of more expensive foods, like meat, in their diets. Spending on leisure and education, as well as health, will also pick up. The relatively poor state of government-provided services means that as Indians become richer, they will spend an increasing amount on private healthcare and education. Growth in the leisure sector will be fuelled by the rapidly expanding middle class, which will spend more on entertainment and holidays.
Local factors will continue to shape consumer preferences
Several non-income-related factors must be weighed carefully when assessing prospects in the Indian market. First, purchasing power is as location-specific as it is income-sensitive, and prices can vary to a considerable degree even from city to city, let alone between urban and rural areas. Second, cultural factors matter to a significant degree. Third, Indian consumers, including those who are moving up the income scale, are highly price-conscious. Fourth, it is important to note that there is hardly a single characteristic that applies across the entire country. India is a widely varying collection of markets, necessitating a strategic approach that takes regional differences into account. Finally, the steady expansion of consumer finance and the growth of a credit-card culture will increase the number of consumers in the forecast period.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state-directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reform and market liberalisation. Since then, India has recorded rapid rates of expansion, with annual real GDP growth averaging 6.6% in fiscal years 1991/92-2018/19 (April-March). However, India's share of world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains low, at around 3.3% in 2018, compared with its 17.9% share of the world's population. This highlights the fact that there is still significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for widespread poverty. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries, such as information technology (IT), is vast. Corruption is still endemic in local authorities, despite the fact that attempts to reduce graft have made progress at the higher levels of government under the Bharatiya Janata Party (which has led the ruling coalition since 2014). India's courts have long suffered from crippling levels of understaffing, and a case backlog has built up over decades. However, the judiciary is independent from the government.
The skills mismatch will persist as education and training remain poor
Demographic trends: Continued growth of the working-age population over 2019-50 will support India's economic expansion. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will not find employment in productive formal-sector jobs. A mismatch between the skills offered by the country's workers and the demands of employers will persist for at least the next two decades, as the quality of teaching provided by the country's public education and vocational training systems remains poor. The rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will meanwhile dampen employment gains, even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of global manufacturing. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove immensely difficult in this environment. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the vast majority of the workforce to be absorbed by low-productivity occupations in the urban services sector in 2019-50. Still, opportunities for better-educated Indians will proliferate amid rapid growth in manufacturing and high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharma-ceuticals.
Migration from poorer states could cause a spike in social tensions
Divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. In the absence of major governance improvements, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be a source of internal migrants, putting pressure on scarce resources in more prosperous and economically dynamic cities such as the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai. There is strong divergence in fertility rates between states, with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh recording high total fertility rates (TFR) of 3.2 and 3 respectively in 2017; the more prosperous state of Kerala had a TFR of 1.7 in the same year. This will continue in the long run, and the population of Uttar Pradesh alone could surpass 400m by the middle of the century. Significant levels of internal migration will be a source of political and social tensions. Meanwhile, some workers will look abroad, to areas such as the Gulf region, for economic opportunities. Inflows from their remittances over the next few decades will be an important driver of economic activity in some states.
The unequal gender distribution of India's population will remain a threat to social stability over the outlook period. According to the latest census, conducted in 2011, for every 1,000 boys under the age of six there were only 919 girls, marking a decline from the previous census in 2001, which showed that there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys. Child mortality rates are higher for girls than boys, and female foeticide is practised. As this trend continues (and there is no evidence to suggest that it will not), a major imbalance between the numbers of men and women will undermine social stability.
India's diplomatic, economic and military power will increase
External conditions: As its economy expands in size, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and to cultivate ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival. We expect India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences. Temporary bouts of high tension are likely. However, the growth differential between India and Pakistan will remain high, suggesting that India's military advantage over its rival will increase. Over time, this should deter Pakistan from initiating conflict. China's influential role in Pakistan and its competition for influence in South Asia with India will weigh on bilateral relations between the world's two most populous nations. Shared strategic and economic interests will bind India more closely with Japan and the US. Still, even as it becomes a major diplo-matic power, India will remain hesitant to align itself fully with the West. This is partially related to India's complex relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment. Averting the possibility of closer Russia-Pakistan ties will remain a foreign policy imperative. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement in these regions over the period to 2050.
Institutions and policy trends: Although political power will be centralised under the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, we expect this trend to reverse once he leaves office. Differences in policy approach at state level will thus have a significant impact on economic outcomes. Reform-minded states will see growth accelerate, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to reduce economic disparities. The fight over control of the central government will fuel political instability as regional parties increase in influence. Despite state-level differences, India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will generally remain impartial (if slow) and the constitution will continue to be respected. India's integration into regional and global value chains will nonetheless be constrained by a lingering tendency towards protectionism. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft, particularly at local level.
Services will continue to dominate the economy in the longer term
Long-term performance: We forecast that India's real GDP growth will average 4.9% a year in 2019-50. The country's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment and help to enhance the performance of the economy. Improvements in agricultural procurement practices and greater supply-chain efficiency will make rural India more resilient to weather shocks. A stronger agricultural sector will temper the movement of Indians from rural to urban areas, and the urban population will overtake its rural counterpart only by the middle of this century. However, the shift of the workforce from rural labour into more productive urban jobs will remain the main driver of India's economic expansion in the period to 2050. One major concern over the country's long-term economic performance is the extent to which the government can manage this transition. Upgrading the quality of public education will be crucial if the government is to achieve this successfully. Without this, India is unlikely to be able to develop either the low-skilled manufacturing sector that will be crucial to its medium-term growth prospects or the higher-value-added sectors that will be necessary to sustain its growth momentum in the longer term.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
India will be highly vulnerable to climate change, and adverse changes in monsoon patterns could severely affect its agricultural sector, which remains highly rain-dependent. More generally, water scarcity will become a challenge, as has been highlighted in 2019 by a major crisis in Chennai. The government has taken steps to manage the effects of climate change, and more attention will be given to this issue. However, given the scale of environmental challenges India faces, policy measures are unlikely to reduce the country's vulnerability to climate change significantly.
India is already the world's third-largest consumer of energy, and demand will continue to grow over the forecast period. In order to add to its energy capacity while also meeting its commitments under the Paris climate accord, the government is making efforts to diversify from conventional sources of energy, such as coal-fired thermal power stations. India is one of the most active members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which promotes the transition to solar energy, and the ISA has established its headquarters in Gurgaon. The ISA aims to raise US$1trn in financing and to install 1,000 GW of solar capacity across its 121 member states by 2030. India is likely to utilise the platform provided by the ISA to leverage funding and assistance from developed nations and multilateral agencies to develop its own solar sector.
The country has also been making strides in developing wind energy. The National Institute for Wind Energy has estimated India's wind-power potential at 302 GW, with the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan having the greatest potential. Serious efforts in this regard have started; India's installed capacity in wind energy is now the world's fourth largest. According to the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog, the government's policy think-tank), around 304m people in India lived without electricity in 2017. Consequently, even as renewable sources of energy will make advances, the significant gap between supply and demand in energy will mean that coal-fired thermal power plants remain critical to India's energy mix.
This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Indian economy will be 3.7% smaller in 2050 than it would have been otherwise without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation
India will continue to see an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities in search of better-paying employment. Increasingly, public policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will tilt more towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, anaemic infrastructure and declining sustainability in urban centres. The construction of urban mass-transit systems will increase sharply, along with other urban infrastructure such as sewerage and power grids. Demands for more public housing will also grow louder. However, the enormous scale of these challenges and limited government effectiveness will temper the pace of progress.
The biggest challenge for policymakers will be skilling and training the workforce of rural immigrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agriculture sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry. Meanwhile, emigration to Western countries, particularly the US and Canada, as well as to the prosperous states of the Gulf, such as the UAE, will remain strong. Consequently, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Chile--highlights: Political outlook
Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos coalition won the 2017 presidential election and took office in March 2018. A change to a more proportional electoral system challenged the traditional domination of centre-left and centre-right coalitions; as a result, no coalition currently holds a majority in either house of Congress. This makes policymaking difficult, and means that the legislative agenda will move slowly and be kept broadly centrist, in order to attract the necessary votes. Government effectiveness will remain the best in the region, owing to competent officials and cross-party support for pro-market policies. The country ranks highly in measures of stability and rule of law.

Chile remains in top position in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for Latin America over the forecast period. Its strengths include a long-standing, well-functioning market economy, an open foreign investment regime, and deep and sophisticated capital markets. The country will remain at the forefront of regional and Pacific Rim integration efforts, underpinning an already extensive free-trade framework. Improvements to education and infrastructure-including renewable energy supply during the forecast period-will further underpin the environment for business.

Annual growth will average 3.1% in 2019-23. Although a faster pace of growth than the previous five-year period, it is still tepid compared with Chile's growth rates in the 1990s and during the commodities supercycle. Faster growth stems from a recovery in copper prices and investment, and will be supported by Chile's productive capacity, relatively good and improving infrastructure, and prized political and institutional stability. The current account will remain in deficit, even though the trade surplus is trending upwards, owing to higher debt repayments and profit repatriation by multinational firms, but it will remain manageable. Deficits will be financed through capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI).

At an estimated 18.7m in 2018, Chile's small population is growing, but at a slower rate than those of most of its neighbours. Chile's birth rate has fallen steadily in recent years, from 16.4 per 1,000 people in 2002-07 to 13.9 per 1,000 in 2014-18, and is forecast to slow further, to 13.1 per 1,000 in 2019-23. Chile also has an older demographic profile than most in the region, with those aged 65 and over accounting for more than 10% of the total population, a proportion that is set to rise to 14% by 2023. The labour force is forecast to grow by an average of 1% in the forecast period. Health indicators are broadly comparable with those of other OECD economies.

Ample government infrastructure concessions and expansion in the renewables sector will provide opportunities. Chile's market opportunities are constrained by its small population; however, persistently high wages, combined with political stability and effective economic management, will continue to attract investment. Rising household consumption from 2018-bolstered by high employment, increased real incomes and low inflation-will lift consumer expenditure. High income inequality will gradually recede.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Broad consensus in favour of orthodox monetary and fiscal policies will underpin long-term economic growth, but challenges from new left-wing political parties are a risk. Free-trade agreements within and outside the region will help to attract foreign investment. Average annual GDP growth is forecast to reach 2.8% in 2019-30, moderating to 2.3% in 2031-50. The capital stock will continue to grow and investment will rise to 24% of GDP. However, as growth in the working-age population slows, so will the increase in labour supply, causing economic growth to become more dependent on productivity gains.

Background: In 1988 the military ruler, Augusto Pinochet, lost a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in office. Instead, the centre-left Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia coalition (later Nueva Mayoría-NM) won the December 1989 general election and the next four presidential elections. A realignment of forces helped the centre-right to win the 2010 election. Since then, there has been alternation between governments on the right and left. Michelle Bachelet of the NM, who was first elected president in 2006-10 before being succeeded by Sebastián Piñera (2010-14), was re-elected in the 2013 election. In 2018 Ms Bachelet was succeeded again by Mr Piñera, who took office in March 2018.
Political structure: The political system is presidential, with a bicameral legislature that comprises a 43-seat Senate (the upper house) and a 155-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). The presidential term is four years, and consecutive re-election is not permitted. This structure may be subject to change-possibly towards a more prime-ministerial model-as part of ongoing constitutional reform. The judiciary is independent, but the executive exerts some influence through the nomination of temporary judges and the control of promotions to the Supreme Court. Monetary policy is directed by the autonomous Banco Central de Chile (the central bank). Chile has 15 regions, 54 provinces and 346 municipalities.
Policy issues: The two major coalitions broadly agree on maintaining a liberal-market economy, and an orthodox monetary and fiscal policy framework. However, a new left-wing coalition (the third-largest force in Congress) has demanded more social spending. A new proportional electoral system will see issues-such as regional devolution and a conflict involving the Mapuche indigenous people-rise up the political agenda as politics becomes more fragmented.
Taxation: Corporate income tax is assessed at two stages. Declared profit is subject to a 27% first-category tax (FCIT). When profit is distributed to shareholders or partners, a 35% second-category tax applies, minus a credit for FCIT. Tax rate on dividends and interest payments to non-banks is 35%. Royalties and fees transferred abroad are subject to a 30-35% withholding tax. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at 19%.
Foreign trade: The general import tariff rate is 6%, but the trade-weighted effective average rate is below 2%, owing to preferences granted through trade accords. Exports in 2018 were worth US$75.5bn; imports stood at US$70.8bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos (CV) coalition, who served as president in 2010-14, won the December 2017 presidential run-off and took office for a new four-year term on March 11th 2018. CV is chiefly composed of the conservative Unión Demócrata Independiente, and the centre-right Renovación Nacional (Mr Piñera's party), but also includes the smaller Evolución Política (Evópoli). No party holds a majority in either the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) or the Senate (the upper house), but CV holds the largest number of seats in both chambers. The centre-left opposition is comprised of the parties of the former Nueva Mayoría (NM) coalition, which led the previous government (2014-18), and under a previous configuration, the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia, governed Chile from 1990 to 2010. After the last election, the left-wing Frente Amplio emerged as the third-largest force in Congress. The centrist Partido Democracia Cristiana (PDC) broke from NM in April 2018, and currently forms the fourth-largest bloc in the lower house and third-largest in the upper house. Independent parties, which are largely on the centre-left, also have a congressional presence.
CV holds 19 of 43 seats in the upper house and 72 of 155 in the lower house. It will need to rely on votes from other coalitions or dissident members of the opposition to pass legislation. Votes are most likely to come from the PDC, but support will be on an ad hoc basis, as the PDC has ruled out an alliance with CV and declared itself firmly on the left. Nevertheless, the necessity to win opposition support will keep policymaking broadly centrist.

Political outlook: Political stability
The Piñera government lacks an outright legislative majority and faces a difficult task advancing its reform agenda in the context of a fragmented legislature. Mr Piñera reshuffled his cabinet in mid-June, making changes to six ministries, as he seeks economy-boosting reforms. His priorities include modernising the tax and pension systems, and reducing red tape to stoke investment. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects reforms to be piecemeal and modest, as right-leaning policies will be met with stiff resistance from left-leaning parties in Congress. A change in the electoral process for 2017 produced a more proportional political system, ending the traditional dominance of two (centre-left and centre-right) coalitions. As a result, no coalition presently holds a majority in either the lower house or the upper house, weakening political stability and effectiveness.
The opposition parties of the now defunct NM (2013-18) have failed so far to recover from their 2017 electoral defeat, with no clear leadership or consensus among them on how to approach Mr Piñera's government. Left-wing elements have vowed to oppose the administration, while those in the centre have flirted with being more co-operative. However, such support will be ad hoc, with the legislative agenda prone to blocking tactics. Policy differences between Chile's two big coalitions will widen as decades of broad policy consensus becomes diluted. To date, only the government's proposed pension reform shows signs of advancing, having been approved by the lower house. Other reforms on tax, migration, labour and healthcare have stalled in Congress. The stalemate is undermining support for both Mr Piñera and the government, although the president's support in opinion polls has recovered slightly from its low of 28% in May to 32% in June, after the cabinet reshuffle. The risk of political gridlock will also increase from mid-2020 onwards, as municipal and then general electoral considerations re-emerge and as the economy faces headwinds.
Mr Piñera has taken a progressive stance on indigenous rights, including constitutional recognition for the Mapuche, Chile's largest indigenous group, which should gain cross-coalition support. Progress in this area should help to ease a slow-burning conflict in Chile's southern regions. The risk of renewed protests in other areas will persist, especially regarding education and pensions, but we do not expect demonstrations to reach the same intensity as in Mr Piñera's last term in office (2010-14).
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Chile's system of government is considered the most effective and technically adept in Latin America, owing in part to a high degree of political stability and a highly professional bureaucracy. This is unlikely to change substantively in the forecast period, but there are several risks to political effectiveness. Corruption in Chile remains low, even compared with OECD standards-it is the 27th least corrupt country in the world-according to the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index prepared by Transparency International (a global anti-corruption watchdog). Nevertheless, recent years have seen several prominent scandals in both the public and private sectors, which have fuelled public resentment. The scale of wrongdoing, however, is not equivalent to current scandals in other countries in the region, and public prosecutors have so far proved energetic in bringing a number of perpetrators to account.
Since the peaceful transition to democracy in 1990, successive administrations have operated with a broad consensus around maintaining the open and liberal economic model instituted by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-90), while also strengthening democratic institutions. However, the 2017 election, under new electoral rules, resulted in a more fractured legislature, returning Chile to its pre-dictatorship political landscape of coalitions of the right, left and centre. Although this might slow the legislative process, it will also have the effect of promoting consensus (in order to pass legislation), and will result in broadly centrist policymaking. Political engagement and turnout remain low, posing a challenge to long-term confidence in the system. Efforts to promote regional government and divest power to the regions (Chile is highly centralised) could also increase the quality of government. Given that no coalition holds a majority-a situation that could continue in future governments-dramatic policy shifts are unlikely. Changes to organic constitutional provisions require a four-sevenths majority in both houses, while passing bills to reinterpret or modify the constitution require a three-fifths and two-thirds majority respectively.
A civil-service reform in 2003 helped to increase meritocracy by reducing the number of political appointees at the head of government agencies by over 80%, and by making civil servants accountable to an independent directorate. Official transparency and efficiency has also been fostered by the centralisation of the procurement tenders of all government departments and public-sector agencies into a single online platform.
Chile's judicial system is relatively efficient and transparent. The criminal justice system was modernised over a period of six years, following reforms in 1999 that created an office of public prosecutions and established a legal aid service, as well as a new code for penal procedures. Chile ranks highly in most measures of rule of law, protection of private property and overall institutional effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch
Presidential and legislative elections were last held in late 2017. The next elections to take place will be regional and municipal polls in October 2020. Traditionally, the coalition that wins these has gone on to win the presidential and legislative elections the following year; the next presidential and legislative elections will take place in late 2021. Consecutive presidential re-election is prohibited; it is too early to predict who the candidates will be at the next presidential election, but there has been alternation between the left and right since 2010.
Political outlook: International relations
The Piñera government will maintain generally solid relations with the US and with other Latin American countries. It will also seek to strengthen ties with Asia, and particularly with China, as a means of accelerating economic growth and investment in 2019-23. Bilateral trade between China and Chile rose by 24% year on year to US$42.8bn in 2018, and will expand further following the enlargement of the reciprocal list of free-trade items, which came into effect in March 2019. Chile will also seek to improve ties with the region through the Pacific Alliance-an integration project that also includes Peru, Colombia and Mexico-and through Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, the members of which are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). Relations with neighbouring Bolivia will remain complicated, as they are clouded by border disputes. Chile will continue to condemn the undemocratic Venezuelan regime.

Chile's investment climate will remain the most attractive in Latin America in 2019-23 according to The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings (BER), which compare the quality and attractiveness of investment conditions in 82 of the world's largest economies.
A liberal trade and regulatory regime will support the investment climate
Chile ranks first in the region and 16th globally in the 2019-23 forecast period, boosted by its long-standing and well-functioning market economy, open investment regime, strong fiscal position, sophisticated capital markets, and large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs). In all of the component areas that make up the BER, Chile either consolidates its position or makes marginal improvements during 2019-23, facilitating a slight improvement in its underlying score and rising four places in the global ranking.
Chile's policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and its macroeconomic environment, are its greatest strengths in terms of the business environment. This reflects the legacy of a long-running commitment to liberalising the foreign investment regime and opening trade.
A combination of a well-qualified labour force (by regional standards), firm rule of law, a large network of FTAs and a regulatory framework that entices foreign investment has cemented Chile's position in both the global and regional rankings. There are several reforms under debate in Congress that, if passed, would improve the operating environment further, relating to pensions, tax and labour laws. Our underlying expectation is that most of these measures will eventually pass, albeit in a diluted form.

Business environment outlook: Chile's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Government focuses on improving the business climate through simplification of tax processes.
2021-23: Cutting of red tape with investor-friendly measures is possible.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Investment regime remains among the world's most liberal. Investment promotion agency maintains investor-friendly policies, focusing on areas in which Chile has a competitive advantage, seeking to move beyond natural resources.
2021-23: Chile's network of bilateral double-taxation and investment protection accords widens further.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Narrow import-tariff dispersion (0-6%) and free capital flows owing to multiple free-trade agreements.
2021-23: Export development remains a policy priority, and government moves to diversify trade away from its dependence on the US and China.
Taxes
2019-20: Corporate tax structure simplified to boost investment, but tax cuts unlikely. Maximum personal rate lowered.
2021-23: Simplification of tax code, including new tax-savings mechanisms.
Financing
2019-20: Government-backed loan guarantees available. Domestic long-term interest rates are high, and bank lending practices are conservative. Large firms retain reasonable access to bond markets.
2021-23: Further measures to facilitate financing for small businesses, particularly new ventures.
The labour market
2019-20: Reforms to labour regime implemented, strengthening trade unions and reducing flexibility further.
2021-23: Liberalisation of working arrangements, along with performance-related pay in the public sector.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Generally good telecommunications; technological infrastructure is expanded further. Investment in power generation and highway network continues, but energy sector remains vulnerable to shortages.
2021-23: Upgrading of transport infrastructure through concessions. New energy investment comes on stream-following connection between north and central grids-benefiting the expansion of non-conventional renewable sources.
Technological readiness
2019-20: "Start-Up Chile" programme supported by the government continues to attract small technology firms.
2021-23: Government focuses on upgrading digital infrastructure, including an expansion of rural broadband, and public WiFi hotspots.

Chile's global rank for its macroeconomic environment improves noticeably in the forecast period, lifting it to sixth place in this category (marking one of the strongest areas of the business environment). The country cements its position as the most stable and resilient economy in Latin America. Real GDP growth is forecast to be relatively firm, at just over 3% per year in 2019-23, as inflation-although rising slightly-will remain well within the 2-4% target band set by the Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank). We expect the government to make reasonable progress on its pledge of reducing the fiscal deficit owing to spending restraint and higher average copper prices from 2020, which in turn will facilitate a drop in already low levels of public debt. Fiscal responsibility legislation has been in place since 2006, backed by two sovereign wealth funds that held combined assets of US$25.3bn in June (around 8% of GDP). This will continue to cushion the economy from volatility in copper prices and the risk of natural disasters by allowing it to implement countercyclical fiscal policies.
Fiscal prudence and low levels of debt support macroeconomic stability
Chile's macroeconomic environment will remain supported by a solid institutional framework and a general consensus favouring orthodox fiscal and monetary policies, free markets, and integration in the world economy. The central bank has been independent for three decades, and its autonomy is unlikely to come under threat in the forecast period. The BCCh is complemented by an efficient banking supervisory body, the Superintendencia de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras, which has helped to maintain a modern and well-capitalised banking sector that remains vigorous and has proved resilient to external shocks. The securities and insurance regulator, the Comisión del Mercado Financiero, and the pensions supervisor, the Superintendencia de Pensiones, are also part of the regulatory landscape.

Chile will remain the regional leader in policy toward private enterprise
Decades of consistent market-friendly policy and reforms keep Chile in pole position in Latin America, while the global ranking improves by two places for policy towards private enterprise and competition. Following various privatisation programmes-mostly in the late 1980s under the military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-90)-Chile has only a small number of companies left in state hands (most notably Codelco, the world's largest copper producer). Governments on both the right and left have pursued market-orientated solutions to economic problems. In recent years red tape has been significantly reduced-for instance, since 2013 a company can be created online in a single day and without cost. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report, Chile ranked 56th out of 190 countries.
Following a period of strained relations between the business community and the former president, Michelle Bachelet, the return of Sebastián Piñera to the presidency has been largely welcomed by the private sector, given his economic track record during his first term in office (2010-14), as well as his campaign promise to adopt more pro-market policies, including a simplification of the tax rules, modernisation of the environmental evaluation system to speed up the permitting process and a reduction of red tape. Although a fragmented legislature will slow progress, we expect some improvements on these fronts during Mr Piñera's current four-year term.
In an effort to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, in May 2018 the government launched the Oficina de Grandes Proyectos Sustentables (GPS), which is located in the economy ministry and serves as a one-stop shop for investors. In March 2019 the government estimated that around 220 investment projects have been registered for the 2019-23 period, representing an estimated US$70bn in investment and the potential to create 30,000 new jobs. The government has tasked the ministry with identifying and removing other investment bottlenecks.
The platform "empresa en un día" (company in a day) was launched by the first Piñera government in 2013 to spur entrepreneurship. Since then, over 400,000 companies have been created in Chile. In 2018 over 132,000 new businesses were created-a 12% increase from 2017 and the largest annual registration since the system was introduced. The total number of companies registered in Chile now exceeds one million, of which 95% are small, 4% are medium-sized and 1% are large. According to the national statistics institute, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generate around 65% of all jobs.
The state directly controls a handful of companies and holds stakes in another 22 businesses (as of end-2018) operating under the nominal oversight of the Sistema de Empresas Públicas (Public Enterprise System). State-owned companies are meant to generate value through fiscal transfers from their profits and by pursuing initiatives that improve social welfare but are insufficiently attractive to private-sector investors. They contribute to development targets in areas such as communications, defence, energy and natural resources, geographical integration, and transport. There have been no major sales of government holdings since 2012; given the state's generally minor stakes, there is little scope for further privatisations.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards foreign investment

Chile's underlying score for policy towards foreign investment is its strongest in terms of the business environment. The country is ranked third globally and remains the top-ranked in Latin America (by some margin) during 2019-23. Policy is open and pro-business, based on a constitutionally guaranteed principle of non-discrimination between local and foreign investors. Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have fallen recently, at US$6.1bn in 2018, from US$20bn-30bn in 2011-15, but a solid track record on this front means that the stock of inward FDI per head is high, at US$11,300 in 2018 (compared with just over US$13,000 in the US). The country's natural resources and its long track record of economic and political stability, along with its openness to foreign investment, will keep it among the largest FDI recipients in the region.
Copper will remain a major investment draw
Chile will remain one of the world's top destinations for copper mining investment. The Comisión Nacional del Cobre (Cochilco, the state copper authority) has previously indicated that it believes mining investment will total close to US$66bn in 2018-28, with firms attracted by the country's vast mineral wealth, close proximity to coastal ports and reputation for political and economic stability. A rebound in metal prices (demand for copper and lithium, for example, is expected to increase in the forecast period)-paired with the government's pro-market policies-is likely to push inward FDI moderately higher during 2019-23. We forecast a gradual increase in FDI in the forecast period, at close to US$10bn by 2023.
InvestChile shifts its focus to attract all kinds of investment
Unlike the previous administration, which adopted sector-specific policies to attract foreign investment-focusing on the mining, energy, food and tourism industries-the Piñera government has adopted more of a non-discriminatory, multi-sectoral approach. The economy minister, José Ramón Valente, has said that the government investment promotion agency, InvestChile, will not just focus on attracting FDI or on greenfield projects, but will also promote external investment through the foreign acquisition of local companies to develop local industry, working closely with the recently created GPS office.

Chile has more FTAs than any other country
Chile's trade and foreign-exchange regime will remain broadly open during the forecast period, with the underlying score and rankings remaining unchanged. The country has a low trade-weighted average effective import tariff rate as a result of its large network of FTAs and various economic association agreements. As of 2018 these total 26 agreements and involve more than 64 countries, which account for over 86% of global GDP and more than 64% of the global population. The most important are FTAs signed with the EU (February 2003), the US (January 2004), China (October 2006) and Japan (August 2007). Chile also has FTAs with South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey, the European Free-Trade Association (consisting of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Canada, Central America, Australia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Mexico. Chile is also a member of the dynamic Pacific Alliance free-trade bloc-together with Mexico, Colombia and Peru-and has more limited agreements with India, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei. These FTAs offer Chilean firms a potential market of over 4bn people, as 94% of Chile's trade is conducted on a preferential basis. Furthermore, Chile offers an unusually narrow range of import tariff dispersion, ranging from zero to 6%. The country has no exchange restrictions affecting capital or trade flows, but there are reporting formalities with respect to foreign investment exceeding US$10,000.
The Piñera government will continue to play an active role in seeking to deepen ties with other Latin American countries. In November 2018 Chile signed an FTA with Brazil, just before the former president, Michel Temer, left office. The new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsanaro, is likely to proceed with efforts to ratify the agreement. The Chilean government also began negotiations with Ecuador towards an FTA. An agreement with Uruguay was signed in October 2016 and came into effect at the end of 2018. Chile has also modernised its FTA with Canada to include a new chapter on investments.
Chile will continue to deepen its regional integration with Asia-Pacific economies. In March a modernised FTA between Chile and China came into force, making Chile the first individual country to upgrade its FTA with China. The agreement deepens trade liberalisation in goods and services, and adds chapters on e-commerce and the environment. Building on its commitment to boosting trade with Asia, in November 2018 Chile signed a co-operation agreement with China on the latter's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), along with agreements to streamline customs procedures and update protocols for the bilateral trade of agricultural products. The authorities are also negotiating a deepening of the FTA with South Korea.
With the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) following the decision of the US president, Donald Trump, to pull the US from the deal, Chile and the ten other remaining countries signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in March 2018. Mr Piñera submitted it to Congress in November and it was approved in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) after a lengthy debate in April. We expect the Senate (the upper house) to ratify the bill in a vote in August. We believe that Chile will benefit from greater external demand through increased market access, although this will occur gradually as countries incrementally reduce tariffs.

The government is seeking to simplify the current tax system
Chile's score for tax policy improves slightly in the forecast period, allowing it to rise to 14th place globally in the ranking, with the country remaining best-ranked in the Latin America region. Total taxes remain relatively low by international comparison, but filing procedures are onerous. According to the Doing Business 2019 report, it takes 296 hours a year to prepare, file and pay corporate income tax, value-added or sales tax, and labour taxes, compared with an OECD high-income average of 159 hours. The tax regime underwent major reform in 2014. Although the backbone of the reform was an increase in corporate taxes, it created a dual-taxation system that, for many in the private sector, was too complicated to implement fully. As a result, the government signed into law a "reform to the reform" in February 2016 that left only one system in place, the so-called semi-integrated system, in which companies pay a 27% corporate tax rate, and shareholders also pay income tax, but with businesses permitted to deduct some earnings if these are reinvested. The second mechanism of the original system, which establishes a corporate tax rate of 25% along with a 10% income-tax levy on shareholders, remains an option for family-run and small businesses.
During his 2017 presidential campaign, Mr Piñera promised that he would lower the corporate tax rate from 27% to 25%, the average of its OECD peers. However, Mr Piñera has since backtracked, stating that the government will leave the corporate tax rate at current levels, citing a weaker economy and the need to raise additional revenue to fund social programmes and other fiscal spending. A bill submitted to Congress in August 2018 leaves the corporate tax rate unchanged, but this will then serve as credit against income tax. Instead, Mr Piñera is pursuing efforts to simplify the tax code by fully integrating the corporate and personal tax regime. The bill also created a special "SME clause," with a corporate tax rate of 25%, aimed at benefiting companies with annual sales of up to 50,000 Unidades de Fomento (an inflation-linked accounting unit) equivalent to around US$2m. Congress has not yet passed the reform bill, owing to opposition from the political left, which argues that the measures will boost inequality. We expect the bill to come into effect in 2021.
Concerns that meagre pension benefits will force people into post-retirement poverty have led Chilean workers to demand nationalisation of the system. The president is implacably opposed to this idea but has been seeking to address concerns through a pension reform law submitted to Congress in October 2018. Through the proposed reform, the government wants to introduce a new employer's contribution-equivalent to 4% of wages-and beef up a solidarity component of transfers to the poorest pensioners by raising the basic pension rate. Increased payouts for women and those who voluntarily delay their retirement are also possible. However, lawmakers are pressing for further concessions. In July the government conceded that pension fund management would be opened up to new entrants to increase competition; there has been widespread criticism of Chile's oligopoly of six providers. We expect eventual passage of the reform, although the government is likely to make further concessions in order to win the necessary legislative support.

The financial sector is well developed, with a solid institutional framework
Chile remains the leader in Latin America in terms of securing corporate finance, although its global ranking slips by one place in 2019-23. Its capital market is sophisticated, and has been growing in terms of liquidity and market capitalisation, aided by a solid institutional and legal framework. This has involved rapid adoption of new financial instruments, the appearance of new intermediaries and payment systems, and a continued updating of rules, regulations and methods of official supervision. Despite Chile's small population and comparatively low levels of GDP per head, stockmarket capitalisation is high, at around US$246bn at the end of June. The country's privately run pension funds (AFPs) are by far the main players on the demand side. At the end of June 2019 AFPs were managing a total of US$219bn (up from US$202bn a year earlier), of which around 58% is invested in Chile. Insurance companies operating in the country are also substantial investors.
Chilean companies with solid credit ratings will continue to have good access to long-term finance through credits and leasing, and large companies will retain access to a variety of other options, such as stock and bond issues, as well as a competitive and flexible syndicated loan market for maturities of up to ten years. Blue-chip businesses will have access to long-term funding locally-through bank loans with maturities of up to seven years, or local-bond issues with maturities of up to 30 years-owing to the use of the Unidad de Fomento, which eliminates inflation risk.
Healthy economic fundamentals will continue to allow large corporates to access capital and bond markets. Credit terms for companies in Chile will be heavily influenced by shifts in the global financial environment, with the July 2019 cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank)-and the expectation that further cuts are likely-supporting credit access at reasonable rates. Chilean companies will continue to benefit from some of the lowest yields among Latin American borrowers and, even in the event of liquidity difficulties, firms will be supported by Chile's strong international reserves position.

Chile performs less well in the labour market category. Nevertheless, its score and ranking improve in 2019-23 owing to education reforms, which we anticipate will increase the supply of educated and skilled workers in the forecast period, lifting Chile to 21st place globally (and remaining second in the region). These were initiated under the Bachelet government (2014-18) to address long-running deficiencies in the country's education system, which-although better than that of many neighbouring countries-lags behind that of the developing Asia region and other countries in the OECD (of which Chile is a member). The measures expand access to pre-school, university and technical education. Over the coming years, Chile will see 15 new career and technical-education centres opened across the country (one in each region) for vocational education. Businesses have long complained that the labour regime is too rigid. It offers strong worker protections through restrictive regulations and high firing costs (one month's wage per year worked in the company).
Labour reform is in its early stages of implementation
A labour reform approved in 2017 strengthened unions, as it expanded the categories of workers who can join a union, set a floor for negotiations (not permitting the weakening of workers' benefits) and prohibited the replacement of striking workers. It also prohibited the extension of benefits to non-union members. So far, the impact of the reform has been muted (only 9% of workers belong to a union, although the level is higher in the mining sector).
The government plans to introduce proposals to Congress to address outstanding issues that hamper the labour market. In a three-pronged approach, the first is a proposal to reform the national training and employment system. The goal is free tuition for the majority of students in vocational and technical centres, contingent on economic growth and the state of the public finances. The second prong relates to changes to make Chile's statutory working arrangements more flexible; these proposals were submitted to Congress in May 2019. The third prong, which has yet to be presented to Congress, will deal with modifying collective bargaining and unionisation regulations. Similar to other reform proposals, we expect slow progress on the back of congressional opposition, with eventual passage in a watered-down form.

Chile retains first place in the regional ranking for infrastructure in the forecast period and climbs to 26th in the global ranking. The country's telecommunications and technological infrastructure is modern, particularly by regional standards, as the regulatory system for telecoms encourages competition and the early adoption of new technologies. The transport infrastructure is resilient and mostly withstands regular seismic events and other natural disasters. A series of natural disasters have impacted the country since 2010, including: an earthquake and a tsunami in 2010 in the centre-south region; earthquakes, tsunamis and floods in the north in 2014-15; the Calbuco volcano eruption of 2015; and wildfires in the centre-south in 2017. Virtually all damaged infrastructure has since been restored.
Significant funding will continue to be channelled into transport infrastructure. A new underground railway line in the capital, Santiago, opened in November 2017. The government is planning to complete three new lines (numbered 7, 8 and 9), as well as extending three existing lines, by 2026. This would increase Santiago's urban and suburban rail network-which is already one of the most extensive metro systems in Latin America-from 160 km to 296 km. Additional transport funding will be allocated to the two largest metropolitan areas outside the capital, Gran Valparaíso and Gran Concepción, aimed at alleviating some of the congestion that these areas have been experiencing. Chiloé Island will be connected to the mainland through a 2.8-km bridge within the forecast period.
New infrastructure plan aims to accelerate progress
Chile's robust infrastructure is largely attributable to a successful concession system that was launched in the 1990s. Since the late 2000s, however, the number of new infrastructure investment projects has waned as the original group of projects reached completion. Mr Piñera aims to breathe new life into infrastructure, unveiling an ambitious US$20bn programme in July that will cover the period to 2023. The new investment plan aims to secure US$14.4bn of private capital for investment in concessions, with about 50% of the total being spent on roads. The remainder will go on airports, hospitals, dams, water supply and drainage. To kick-start the programme, the government has announced that it has earmarked almost US$1.4bn of public money to fast-track investment in 2019-20. Almost half of this will be used to accelerate the implementation of complementary improvements to existing concession contracts. In addition, the plan includes US$388m for purely state-funded investment projects. These funds will largely be allocated to hospital projects currently under construction, as well as for improvements to roads, ports, airports, dams, irrigation and rural water systems.
The completion of a key transmission line will reduce costs further
Although energy infrastructure has been seen as the weakest part of Chile's infrastructure matrix, this has changed since Ms Bachelet's second term, with the implementation of a long-term strategy that extends beyond our forecast period (Energía 2050). Other improvements include a decline in the price of renewable energy-which helped to spur an increase in clean energy sources-and the connection between the north and central energy grids. These efforts have helped to contain the price of energy, which for years was a major hindrance to invest-ment.
The completion of a transmission line connecting the main north and central-south electricity grids will boost output from the growing non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) sector, as the central-south is where most consumers are situated. NCRE projects already account for 18% of the country's energy supply, and are likely to meet a target of 20% of generation in 2020-five years ahead of schedule.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-orientated the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Chile's score for technological readiness is the highest in the region and 29th in the global ranking, supported by strong internet usage and efforts by successive governments to improve technological and innovative capacity. Nevertheless, investment in research and development (R&D) is low. According to latest OECD data, R&D investment in Chile was 0.4% of GDP in 2016, compared with an OECD average of 2.5%. Following four years of decline, investment in the telecoms sector rose by 9.7% in 2017 and by 6.2% in 2018, according to the Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones (Subtel, the telecoms regulator). Internet usage is high. As of March 2019 mobile 4G internet access stood at 82%, up from 66% a year earlier. Mobile subscriptions are also high, with 135 subscribers per 100 inhabitants at end-March, up from 126 per 100 a year earlier.
The local retail sector has made important efforts to strengthen its e-commerce strategy. According to the Cámara de Comercio de Santiago, the chamber of commerce of Santiago, e-commerce growth has averaged around 30% in recent years, with triple-digit growth in sales from sites such as Amazon (US) and AliExpress (China), and an accelerating move into e-commerce by smaller companies. Estimated growth of 30% in 2018 would take the value of e-commerce to US$5bn, accounting for around 6% of national retail sales.
The new science ministry will lead national science and technology policy
The Ministry of Science, Knowledge, Technology and Innovation was created in December 2018 and oversees all policies, programmes and plans designed to strengthen innovation in science and technology. The ministry has a technical advisory committee, which will periodically review its policies, and an inter-ministerial committee-comprised of the ministers of science, finance, economy and education-tasked with developing a national science policy.
As part of the tax reform bill currently before Congress, the government is proposing to introduce a 10% tax on international digital companies, including online retail giants such as Spotify (Sweden), Netflix (US) and the accommodation site AirBnB (US). However, there is speculation that the new rate may be as high as 19%, in line with the rate of value-added tax (VAT) and also with the OECD suggested rate. The bill does not affect ride-hailing services such as Uber (US) or Cabify (Spain), but a separate bill currently in Congress would require them to establish local subsidiaries.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government led by the president, Sebastián Piñera, has continued with broadly sound macroeconomic policymaking. However, initial expectations of progress on business-friendly reforms under Mr Piñera are wavering, given little concrete progress so far amid pushback from a fragmented Congress. Given a more challenging economic environment for 2019-20-as economic growth in China, the US and Europe weakens-The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that Mr Piñera will make better progress with those aspects of his economic reform agenda that focus on bolstering domestic growth. The reform agenda includes changes to the tax system, but after a year of stalled negotiations in the legislature, the government presented changes in July 2019 that significantly diluted measures. We now expect the advancement of plans to integrate corporate and personal income-tax regimes, but for the impact to be far less business-friendly than the original proposal. Mr Piñera hopes to push the bill through Congress in time for the 2020 budget, although there are still risks to this timeline, given firm opposition from left-of-centre parties.
A pension reform bill is also making its way through Congress, prompted by public pressure for improved pension outcomes. The reform aims to boost the individual pension system by levying a new employer contribution, with the aim of boosting pension outcomes and increasing the amount of transfers to the poorest pensioners. We assume that the pension reform will pass, given its importance as a political issue, but the debate could continue into 2020.
The government aims to address weaknesses in productivity by creating new incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation, and by cutting red tape. To achieve the latter, it will seek to move more processes online and simplify the procedure for establishing small businesses. A major policy challenge is the diversification of the economy away from the dominant copper industry; the government is pushing for more productivity reforms and integration with the global economy. Mr Piñera is also placing great emphasis on infrastructure. His investment plans aim to raise as much as US$20bn-largely from the private sector in exchange for concession contracts-to improve inter-urban transport, water supply and irrigation, and to increase the rural presence of fibre-optic and wireless internet.
Other slated reforms include greater political autonomy for regional governments, allowing them to determine local investment priorities. Reforms to education and healthcare include universal free pre-schooling. In 2018 Congress approved the creation of the new Ministry of Science, Knowledge, Technology and Innovation. It will advise the president on improving science-related policies and increasing investment in research and development, which was just 0.4% of GDP in 2016, compared with an OECD average of 2.5%.
Energy policy will remain high on the agenda, as Chile-a net importer of oil-suffers from high costs and vulnerability to energy shortages; further tax incentives for investors in renew-ables are likely. The government is also likely to continue the controversial use of hydroelectric power in southern Chile. Greater concerns for the environment and better regulation have spurred investment in non-conventional renewables; these types of renewable sources are expected to make up 20% of the energy generation matrix by 2020 (from 17% currently). Mr Piñera has proposed targeting 75% of all energy generation from renewable sources by 2030, and 100% by 2040.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators

Central government revenue 21.9 22.2 22.1 22.6 22.9 23.2
Central government balance -1.7 -1.3 -1.2 -1.0 -0.6 -0.5
Chile has typically been able to run a countercyclical fiscal policy, owing to its prudent policymaking. Nonetheless, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow during the 2019-23 forecast period, reflecting changes to the fiscal rule. The rule sets a structural surplus target based on certain economic assumptions, including projected copper prices and long-term potential GDP growth. The finance minister, Felipe Larraín, wants to improve the framework, as overestimation of economic growth and the long-term copper price in recent years has allowed for higher spending and weakened the public finances. Mr Larraín has announced fiscal austerity measures for central government and state-owned companies. Current plans envisage the elimination of a total US$5bn (around 1.8% of 2018 GDP) from expenditure over four years.
Given the gradual nature of the intended cuts, the government's plan appears credible, and we believe that this will help to narrow the deficit over the forecast period. This process will be further supported by our forecast for higher copper prices in 2020-23. On this basis, we project that the fiscal deficit will gradually narrow from 1.7% of GDP in 2018, to 0.5% by 2023, assuming that fiscal austerity proceeds as expected and copper prices materialise as forecast. Following a dip in copper prices during 2019, our forecast is for the copper price to rise by an annual average of 5.9% in 2020-23. Faster consolidation will be precluded by weaker revenue growth in the face of a slowdown in global GDP in 2019-20, partly a consequence of the US-China trade war.
Public-sector debt will stabilise at 26.2% of GDP in 2020-21 (the same as the average for 2018-19), but will ease thereafter as the primary deficit narrows. Only 19% of central-government debt is external. The government will find it easy to access financing: its external bonds traded at yields of just 132 basis points above US Treasury bills in May-the lowest among Latin America's major economies, and well below the emerging-market average. In the event of a shock, the government could tap reserves held in its economic and social stabilisation fund, which stood at US$14.2bn in June, and a pension reserve fund, valued at US$10.4bn.

Long-term interest rate (av) 4.5 4.4 4.0 4.3 4.6 4.8
In June the Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank) cut the policy rate by 50 basis points, to 2.5%, citing the global economic slowdown and weak domestic economic activity, but recently signalled that it is unlikely to make further moves this year. We expect the policy rate to remain at 2.5%, before an expected cycle of 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2020 to counter the local fallout from a global slowdown. However, this is subject to risks if real GDP growth performs significantly below our current expectations (a forecast 2.6% expansion this year). This would bring the start of rate cuts forward to the year-end. Stimulus would then be gradually removed in 2021-22, as policy switches to a renewed tightening cycle.

Solid economic fundamentals support reasonably firm medium-term growth prospects, but Chile's open economy exposes it to global developments, particularly changes in prices and demand for commodities-minerals (mainly copper) account for around 50% of goods exports, and the country depends heavily on imported oil. Real GDP data from the first quarter show that growth remained flat in seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter terms, and available indicators for the second quarter were also fairly weak; on this basis we have revised our forecast for GDP growth in 2019 down from 3% to 2.6%. The drivers of this weakness have been both external and domestic. Chile appears to be feeling the effects of a slowdown in global trade growth; its export volumes fell substantially in the first quarter. This will have contributed to a contraction in investment, but the latter also reflects business concerns over a lack of progress on Mr Piñera's pro-business agenda so far. Given a lower base effect and stronger US real GDP growth, we expect growth to accelerate to 3.2% in 2020. That said, there are substantial risks to our forecast, particularly in the form of an intensified bilateral US-China trade war, which could weigh on demand in both countries, with knock-on effects for trade partners such as Chile. A recovery in US growth and rising copper prices will support annual average GDP growth of 3.2% in 2021-23. Although such rates represent a significant improvement from 2014-17, growth will be around half the rate posted during the commodities boom.
Private consumption growth will be supported by low real interest rates and falling unemployment. Fiscal austerity will keep government consumption growth muted. Investment will continue to grow, supported by public investment projects and resurgent copper investment as prices recover. External demand for copper, pulp and fruit exports, particularly from Asia, will make the external sector a net contributor to GDP.
On the supply side, the recent slowdown has been broad-based. A recovery in industrial activity experienced in 2018 has since lost momentum and activity, particularly in manufacturing, will remain tepid in 2019-20 as the external environment worsens. Mining output has also underperformed, but higher copper prices in 2020-21 will put a floor under the downtrend. Construction activity will be supported by investment in commercial projects and public works. Growth in services will be reasonable, aided by Chile's advanced retail, shipping and transport sectors, a growing tourism sector, and the country's role as a regional hub for business and financial services. Barring weather-related shocks, growth in agriculture will remain strong in 2019-23, supported by growing Asian demand for Chilean fresh fruit.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Mining will remain among the largest sectors of the economy over the forecast period. With around 170m tonnes in proven high-grade copper reserves (22% of the world's total in 2018)-which are advantageously situated close to the sea- Chile has been the favourite global destination for copper mining investment over the past two decades. This has made it by far the world's largest copper producer, with output of 5.8m tonnes in 2018, around 28% of the global total. Although copper prices are projected to be lower than in the 2006-13 boom years, the country will remain a competitive mining investment destination because of its favourable geological conditions, as well as its political and economic stability. The market is divided between Codelco, the state copper firm, and private mining companies, with private firms accounting for two-thirds of output. Codelco was nationalised in 1971 and is the largest copper-exporting company in the world. By law, the company is required to hand over all of its profits to the state. Major multinational mining companies with a presence in Chile include BHP Billiton (Australia), Rio Tinto (UK-Australia), Xstrata (Switzerland), Anglo-American (UK), Freeport McMoRan (US) and Grupo México (Mexico). There are also numerous local private companies, such as Antofagasta.
Output has weakened in recent years, mainly reflecting the decline of copper prices and ore grades. Output fell in 2016, and again in 2017 owing to a 43-day strike at Escondida, the country's largest mine, as well as flooding in several northern mines. Growth returned in 2018, as prices and investment recovered. Expected levels of investment should bring total Chilean production above the 6m-tonne mark by 2020, with further gains thereafter.
Declining ore grades have forced mines to invest heavily in order to maintain output and extend the working life of mines. Codelco's output will decline in 2020-21 as the transition to exploit deeper ore reserves temporarily harms production. Codelco estimates that it will need to spend around US$40bn over the next decade to extend the life of its ageing mines and explore for new ore reserves, and it is also exploring outside Chile. In order to support massive investment in Codelco, the government has moved to eliminate the Ley Reservada del Cobre (copper reserve law), under which Codelco hands over 10% of its gross export sales for the acquisition of weaponry and munitions by the military. Transfers to fund military purchases were required irrespective of the copper price and the impact on Codelco's finances, which has undermined its capacity to invest and the company's debt has risen to above US$14bn. However, these payments will be phased out gradually over 12 years and improvements to Codelco's investment capacity will occur in the medium term.
Codelco's investment plan comprises five major projects: the underground transformation of Chuquicamata (due in 2019); construction of a new mine level at the company's underground El Teniente mine (with start-up due in 2023); the expansion of processing capacity at its Rajo Inca and Andina mines (due in 2021 and 2025 respectively); and an expansion at the Radomiro Tomic mine (due for completion in 2021). Codelco's production reached 1.8m tonnes in 2018, down slightly from 1.84m tonnes in 2017. Although the company will struggle to maintain output at current levels in 2019-20, new capacity will steadily boost production from 2021 onwards.
Demand from Asia will continue to drive the market, particularly from a rapidly urbanising China, which currently accounts for around 40% of global copper demand. This will provide support for copper demand, but overall Chinese economic growth is expected to moderate in the years to come, and the price of copper will not return to the historical high of 400 US cents/lb in 2011, during the forecast period. Instead, after a trough to an average of 221 US cents/lb in 2016, copper prices have recovered and our forecast sees them edging steadily higher, averaging 295 US cents/lb in 2019-20, and rising to an average of 344 US cents/lb in 2021-23. Although lower than the 2011 peak, this is still high by historical standards.

Despite signs that monetary tightening will be less sharp in 2019 than initially expected, we nevertheless expect consumer price inflation to remain contained, owing to a relatively steady peso. In June the annual inflation rate was 2.3%, at the lower end of the BCCh's 2-4% target range, but we expect the rate to rise slightly to 2.8% by end-2019. Lower inflation so far this year has been driven by a fall in the price of energy and food products. We expect inflation to remain firmly within the 2-4% target range in 2020-23, reflecting the impact of a weaker economy in 2020 in particular, and strong confidence in the inflation-targeting framework, which helps to contain inflation expectations in the event of supply shocks.

As has been evident in recent months, the currency will remain vulnerable to shifts in copper prices and global risk sentiment. Nevertheless, we expect moderately high and rising copper prices and firmer external demand for Chile's exports to support the peso over the forecast period. The peso is forecast to strengthen slightly in 2019 as the current-account deficit narrows. This will bring the exchange rate from Ps695.7:US$1 at end-2018 to Ps681.8:US$1 at end-2019. Despite some weakening in 2020, amid diminished investor appetite related to lower global growth, rising copper prices will support the peso in 2021-23, which is forecast to average Ps664.3:US$1. The BCCh will have access to ample international reserves (US$40.2bn in July) with which to prevent excessive fluctuations, tied particularly to shifts in copper prices.

The current-account deficit will narrow in 2019-20 (after peaking in 2018) as import growth eases and higher copper prices in 2020 boost the trade surplus. The deficit will widen to 2.6% of GDP in 2021, owing to a larger primary income deficit-following rising debt-service obligations and profit repatriation by multinational firms based in Chile-before narrowing gradually to 1.9% in 2023. The trade surplus will fluctuate in a narrow range of 1-2% of GDP in 2019-23. The services deficit will remain broadly stable, averaging 1.4% of GDP in 2019-23 owing to steady tourist revenue flows. The secondary income (transfers) surplus will decline slightly as a share of GDP, reflecting higher outward workers' remittance flows due to a rise in inward migration.
Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) will rise in nominal terms, supported by a recovery in copper prices (the mining sector typically accounts for a large proportion of inward FDI flows), as well as renewed business confidence under the Piñera government. Nevertheless, as a percentage of GDP, inward FDI will remain below its highs in 2005-15, reflecting the post-commodity-boom era. Net portfolio inflows are expected to remain elevated in 2019-23. Chile's deep, open financial system will support high debt and equity-investment inflows in the medium term. Foreign-exchange reserves are forecast to rise to around US$43bn by end-2023, while import cover will decline slightly but remain adequate, at an average of 4.8 months of imports in 2022-23.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Chile
Stocks and flows
Despite its small size, Chile has historically been an important destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in its mining, energy and transport infrastructure sectors. FDI flows can fluctuate widely from year to year, often reflecting the fortunes of the copper mining industry. FDI fell dramatically between 2015 and 2017, from US$21.1bn to US$5.9bn. However, the decline bottomed out in 2018 and a recovery appears to be taking hold in 2019, with first-quarter FDI of US$2.4bn. Chile's favourable climate for foreign businesses pushed the stock of FDI to US$211.8bn in 2018, according to IMF data, resulting in an FDI stock/GDP ratio of 71%, compared with much smaller ratios for Brazil (40.8%) and Mexico (44.7%). Chile's importance as an investor in other regional markets has also increased in recent years, with a focus on the airline, shipping and retail sectors. However, outward flows have declined considerably in recent years, and totalled just US$4.8bn in 2017, down from an annual average of US$15.9bn in 2011-15. This reflected a global decline in crossborder mergers and acquisitions activity, and also political uncertainty throughout Latin America (where most Chilean outward investment flows) ahead of a busy election season in the region. A large stock of outward FDI in 2016 valued at US$95.4bn, equivalent to 34.4% of GDP, according to data from the Banco Central de Chile (the central bank), is testament to the success of Chilean firms abroad.
Origin and distribution
Chile's largest source of accumulated FDI stock was Brazil in 2017, which accounted for 14.6% of the total stock of FDI, up from 14.1% in 2016 according to the latest available central bank data. Argentina, Colombia, the US, Peru and Switzerland combined accounted for a further 35.8%. FDI broadly supports major investments in the mining, energy, agrarian (especially wine), wholesale and retail, telecommunications, financial services, and construction and infrastructure sectors. The latter is driven by foreign firms finding opportunities under the government's public-private partnership concessions. However, much of the FDI flowing into Chile is routed through tax havens such as the Bahamas, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Panama-which between them contributed a further 28% of the debt stock in 2017-making it difficult to ascertain the true countries of origin. Regarding the sectoral distribution of FDI stocks, financial services accounted for 28.1% of the total in 2017, followed by mining (26.8%) and utilities (electricity, gas and water, at 5.7%). Other important sectors that have attracted significant foreign investment in recent years include manufacturing, transport, communications, real estate and business services, and retail.
Determinants
Chile's foreign investment regime, which has been in place for three decades, is one of the most liberal in the world. There is a well-respected principle of non-discrimination between local and foreign investors, who also enjoy additional protection as a result of the rapidly expanding network of investment-protection accords and double-taxation treaties signed with other countries. Generally sound regulation, combined with political and economic stability, and firm growth, have helped to support FDI inflows since the early 1990s. Moreover, Chile's managerial talent and well-qualified labour force (by regional standards), together with a strong rule of law, low crime rates and a large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs), have attracted a growing number of multinationals to use Chile's capital, Santiago, as a headquarters for Latin America. Moreover, the entry of Chile into the OECD in 2010 made it subject to various investment-related provisions and guidelines relating to liberalisation of capital movements and trade in services (including business and financial services, insurance, culture, tourism, and travel).
Impact
FDI had funded a growing share of gross fixed investment in Chile since the 1990s. In 2001-06 FDI funded 28% of gross fixed investment, contributing to the modernisation of infrastructure, including telecoms. The ratio rose to an annual average of 37.8% in 2007-15, owing to large mining and energy investments. Although it has slipped significantly since, reaching just 9.6% in 2018, it is expected to rise modestly to an annual average of 11.5% in 2019-23. FDI has made a major contribution in terms of the transfer of technology and managerial expertise, and has helped to foster competition between local and foreign firms in most major consumer markets, thereby providing Chileans with wider product ranges and lower prices than in neighbouring countries. Outward FDI has also grown as Chilean businesses expanded abroad, which has helped to establish many local firms as important regional players in their respective sectors. Although outward FDI flows dropped to a lowly US$1.9bn in 2018, from an annual average of US$11.7bn in 2008-17, this is still a robust level (outward FDI stock totalled US$95.4bn in 2017, according to the central bank). The fact that Chilean firms operated in a competitive domestic environment, well before regional peers had liberalised their own economies, has enabled businesses to position themselves successfully in neighbouring countries. This has been most evident in the retail sector, where firms such as Ripley, Paris and Falabella have aggressively expanded into other markets such as Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil.
Potential
Chile will continue to attract large FDI inflows, owing to its transparent business operating conditions, political stability, a fundamentally sound economy, a huge network of FTAs, double-taxation and investment-protection accords, the most modern infrastructure in Latin America, and a growing pool of skilled labour. Nevertheless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to average a modest 2.4% of GDP annually in 2019-23, well below the level of 9% of GDP recorded in the bonanza years of 2008-15, during the commodities supercycle. The major acquisitions that have been common in the banking, telecoms and utilities sectors over the past two decades are unlikely to be repeated at the same pace, given already near-complete levels of economic openness and liberalisation. Nevertheless, the services sector (for example) will have ample opportunities in a market in which incomes are expected to continue to grow steadily. Renewable energy and related industries (such as lithium extraction) will also attract significant investment.

Working-age population grows slowly while overall demographic profile ages
Chile's annual population growth rate is forecast to decelerate gradually, from 1.4% in 2018 to close to zero by 2023. This will bring the total population to 19.2m in 2023, leaving Chile the least populated of Latin America's seven largest economies, and the only one of the seven with a population below 20m in 2023. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Chile (the national statistics office) projects that the rate of natural population growth-the crude birth rate minus the death rate-will continue to slow, from 8.6 per 1,000 people annually in 2010-15 to 7.4 in 2015-20, and to 6.2 in 2020-25. Although Chile displays a maturing demographic profile, the share of the working-age population will remain roughly stable, at around 68% of the total, in 2019-23. The rise in the share of the population above working age (13.6% will be 65 or older by 2023) will bring this figure to among the highest of the 12 Latin American countries covered by The Economist Intelligence Unit's Country Forecasts.
Chile has traditionally been an immigrant-receiving country, although not to the same extent as other South American nations such as Argentina or Brazil. Before the second world war, migration largely came from Europe and the Middle East, whereas since the 1970s most migrants have come from neighbouring Peru and Bolivia, with migrants often working in low-skilled jobs in agriculture and construction, or as domestic help. However, the pace of inward migration has accelerated since 2005, with the number of foreigners in the country increasing by 123% between 2005 and 2014, to around 416,000. This represented the highest proportion of foreign-born people living in Chile since 1920. In 2017 the government estimated that there were around 1m foreigners living in the country, of which around 300,000 were undocumented.
The surge in immigration is a consequence of the arrival of large numbers of Venezuelans and Haitians, prompted by humanitarian crises in their countries-and an increase in economic migrants from countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic-attracted by the higher wages and quality of life. We expect net inward migration to continue, given Chile's relative prosperity, but expect it to proceed at a more moderate pace than in 2015-17, as the government has instituted new laws to control the inward flow. Outward migration from Chile peaked during the 1973-90 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, but has slowed since then. The government estimates that around 500,000 Chileans live abroad, largely in Argentina, the US and Sweden.
Inward immigration will not boost overall population growth
Chile's basic health indicators are similar to those of other OECD countries, reflected in an average life expectancy of 80 years in 2019-23 (82.4 years for women and 77.5 years for men) and infant mortality of 6.1 per 1,000 live births. Demand pressures on the healthcare system are more akin to those of an industrialised country than a developing one. Infectious diseases and problems such as malnutrition are largely under control outside of small pockets of extreme poverty. However, age and "lifestyle-related" conditions associated with sedentary living and increased consumption of processed foods-such as obesity (75% of the population are overweight or obese), heart disease, colon cancer and diabetes-are on the rise.
Public healthcare policies will increasingly target obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. Only 2.5% of children under six years old were at risk of malnutrition in 2010, but 13.1% were overweight and 9.7% were obese. A universal healthcare plan, the Plan de Acceso Universal con Garantías Explícitas, was created in 2005 and offers fixed-price treatments for 80 conditions, including many expensive illnesses. The policy is sold at a fixed price and guarantees a maximum waiting time for medical attention for each condition. The public system covers around 80% of the population, against 17% covered by private insurance. The current government has introduced plans to reduce waiting times and increase the accessibility of care in the public system, but no major reforms to the provision of care are being contemplated.
Labour market reform will fail to incorporate informal workers
Modest growth in the working-age population will add some pressure to the labour market in the medium term. The economy was close to full employment in 2013-15, with average unemployment at a historical low of 5.8%. But weaker growth has caused unemployment to rise since then, to 7.2% in May-June 2019. This is still low by regional standards. Informality is estimated to cover around 36% of the labour force, according to the OECD; a low figure by Latin American standards (it is frequently over half, even in large economies). However, the informal sector represents a large pool of untapped labour, which could-if brought into the formal market-boost long-term growth and tax revenue.

Chile's market opportunities are constrained by its small population, at 18.7m in 2018 (forecast to grow to 19.2m by 2023), but its high income-combined with a legacy of political stability and effective economic management-will continue to make the country an attractive destination for investment in the region. In the past three decades it has generally outperformed all of the other economies in Latin America in terms of GDP growth, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects slower but still firm expansion of 3.1% on average in 2019-23. Inequality has been decreasing over the past decade, allowing a larger share of the population to access consumer goods and services. Low levels of unemployment and rising real incomes have supported this trend. However, inequality is still pronounced, and there are also income discrepancies between metropolitan and northern regions, and less affluent regions in the centre-north and centre-south.
Potential for more exports and import purchases will remain strong
The impact of weaker economic growth and sharp peso depreciation will begin to ease, with Chile's GDP per head in US dollar terms rising to US$16,441 in 2019 (from US$15,921 in 2018), and forecast to reach US$20,433 by 2023. According to IMF data for 2018, Chile's GDP per head (as measured in US dollars at purchasing power parity) is by far the highest in Latin America (excluding Panama and certain Caribbean countries). Along with rising incomes, consumption will increase over the next five years (albeit at a slower pace than in the previous five-year period), to reach US$12,896 per head by 2023. Chile's open economy and abundance of natural resources have encouraged specialisation in export-orientated activities, particularly mining. Copper and other minerals have long been Chile's export revenue mainstays, but a slump in global prices in 2015-17 provided an additional spur to non-traditional exports after years of policies promoting trade diversification. Chile is the world's second-largest salmon exporter (despite having no native salmon population), the fifth-largest wine exporter (and seventh-largest producer) and the largest regional exporter of fresh fruit. The country also has a fast-growing tourism sector. However, Chile's potential is limited by its small manufacturing base, which is dominated by agro-industrial output. As a result, a large share of consumer goods-such as electronics, cars and clothing-are imported. The share of imports in household expenditure will rise in 2019-23 as higher levels of discretionary spending boost demand for more diverse and expensive foreign goods.

The Chilean market is competitive, with a strong foreign presence
Consumer markets in Chile are well developed and competitive, owing to a free-market-orientated economy that has encouraged participation by foreign firms, as well as import penetration for a wide range of consumer goods. This has helped to bring prices down and attract a large number of participants, despite the small size of the economy, in effect turning it into a showcase market for firms wishing to expand in the region. For example, around 50 car brands compete in the Chilean market, including Chinese and Indian firms.
Other highly competitive sectors include telecommunications and retail. A deep and sophisticated financial sector, which has historically benefited from ample credit supply, relatively low interest rates and narrow loan-deposit spreads, supports consumer expenditure. Large foreign and local firms co-exist in the banking and insurance sectors, with the insurance sector enhanced by high and rising statutory obligations. The private pension market is highly liquid and-uniquely among Latin American economies-has created a large pool of institutional investors, thus deepening local capital markets. Despite this, the conservative lending practices of the banking system mean that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often find it difficult to obtain financing; these constraints do not present a problem for larger blue-chip firms, which can access a wider range of financing options. In addition, there has been an expansion by retail chains into consumer lending (and even into mortgage lending and insurance brokerage) in recent years. Although this has helped to boost credit availability to some of Chile's lower-income households, there are concerns over the looser lending standards of retailers.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Chile's long-term outlook benefits from continued adherence to prudent monetary and fiscal policies, coupled with a commitment to the rule of law and protection of property rights. A wide network of bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) will continue to help Chile to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), while simultaneously assisting local firms to expand abroad. It has also helped to diversify the economy into areas in which the country previously lacked comparative advantages, although a pronounced bias towards mining-the country's single largest industry and source of exports-will persist. Chile's efforts to become a regional platform for multinational corporations will continue, facilitated by its reputation for stability and security, its well-developed financial system, and the quality of its transport and communications infrastructure, as well as a comprehensive network of FTAs, double-taxation agreements and investment-protection accords. Chile's track record in raising real incomes has made progress, with GDP per head-in US dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP)-increasing from 20% of US GDP per head in 1990 to 40.4% in 2018. This gradual convergence will continue as growth outpaces that of the US, to reach a forecast 43.1% by 2023.
Initial conditions: Chile is a small country, representing only a 0.25% share of the world population in 2018, but it overachieves in its share of world GDP (0.35% at PPP), and global exports are strong (0.4% of the total). Chile's GDP per head of US$15,920 in 2018 at market rates was the highest among Latin American economies (excluding the Caribbean). In PPP terms, GDP per head was US$25,280 in 2018, also the highest among non-Caribbean Latin American countries. In 2010 Chile was the second country in the region (after Mexico) to become a member of the OECD. Chile will continue to attract manufacturing investment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind that of its Asian rivals. Chile will continue to find success in non-traditional production such as agro-industry and fisheries, and possibly some consumer goods, once Asia's labour-cost advantages erode. As a commodity producer, Chile faces more volatile terms of trade than its Asian competitors, whose comparative advantage is founded on low-cost manufacturing rather than raw materials. This implies that Chile's growth will remain strongly linked to international copper prices for the foreseeable future. The peso remains weak against its 20-year average, which will help to boost competitiveness for non-mining exports.
Demographic trends: Although Chile's population is still young by international standards, its demographic profile is ageing. Annual population growth will average just over 0.3% in 2018-30; the working-age population is expected to continue to grow, owing to a drop in young-age dependency. However, the working-age group will start to shrink from 2022, which will bring a rise in the dependency ratio. Despite Chile's relative affluence and the quality of its social services, immigration has not significantly contributed to overall population growth in recent decades. Although it may begin to do so over the next decade, the effect will not be significant. As a result, the demographic outlook will be dominated by trends among the native-born population, whose birth rates will continue to fall.
External conditions: Growth in export industries will be boosted by Chile's large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs). However, the single most important external factor affecting the Chilean economy is the international price of copper. Prices have fallen substantially, from a peak of 400 US cents/lb in 2011 to a low of 196 US cents/lb in December 2015, owing to the global slowdown and the end of the so-called commodities supercycle. The copper price has since recovered to average almost 300 US cents/lb in 2019, but remains at the mercy of global sentiment. In the long term, however, demand growth from China and India, as well as other emerging economies, will keep copper prices high by historical standards. Chile has diversified its export base over the past 15 years, notably into non-traditional sectors such as fruit, salmon and wine. Nonetheless, mining (mainly copper) still accounts for approximately half of total exports, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this dominance to diminish only marginally, given Chile's unique geological and geographical advantages in natural-resource extraction. Service exports will also grow, benefiting from Chile's position as a regional business hub. Open and liquid capital markets make the country the most developed financial centre in the region-and smaller in size only than Brazil and Mexico-with ample crossborder opportunities in banking, insurance and securities markets arising from deeper regional integration. Finally, growing international awareness of the country's significant natural beauty will provide a major boost to tourism in the medium and long term.
Institutions and policy trends: Chile will maintain its strong pro-market policy direction of the past three decades. However, social pressures and the rising expectations of the middle classes will lead to an increase in public-sector participation in certain sectors. Governments will dramatically extend state funding of university places (tertiary education currently remains highly market-orientated) and renewable energy. Civil-service reforms will support bureaucracy efficiency and transparency, and steps to reduce red tape will benefit the business environment as administrative procedures are simplified. Modernisation of the judiciary will accelerate legal procedures, which already benefit from one of the most independent and least corrupt judicial systems globally. Governance will be characterised by professionalism and credibility, offering investors minimal risks of policy reversals. Public frustration with graft and collusion will prompt reforms to reduce corruption. Constitutional reform will lead to a degree of symbolic decentralisation and a more parliamentary (rather than presidential) system of government.
Long-term performance: Chile's tradition of policy continuity, abundant natural resources, a favourable investment climate and modern infrastructure will be supportive of firm economic growth in the long term. The Chilean economic model will remain investment- and export-led, based on solid macroeconomic fundamentals, monetary stability and countercyclical fiscal management. Productivity growth will be helped by investments in new technologies and a gradual move towards higher value-added activities (made evident by the shift from agriculture to agro-industry). The financial sector will remain competitive, owing to a large pool of institutional investors (private pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies), providing businesses and households with ample financing through credit and capital markets.
In the long term, modernisation of the education system and a more flexible labour market will be necessary to unlock higher potential growth; both of these issues are being slowly tackled by the current government led by Sebastián Piñera. The linking of Chile's north and central-south electricity grids could prove the catalyst for a revitalisation of the country's fragile energy matrix, which has resulted in Chile having some of the highest energy costs in the region. The lack of major fossil fuel reserves will provide an impetus towards developing renewable energy sources, and the country is on course to meet a target of 20% power generation via renewables in 2020, five years ahead of schedule (a long-term objective of 70% by 2050 appears more than feasible). At the same time, there is significant opposition to major hydroelectric projects on environmental grounds, and some green alternatives such as solar energy remain expensive, suggesting that Chile will be burdened by energy insecurity in the medium term. Overall, we forecast that average annual GDP growth will reach 2.8% in 2019-30, falling to 2.3% in 2031-50. As growth in the working-age population slows, economic expansion will become more dependent on productivity gains and less so on the contribution of labour.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Chile's long coastline and diverse topography leave it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Changing climate dynamics will increase the likelihood and severity of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and landslides. These will directly disrupt some sectors of the economy, including agriculture and tourism, and glacial retreat will especially affect water resources. According to climate change projections by Chile's meteorological office, Chile's south-central area and the northern part of Patagonia should see temperatures rise and precipitation fall by around 60% between 2030 and 2059. Given that this is the heart of Chile's agricultural region-and also its farmed salmon industry-this will have a serious impact on the Chilean economy. Temperature rises affecting the oceans will also affect sea life, leading to a reduction in both the abundance and the diversity of species. This has been felt to some extent already in recent years, with an El Niño effect in 2016 disrupting the fishing industry, and a major drought affecting the country in 2018. The drought caused the government to declare a water emergency in 61 communes amid water shortages, and 102 communes declared an agricultural emergency. The Universidad de Chile says that at least 25% of the factors contributing to that year's drought reflect human action.
On June 4th 2019 the government unveiled a climate action plan that would shut all coal power plants by 2040, and target carbon neutrality by 2050, meaning the country would emit no more heat-trapping carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions than can be absorbed in its forests. Although a climate change law is still in its early stages, it is expected to establish a medium- and long-term framework for climate impact reduction, and create the institutions to manage climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Chilean economy will be 2.6% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
An ageing demographic profile
Chile's demographic profile shows an increasing proportion of the population over 65 years old. In 2018 around 11.5% of the population was over 65 years old. This is expected to climb to around 17% of the population by 2030. This makes Chile one of the oldest populations in Latin America and the Caribbean (behind only Cuba and Uruguay). In addition to a lower birth rate, this also reflects an increase in life expectancy in the past 20 years as Chile has become a more affluent society. The ageing of the population presents a unique challenge for a developing country, where (until recently) providing sufficient economic growth and jobs for a working-age population was the biggest task.
The effect of Chile's ageing population has already been seen in the country's politics, with the state of the country's pension system becoming a major issue in the 2017 election. The government has also had to address the fiscal costs of an ageing population by promoting the hiring of senior citizens (to keep them in the workforce) and incentivising the postponement of retirement. The government has also sought to increase the number of doctors specialising in geriatrics working in the public health system, and to adapt urban infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the elderly. The shrinking percentage of the working-age population as a percentage of the overall population has also made immigration more attractive to Chilean policymakers. The country has bowed to political pressure to standardise its immigration system after a large inflow in 2015-17, but still remains committed to welcoming regulated inward immigration.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the trigger for some kind of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. [...]the US introduced new sanctions in August, the most important of which is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system. [...]the US administration's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. [...]power cuts are now very frequent-owing to severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable. We currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, whom we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we expect that there will be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
Our expectation of a change of government by end-2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and EU members of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry.
The pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of a new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands by multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals, and by the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2019-23, up from 80th in the historical period. Assuming regime change, improvements are expected, but it will take time for reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment to bear fruit.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures such as price controls, but concerns over political instability slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt to attract investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on private-sector access to foreign currency remain.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but declining risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Large-scale emigration of skilled labour complicates hiring.
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid means that rationing and unpredictable blackouts continue. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to an estimated US$18.8bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 2% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable. We currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures, and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. At present, we assume regime change by the end of 2019, but the timing and shape of the transition process remains highly uncertain. We expect the entire 2019-23 forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Our forecast for regime change is based on the extent of the economic and humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Venezuela. This has deeply damaged support for Mr Maduro among the population at large; we believe that it will ultimately erode his backing among key supporters in the military who are propping him up in power. It is less clear, however, what the exact trigger for regime change will be. There are three main paths to a political transition: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as very low. Although negotiations are ongoing (in Barbados, sponsored by Norway), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis.
We therefore believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup of some kind. Owing to expanding US sanctions, Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee the regime's raison d'être-the enrichment of its members-and so we expect pragmatists within government and within the military to turn on him and pave the way for some sort of political transition. However, a failed uprising on April 30th demonstrated the difficulty of this sort of initiative, and has incurred a heavy political cost, as the regime has become ever more vigilant of discontent among its ranks. Nevertheless, the April uprising, which apparently included the participation of top-ranking government officials alongside Mr Guaidó, confirmed the existence of cracks within the regime's ranks at the highest levels. Our forecast for regime change therefore still stands.
This forecast is underpinned by three key assumptions. The first is that regime pragmatists will prevail over hardliners. Despite the ongoing collapse of the patronage system, there are risks to this assumption, in view of frequent purges within the military and the presence of dozens of important military figures, leading to co-ordination problems. Secondly, we are assuming that regime members will deem amnesty offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside Venezuela (a credible fear, given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking against regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a government transition is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this forecast come in the form of greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities that could provide the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
We recognise the very high risks to our baseline view, and believe there are two main alternate scenarios. The first, and more likely, of these is the maintenance of the status quo, with the population protest-weary, the regime hunkering down, the opposition deflating, and the country becoming increasingly isolated and impoverished. The second is one of prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict among regime factions. That said, we expect neither of these scenarios to be feasible in the medium to long term: with no prospect of real reform, we believe that a chronically weak economy will ultimately make Mr Maduro's position untenable. Moreover, violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the trigger for some kind of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. For these reasons, we continue for now to believe that regime change in the forecast period remains likely, even if it does not occur in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. Although this timeline is extremely ambitious, given the scale of the task, we tentatively expect national elections to take place by the end of 2020 under a transitional government. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary (and forthcoming). The task will be huge, as deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority, to the electoral registry and to the voting system will be required, and rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult. If the Maduro regime manages to maintain the status quo, legislative elections would take place in December 2020.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised his presidency. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. Indeed, the US introduced new sanctions in August, the most important of which is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system. Moreover, the US administration's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative lacks international legitimacy. However, if tension ratchets up and domestic violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and the state oil company, PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in terms of investment. We believe that Russia and (especially) China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt to protect their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy to rein in hyperinflation and to abandon foreign-exchange controls (with few foreign reserves left to protect). However, we believe that such efforts are doomed to failure in the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform and improvements in rule of law and policy predictability that will not be forthcoming under the present regime.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and European countries of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and how this might be impaired by probable demands by multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals (totalling US$46bn in 2020-23) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. Meanwhile, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself up to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit this year to remain well in double-digit levels as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Under our expectation of substantial currency adjustment, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise dramatically in coming years; however, our forecasts assume that a combination of debt restructuring and deep fiscal adjustment will gradually bring the ratio under control. The process will be complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds and all but one of PDVSA's bonds are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. A US appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. That said, the latest US sanctions forbid the transfer of Venezuelan assets, which would, for the time being, shield Citgo and its Caribbean facilities, which the US government now considers to be under Mr Guaidó's purview.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary stabilising effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise to some extent in recent months. We expect monthly inflation to rise again in the short term, given that underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. However, given our assumption that a transition government that places a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation will soon come to power, we do not currently project a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced during 2018 (although there are substantial political risks to this forecast). Instead, under a new government, we expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of an emergency macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency, a temporary peg or outright currency substitution in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 18.5% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. Our forecast of an economic recovery in 2021-23 assumes a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of about 60% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts are now very frequent-owing to severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.
Our forecast for a recovery in investment from 2020 assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment. We expect oil output to bottom out at 700,000 barrels/day (b/d) in the coming quarters, prevented by PDVSA's joint-venture partners from slipping lower. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government later in 2019, oil production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period in 2023 well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will start to recover in 2020 on the back of recovery in the oil sector, but a rise in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb some of the projected increase in oil output. Import demand will rise sharply in 2020. Taken together, this will initially constrain the rebound of GDP, but we expect real GDP growth to gather pace in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, dollar constraints on import capacity, and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant gap between these and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. These have indicated some disinflation in recent months, with monthly inflation falling below the hyperinflation threshold of 50% per month. Huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand persist, however, and we expect inflation to remain extremely high for as long as the Maduro regime stays in power. On the basis of our assumption of regime change in the short term, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation, but supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our baseline forecast of political transition by end-2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) to try to tackle inflation is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such moves is hard to predict. Our forecasts assume extremely large currency adjustments that restore some competitiveness to the local currency in real terms over time. For now, and with few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime has announced a loosening of currency controls. However, access to dollars via formal means will remain extremely difficult and we believe that the foreign-exchange system will remain highly controlled in practice. In this environment, a strong black-market exchange-rate premium is likely to re-emerge. By end-July the premium had widened but was still small by historical comparison, with the official rate at BsS11,250:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of almost BsS12,600:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela continued to post current-account surpluses in this period on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. However, we continue to project a shift into current-account deficit this year, in view of the collapse of export earnings stemming from US sanctions on the oil trade. This deficit will emerge despite the non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). We have also excluded repayments to Chinese lenders, to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data, on which our debt forecasts are based. Later in the forecast period we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, but we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been severely reduced. These factors will keep the current account in deficit, although we expect the shortfall to narrow to a manageable level of around 3% of GDP towards the end of the forecast period.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this outlook. It hinges on substantial IMF finance, rapid macroeconomic stabilisation, speedy resolution of a debt renegotiation process, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Italy--highlights: Political outlook
The March 2018 general election was a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of the vote, and the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration Lega, which took 17.4%. After protracted negotiations the two agreed to form a coalition government in late May of that year. The government is led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent close to M5S. Mr Conte's deputy prime ministers are Luigi Di Maio, the leader of M5S, and Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, who has thus far overshadowed Mr Di Maio with his brash, populist rhetoric. Giovanni Tria, a technocrat economist, serves as economy and finance minister. The administration will continue to challenge EU rules on migration and fiscal policy. It has partially reversed recent pension and labour reforms and implemented a means-tested "citizenship income" for job-seekers. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to fall over the coming budget fight, leading to a snap poll in 2020.

Italy's business environment score remains broadly unchanged during the forecast period (2019-23). The macroeconomic environment score is broadly stable, but owing to improvements in other countries, Italy slips by five places in our global ranking and by one place in the regional ranking. Deteriorations in the scores for political stability and effectiveness, and market opportunities have been offset by marginal improvements in the scores for policy towards financing and the labour market. Italy's tax system remains one of the biggest hindrances to businesses and foreign investment. Compliance is costly and tax evasion remains widespread.

Domestic political uncertainty and policy choices have been weighing on the economy since mid-2018. Real GDP growth is expected to slow from 0.7% in 2018 to about 0.3% on average in 2019-20, owing to a cyclical downturn, policy uncertainty and weaker external conditions. Growth will rise to an average of 1.1% in 2021-23 as domestic and global demand recover. The M5S-Lega administration will seek to loosen fiscal policy as much as possible. Debt/GDP will remain at about 130% for the duration of the forecast period, and we do not expect the M5S-Lega government to enact any meaningful structural reforms. Instead, it has proposed a raft of tax and spending policies and has diluted recent structural reforms.

We expect the population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 60.1m in 2023, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows.

Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 46% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average just 0.8% per year in 2019-50. A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had three broad centre-left/centre-right governments. Matteo Renzi's resignation as prime minister-after his flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum in December 2016-led to the formation of a government led by Paolo Gentiloni, a close ally of Mr Renzi. Following the 2018 general election an M5S-Lega government was formed.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December 2016 referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house). A new, predominantly proportional electoral system was adopted in October 2017.
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which stood at 132.2% of GDP in 2018), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process has since stalled, and the M5S-Lega government will seek to loosen fiscal policy, stimulate private consumption through tax cuts and income support to low earners, and seek to reverse or dilute recent pension and labour reforms.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes are levied, including the regional business tax (IRAP), to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.9%. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$537.5bn in 2018, and imports (fob) were worth US$481.9bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$50.6bn, or 2.4% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The March 2018 general election yielded a badly fragmented parliament. The centre-right coalition fell short of the roughly 40% of votes needed to win a majority under the most recent electoral law, the so-called Rosatellum 2, coming in at 37%. Within the coalition, the populist, anti-immigration Lega (17.4%) surpassed Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI; 14%), which had previously been seen as the leading party on the right, and polled well ahead of the hard-right, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia (4.4%). The election also saw a surge in support for the populist, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of vote, making it by far the country's largest party. After three months of difficult coalition talks, M5S and the Lega agreed to form a coalition government under the leadership of a technocratic prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Meanwhile the mainstream centre-left Partito Democratico (PD), under the leadership of Matteo Renzi, won just 18.9% of the vote, an all-time low, leading to Mr Renzi's resignation and the election of a new party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in March 2019. The PD and its smaller coalition partners won a combined vote share of just 22.3%, and Liberi e Uguale (LeU)-a formation made up of primarily left-wing splinter parties that spun off from the PD in opposition to Mr Renzi's leadership-took 3.4% of the vote. In April 2019, LeU was dissolved, with some of its constituent parties realigning with the PD.

Political outlook: Political stability
Just over a year into its five-year term, the coalition government, composed of the anti-establishment M5S and the far-right Lega, is showing signs of strain. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the leader of the Lega, Matteo Salvini, will engineer a political crisis in an effort to force a snap election later this year, when frictions with M5S and with the EU surrounding the 2020 budget will provide an opportunity to withdraw from the coalition. The president, Sergio Mattarella, would have limited options but to grant Mr Salvini-who tops opinion polls-such a vote, which would probably be held in the first half of 2020. At this contest we expect the Lega to win a commanding majority in parliament at the head of a right-wing coalition, including the centre-right FI and the small, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia.
Mr Salvini will engineer a political crisis in an effort to force a snap election
The M5S-Lega government-led by Mr Conte, an independent law professor-came into office in the wake of the March 2018 general election. Since then, however, the Lega has dominated the administration under the leadership of Mr Salvini, a deputy prime minister and the minister of the interior. The Lega leader has struck a chord with Italian voters with his round-talking speeches, adept use of social media and a policy agenda focused on security issues, Euroscepticism and combating illegal immigration.
Meanwhile M5S's popularity has ebbed steadily under the leadership of Luigi Di Maio, also a deputy prime minister, and the minster of labour and economic development. Following disappointing performances in a series of regional and local elections in 2018-19 M5S won just 17% of the vote at the European Parliament elections in May 2019, compared with the Lega's 34%.
In early July, following weeks of tensions with the European Commission, the government narrowly avoided a debt-based excessive-deficit procedure (EDP) by adopting measures intended to reduce the 2019 budget deficit by EUR7.6bn, to 2% of GDP. Nonetheless, frictions between the government and EU institutions are likely to resume regarding the draft 2020 budget in October. The Lega and M5S stepped back from the brink of a near-crisis mid-month following the parties' divergent positions on appointments to the Commission, clashes over proposed legislation to deepen regional autonomy and the completion of the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link, which the Lega and Mr Conte support and much of M5S opposes. The Lega has also sought to deflect attention from a controversy involving the alleged solicitation of illicit funding from Russian businessmen by a former advisor to Mr Salvini.
In this context, drafting and finalising the 2020 budget will be challenging. The government will need to disarm the so-called safeguard clauses written into the country's multi-year fiscal framework. These would raise the headline value-added tax (VAT) rate from an already high 22% to 25.2% if EUR23bn (1.3% of GDP) is not raised through spending cuts or from other revenue sources. However, Mr Salvini is determined to have his costly flat-tax reform-thus far applied only to lower- and middle-income VAT-account holders-extended to the personal income of a portion of Italian citizens. A conflict over the country's fiscal framework would be likely to give Mr Salvini the justification he needs to leave the coalition.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Italy is governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system, all bills have to be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. This is unlikely to change following the rejection of the Renzi government's constitutional reform package in December 2016, which sought to reduce drastically the legislative powers of the Senate (the upper house of parliament) and would have effectively made the parliament quasi-unicameral. The new M5S-Lega administration bitterly opposed Mr Renzi's efforts to streamline the institutional framework, and further reforms are not a part of their law-making agenda.
Efficiency may improve in the public administration, but not in the judiciary
Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. However, modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to speed up gradually some bureaucratic procedures, although given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 is likely to be slow. The M5S-Lega administration has stated its intention to reduce red tape, but has not yet presented an ambitious, credible simplification programme. A partial reform of the judicial system was undertaken in 2014-16. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers that acts as a disincentive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. The average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute in Italy is more than double that in some other EU member states.
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of corruption scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then government action appears to have intensified. In June 2014 the powers of the anti-corruption authority were strengthened, and less than a year later parliament approved another anti-corruption law, including provisions eliminating the minimum threshold for the prosecution of accounting fraud and introducing harsher prison sentences for this offense, as well as for corruption of public officials, embezzlement and mafia association. The M5S-Lega government passed further anti-corruption legislation at end-2018, imposing harsher criminal penalties and public-office bans for graft, and, from 2020, applying the statute of limitations only to first-instance trials so that fewer cases are dismissed owing to a lengthy appeals process.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury, and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next parliamentary election is scheduled for early 2023, but we expect it to be held much sooner. The result of the European Parliament elections has raised the likelihood that the Lega will withdraw its support from the government later this year. When combined with the Lega's vote share of 34%, the shares of FI (9%) and Fratelli d'Italia (6%) come to about 50%, which would be likely to produce a commanding majority under Italy's voting law for general elections. This system, the so-called Rosatellum 2, allocates about one-third of the seats in each house of parliament in single-member districts and about two-thirds via proportional representation.
It is possible that M5S and the centre-left opposition party, the PD-having surpassed M5S at the European Parliament elections, with a vote share of 23%-will align in the event of a government crisis in order to avert an election in the near term that returns a right-wing government. However, the parliamentary mathematics would be difficult, particularly in the Senate, and the two parties would struggle to justify such a move to their respective electorates.
Political outlook: International relations
We expect Italy to remain a member of the EU and the euro zone during the 2019-23 forecast period. Other foreign policy mainstays-including a close relationship with the US, and membership of NATO and the UN-will also continue. However, relations are likely to be strained. Mr Salvini has signalled a more confrontational stance towards other EU countries, taking a tough line on migration measures, and has also protested against EU fiscal constraints.
Sino-Italian diplomatic relations will improve in the near term, following Italy's decision to sign in late March 2019 a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. The MoU is unlikely to increase bilateral trade or investment flows significantly in 2019-23, but it will probably undermine EU attempts to find a common stance on China, and complicate Italy's relations with other EU countries and the US.

Italy's business environment score improves only slightly during the forecast period (2019-23), but because of greater improvements in other countries Italy falls five places in the global ranking and one place in the regional ranking, to 16th. The scores for policy towards private enterprise and competition, taxes, financing and the labour market all improve, reflecting the impact of economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. However, the populist M5S-Lega government, in power since June 2018, is unstable and ineffective. Its repeated push-back against EU fiscal rules has resulted in an upward shift in government borrowing costs, hampering efforts to reduce taxation and weighing on already weak bank profitability.
Italy scores poorly for government effectiveness. Following the rejection of constitutional reforms in a referendum at end-2017, institutional reform is off the political agenda for the foreseeable future, although the M5S-Lega government has pushed ahead with plans to reduce radically the number of members of parliament. Reforms in 2014-16 have failed to resolve entrenched shortcomings in the judicial system. The modest economic recovery that got under way in 2014 has stalled since mid-2018, which will make it more difficult to promote investment and employment, and reduce public debt. These issues, as well as repairing weaknesses in the banking sector, remain the biggest policy challenges facing the government in 2019-23. Italy's tax system remains a hindrance to businesses and foreign investment, and evasion is widespread. The new government's costly tax reform plans have increased uncertainty about the direction of tax policy. Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets has made some progress, but the sector remains vulnerable.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Significant reforms to improve competition will not be a priority under the administration led by Giuseppe Conte.
2021-23: Improvements in competition policy will depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Modest reductions in red tape. Government plans to charge penalties to foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2021-23: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. The Conte government could oppose new EU trade deals. EU focuses on EU-UK trade deal in Brexit negotiations, further bilateral free-trade deals and responding to US tariffs.
2021-23: An EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive. The risk of a euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to leave the bloc in the medium term.
Taxes
2019-20: Automatic rise in value-added tax (VAT) rate is averted in 2019, but implementation of two-rate "flat tax" is delayed owing to cost. Reduction in tax expenditure and some tax rises in order to finance costly social spending plans.
2021-23: Government seeks to implement a diluted corporate and income tax-reduction package.
Financing
2019-20: Bank mergers, recapitalisations and non-performing loan sales are slow, not least because of political uncertainty.
2021-23: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market
2019-20: Firms remain reluctant to increase open-ended contract payrolls. "Citizenship income" is partly introduced. Some aspects of 2014-15 labour market reforms are reversed.
2021-23: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Lack of fiscal space constrains government plans for higher investment spending.
2021-23: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) presses for further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keep research and development (R&D) spending low.
2021-23: Gradually improving economic prospects (and Brexit) encourage more information and communications technology graduates to seek work in Italy. Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Italy's high public debt and political risk pose a threat to euro zone stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit's assessment of the macroeconomic environment focuses not on headline real GDP growth (measured in the market opportunities category), but on economic stability and the underlying policy framework, which influence business planning, hiring and investment. Italy's macroeconomic environment score deteriorates slightly in the forecast period, contributing to a fall of six places in our global ranking and three places in the regional ranking. Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenge remains reviving investment and economic growth, making it more socially inclusive, while also putting public debt on a sustainable downwards path. Italy's public debt and political instability will continue to be a cause for concern for the core euro zone creditor countries, as well as a risk to the survival of the bloc and to the stability of its financial sector.
Despite some progress, economic reforms were introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and further measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are unlikely in the current political environment. We expect Italy to keep its budget deficit within the EU's 3% of GDP limit and to continue generating primary surpluses (the budget balance excluding interest payments), but the public debt burden will remain at about 130% of GDP during the forecast period. Weak price growth will also complicate debt reduction in GDP terms. Demand-side price pressures will remain subdued owing to continued moderate household consumption and labour market slack, as well as modest wage growth. Export growth and moderate global energy prices will keep Italy's current account in surplus during the forecast period. Nevertheless, concerns remain over the erosion of the country's export competitiveness, stagnant productivity and escalating global trade tensions.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and justice system. Generally, EU directives have been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy and professional services. The powers of the Italian Competition Authority were strengthened and its remit extended to cover the provision of public services in 2010, but political pressure has generally limited effectiveness. This is also true of other watchdogs, including the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market, and the telecoms watchdog, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM).
External constraints will continue to be the main drivers of liberalisation
In 2012 the then-technocratic government, led by Mario Monti, which came to power in late 2011 when Italy was threatened with losing financial market access at the height of the euro zone crisis, introduced a range of measures, including provisions to increase competition in retailing, taxi services, the sale of pharmaceuticals, utilities and several professions, specifically law. We expect the M5S-Lega government to resist further liberalisation. Since taking office the government has either diluted or reversed previous reforms, such as the liberalisation of opening times in the retail sector, or blocked further liberalisation of services, including taxi facilities, with its "anti-Uber" decree.
In 2014-16 the Renzi government continued earlier progress in cutting red tape affecting businesses, streamlining the complex tax system and, in particular, simplifying and reducing regulation of the Italian labour market. The introduction of reforms has reduced the influence of minority shareholder local charitable foundations in Italy's co-operative banks (banche popolari), paving the way for greater competition, consolidation and mergers. Consolidation has made some progress, but has been slow owing to reticence to write down bad loans, as well as new EU bail-in rules that require banks to impose losses on shareholders and junior bondholders, who are often retail investors, in return for government support.
Weak contract enforcement will remain a deterrent of foreign direct investment
Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime, and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Improvements introduced in 2014-17 include extended prison sentences for some white-collar crimes such as bribery, the establishment of support offices to reduce the backlog in Italy's Supreme Court and an extension of the statute of limitations for serious crimes. However, political opposition and resistance from the judiciary remain strong, which will hamper implementation. With political instability likely to continue under the M5S-Lega government, further major reforms are unlikely.
Further privatisation of major state-controlled companies is unlikely
The privatisation plan that was re-launched in mid-2015 to highlight Italy's openness to foreign investment and reduce the level of public debt made little progress before the 2018 general election and is unlikely to be revived under the M5S-Lega government. Both parties have strenuously opposed the sale of state assets in the past. This means that the planned public offering of the state's remaining 30% stake in the national post office and financial services group, Poste Italiane, and the mooted sale of a 40% stake in Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's state-owned railway utility group, are unlikely to happen.
The M5S-Lega government's approach will be to increase the stakes of the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa (CDP)-the state-owned development bank-in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel, in order to boost revenue. The government is also likely to use its powers of appointment to expand its influence at the top of state-controlled companies by replacing senior executives and board members that were put in place by previous governments.
The M5S government's Decreto Dignità (dignity decree) introduced in 2018 contains a mix of measures including provisions to reduce the use of temporary employment contracts and discourage delocalisation (the relocation by firms of jobs to low-wage countries). Compensation for unfair dismissals has also been raised. The decree also requires the repayment of state incentives and subsidies with interest if a firm lays off workers in Italy to transfer production abroad.

The positive impact of economic reforms will only be felt incrementally
FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to complex bureaucratic and legal procedures, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Under past governments labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues, resulting in an improvement in Italy's score and rankings in this category. The new M5S-Lega government is more isolationist than its predecessors, and its programme contains no specific policies aimed at attracting FDI. However, in March 2019 Italy became the first G7 country to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative-China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. Given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies, and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU member states.
Judicial reforms introduced in 2014-17 should gradually improve contract enforcement, with signs that they are already reducing civil case backlogs. Legislation passed in 2015 should also encourage further financial sector consolidation, which could eventually attract FDI in the banking sector, although progress will be slow owing to political resistance. Bureaucratic complexity has dogged the sale of banks' securitised bad loans to foreign investors, but intense pressure from financial markets and new EU directives regarding provisioning will help to accelerate the process further. Although less ambitious than hoped for, anti-corruption legislation introduced since 2013 represents a further sign of intent to improve the operating environment for domestic and overseas investors. Over the medium term, the M5S-Lega government's anticorruption law may also have noticeable positive effects.
Foreign takeovers, especially of luxury goods brands, are likely to continue
Corporate balance sheets and the ability to raise capital were severely damaged by the 2011-14 economic downturn. As a result, in recent years foreign companies have acquired or merged with a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors, such as Bulgari, Valentino, Loro Piana and Luxottica. Despite signs of concerns among some law-makers regarding foreign takeovers, the trend is likely to continue during the forecast period. As illustrated by the Fiat takeover of Chrysler in 2014 and the acquisition by Atlantia in 2018 of its Spanish partner, Abertis, large Italian firms are seeking opportunities to invest abroad.

Italy's score in this category improves slightly in the forecast period, leading to large improvements in its global and regional ranking, owing to deteriorations or no improvements elsewhere. EU membership determines for the most part Italy's foreign trade and exchange policy. Full freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the EU (subject to transitional restrictions for newer member states), and we do not expect any exchange controls. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the jurisprudence of which has played a major role in developing the single market. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland is unrestricted under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EU also has a customs union with Turkey and a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland. All of these arrangements exclude agriculture.
In other sectors trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods, with average unweighted most-favoured-nation tariffs, which cover most countries, at about 4%. Trade between member states and third countries has been largely governed by multilateral agreements administered by the WTO. In 2015 the WTO reached an agreement on trade facilitation (reducing red tape at borders, and setting binding standards for customs and movement of goods internationally), but the Doha trade talks have stalled since 2008 and are unlikely to be revived.
The EU will focus on bilateral trade deals
The EU's focus will be on bilateral trade deals, as support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed amid heightened opposition to further trade liberalisation in some countries (notably the US). We expect the EU to make advances, but the backdrop will be challenging, given ongoing US-China trade tensions; a broader increase in global trade protectionist measures; a continued risk of a disruptive Brexit on the part of the UK; an increasing threat of additional US tariffs on EU imports, including those of cars (which would trigger a wider trade conflict as the EU defends its interests); and weaker global growth.
Trade deals between the EU and other trade blocs will be implemented gradually
In June 2019 the EU and Mercosur, the South American trading bloc, reached an agreement to create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people, following 20 years of negotiations. Assuming the deal is ratified in national parliaments (which will be a politically complex process, given opposition in some member states), phased-in measures will aim to eliminate about 90% of tariffs and provide greater access to agricultural and services markets, and to public procurement contracts, from 2021 at the earliest.
The EU-Japan economic partnership agreement took effect in early 2019, creating what is currently the world's largest free-trade area. Some tariffs will fall to zero this year, but most measures involve a lengthy transition phase. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada will gradually come into force in 2019-23. The CETA will eliminate most tariffs, simplify border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation.

Italy's tax system remains highly complex, so compliance is costly
Italy's score for taxation improves slightly in the forecast period, but the country ranks third from last in our global ranking and bottom in our regional ranking in 2019-23. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, the tax system remains complex, making compliance costly and time consuming for private-sector companies. Also, despite some modest tax cuts since 2014, the tax burden has remained high and is unlikely to decline much, owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements. Tax policy will remain highly uncertain under the M5S-Lega government.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue/GDP (including social security contributions) stood at 42.1% in 2018-slightly lower than in 2017, but higher than the regional aggregates of about 40-41% for the EU and the euro area. According to Eurostat data, Italy has the second highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base), after Greece. This was 42.4% in 2017 (latest available data), down from a high of 44.1% in 2013, but about 6 percentage points more than the EU average and almost 4 more than the euro area average. At 18.3% in 2017, up from 16.6% in 2009, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU and was about 2 percentage points lower than the regional average, highlighting that there is scope to shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour.
Despite promises to reduce labour taxes, they will remain high
Italy's rate of corporate tax for non-financial corporations is 24%, after a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017. Banks and most other financial sector firms, however, were excluded from the cut and continue to pay the 27.5% rate. In addition to a corporate tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). However, the central government can raise the regional business tax rate as high as 4.4% in regions running budget deficits. Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Companies pay social security contributions at a high rate, by international comparison, of 30% (9.5% for employees). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest in Europe), is significantly reduced. Currently the marginal personal income tax rate is 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR75,000.
Overhauling the tax system remains one of the policy priorities of the M5S-Lega government. But independent estimates put the cost of its initial reform plan at EUR50bn, making its full implementation unlikely without commensurate expenditure cuts, which would be politically unpopular and difficult to achieve. In the 2019 budget a flat tax of 15% was introduced for entrepreneurs and the self-employed. Plans to expand it in 2020 to small and medium-sized enterprises and to the personal income tax of low- and middle-income employees would cost up to an estimated EUR30bn. Currently the marginal personal income tax rate is 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR75,000.
Tax evasion and avoidance is widespread in Italy, encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, a limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. However, some progress was made during the crisis years. In addition to its costly tax overhaul plans the M5S-Lega government introduced a "tax peace" scheme in 2019, which was essentially an amnesty, and may be repeated in 2020. The government has also raised the limit on cash payments from EUR1,000 to EUR3,000 in 2019. The Lega had indicated that it wanted to abolish the limit altogether, but more recently appears keen to promote the use of electronic payments.

Fragmentation remains one of the main weaknesses of the banking sector
Italy's score and global ranking improves substantially in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation, support recapitalisation and try to tackle the issue of high NPLs. Nevertheless, the country still ranks below most other developed countries, which largely reflects delays in introducing reforms to address the Italian banking sector's weaknesses after the 2008-09 global crisis. The sector's major shortcomings are notably fragmentation, with few large banks and many small and medium-sized lenders; high operating costs, because of excessive branch networks and personnel costs; low profitability; uncertainty about the quality of supervision; and heavy exposure to the sovereign, which leaves them vulnerable when concerns about government-debt sustainability increase. NPLs have declined considerably in recent years, but are still high, at 8.3% of total credit as at end-March 2019. This is well down from 16.9% in the third quarter of 2015, but more than double the EU average of 3.1%. Much of the decline is the result of large NPL securitisation operations by a few major Italian banks. The reduction of the high levels of NPLs on the balance sheets of Italy's smaller banks has made much slower progress. Perhaps with a view to supporting these banks' efforts, the government has extended the system of guarantees (Garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) until May 2021. The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority on Italy's four major banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco Bpm and UBI Banca) in 2018 highlighted the improved health of Italy's banks compared with the EBA's stress tests in 2016.
Despite recent reforms, some consolidation and progress in reducing NPLs on banks' balance sheets, efforts to repair Italy's banking system have been beset with difficulties, largely relating to EU bail-in rules, which require losses to be imposed on shareholders and junior bondholders before government support can be granted. Although the state is ultimately likely to compensate small investors' losses, the bail-in rules have provided political capital for anti-establishment political parties and restricted government willingness to speed up bank resolutions.
Banca Carige, a small regional lender, has been under special administration since the beginning of 2019, but officials have so far been unable to find a private investor to rescue the bank. In order to avoid being wound down, the bank may be forced to request a "precautionary recapitalisation" from the state, as happened with the much larger Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) in 2016.
The return of political risk in May 2018 owing to uncertainty about the future direction of the M5S-Lega government's economic policies has pushed up Italian government benchmark ten-year government bond yields, albeit to still relatively low levels. After several years of contraction or stagnation, bank credit to the private sector has begun to recover. The stabilisation in lending marks an important development for Italy's large number of small and medium-sized enterprises that rely largely on bank borrowing for financing.
Amid global trade tensions and stuttering demand, especially in the euro zone and China, the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank) and the ECB have signalled that policy rates will be cut, reducing pressure on government borrowing costs, which eases pressure on the cost of bank credit. Financial market volatility could increase, however, if political instability continues or rises under the M5S-Lega government.

Recent reforms will reduce long-standing rigidities only gradually
Recent reforms have contributed to improving the labour market score and Italy's global ranking in the forecast period, but this category remains an area in which Italy performs poorly compared with its EU peers. The Jobs Act legislative package passed in 2014-15 was a welcome development, but because the main reforms only applied to new private-sector hires, it will only reduce long-standing rigidities gradually. The M5S-Lega government had promised to dismantle the Jobs Act, but its main focus has been to increase restrictions on the use of easily terminated fixed-term contracts. The measures in the government's Decreto Dignità appear to have had some success in this regard. It allows fixed-term contracts to be used for up to 24 months, compared with 36 months under the Jobs Act and 12 months prior to that. It also requires firms to provide a justification for the use of such contracts, which is likely to increase litigation, and pay an additional levy of 1.9% (up from 1.4%) when they extend a fixed-term contract. However, the cap of 20% of the workforce on temporary contracts for an individual firm remains unchanged. The decree also raised the minimum compensation for unfair dismissal from a minimum of four months' salary to six months and from a maximum of 24 months' salary to 36.
Other measures introduced under the Jobs Act that remain intact include reduced employment protection for long-term contracts and a much simplified contract system for labour market entrants by introducing a standard open-ended employment contract with gradually increasing protection. The Jobs Act also increased the availability of unemployment benefits and streamlined the use of wage guarantee funds for temporary lay-offs or firm restructuring. In 2018 the new national agency envisaged under the Jobs Act to co-ordinate the activities of all employment services providers became operative.
Reflecting the impact of a protracted recession, delayed reforms and weak economic recovery since late 2014, Italy's headline jobless rate remains high, at 9.9% in May 2019, compared with the euro area average of 7.5%. Youth unemployment remains high, despite increased emigration of young people, especially graduates. At 30.5%, the youth unemployment rate is the third highest in the euro area, where the average rate is 15.7%. Despite some recent improvement, Italian labour market participation remains low, particularly among women and young people. According to Eurostat, Italy's employment rate was 58.2% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the euro area average of 67.3%. The female employment rate was 49.6% (62.4% in the euro area).
In 2018 Italy's three main trade union confederations and the business association, Confindustria, agreed a new national wage bargaining framework. It provides the basis for sectoral accords at national level, as well as second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains. However, the M5S-Lega government appears determined to establish a national minimum wage, which could reduce wage flexibility if set too high. There is also some concern that the government's citizenship income scheme, which aims to reduce poverty, will act as a disincentive for people out of work to search for employment, resulting in higher structural unemployment.

Infrastructure quality in the south will continue to lag the rest of the country
As reflected in its unchanged score and the decline in its regional and global rankings, the quality of Italy's infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A significant disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment in the past 25-30 years, and local interest groups have succeeded in blocking or delaying several major projects in the transport and energy sectors. Corruption investigations are another relatively common reason for delays. As illustrated by the collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in August 2018, maintenance of existing infrastructure also remains an issue. Telecommunications costs have fallen and device ownership has risen, along with internet use and broadband penetration, but Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in these markets, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.
The economy minister, Mr Tria, has promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt servicing costs, combined with competing demands within the coalition, make a radical change in policy direction unlikely. M5S is opposing the continued construction of the high-speed rail link through the Alps, from Turin in the north east of Italy to Lyon, a major city in south-eastern France.
Fiscal consolidation will hold back public investment in infrastructure
Limited domestic energy sources and popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution is likely to keep upward pressure on costs. Investment will also continue to face strong local resistance.
After a slow start, government efforts to accelerate investment in fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks providing high-speed internet access will make progress. Central to the government's plans is Open Fiber, which is now jointly owned by Enel and CDP. Open Fiber plans to build FTTH networks in 270 cities in Italy, investing EUR3.7bn in the development of the network, EUR3bn of this by 2020. In June 2019 Telecom Italia, which plans to roll out its own fibre network, was in merger talks with Open Fiber. Co-operation between Open Fiber and Telecom Italia would avoid unnecessary duplication of the network.

Italy's technology readiness score deteriorates in the forecast period compared with the historical period, thereby contributing to falls in both our global and regional rankings. E-commerce is growing rapidly (up by 12% in value terms in 2018, according to Istat), reflecting improvements in the online environment. However, growth is from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales (compared with about 20% in the UK).
Mobile-phone penetration is one of the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive. Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D) low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. According to OECD data for 2017, total R&D spending (for both the public and private sectors) was the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP (compared with an OECD average of 2.4%).
Digitalisation of public services is a policy priority
The implementation of the Three-Year Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Public Administration in 2017-19 has facilitated steady progress. Digitalisation of public services remains one of the M5S's policy priorities.
We expect a slight improvement in R&D and firm-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base. According to the European Patent Office, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy increased by just 0.9% in 2018, compared with average growth in Europe of 3.8%, and only accounted for 2.5% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at just 70.7 per million population, ranking Italy just 20th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany, France and the UK.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The administration of the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the Lega has departed from the more orthodox policies of previous governments. With regards to the labour market, the administration passed the so-called Dignity Decree in July 2018, reversing parts of the 2015 Jobs Act, a liberalising labour market reform. In April 2019 the government implemented an expansionary pension reform, easing the conditions for early retirement.
One of the administration's other flagship policies, M5S's citizenship income, provides a monthly stipend or top-up of other benefits of up to EUR780 for poor pensioners and the unemployed.
The government has also implemented a first step towards the Lega's promised 15% flat income tax, applying this rate to VAT-account holders earning up to EUR65,000 beginning in January 2019. Finally, the administration has approved a new anti-corruption law, as well as a security decree containing a series of tougher policing and immigration measures, and a growth decree intended to jump-start business activity.
The coalition's rhetoric has rattled the markets. The banking sector also remains weak and highly exposed to government debt. However, credit quality has improved rapidly in the past two years, owing to regulatory pressures from the European Central Bank (ECB) to reduce stocks of bad loans on banks' balance sheets, as well as the rescue and restructuring of several troubled lenders.
Nonetheless, an abrupt uptick in market perceptions of political risk could still pose challenges to financial stability. We believe that it is unlikely that Italy will lose market access in 2019-23 (the forecast period). However, owing to the sheer size of Italy's EUR2.3trn public debt stock and the fragility its banks, the economy would be too large to rescue without support from the ECB in the event of a major crisis.

Government debt 132.2 132.5 133.2 132.9 132.3 131.9
On July 1st the government adopted measures intended to reduce the 2019 budget deficit by EUR7.6bn, to 2% of GDP, compared with a previous target of 2.4%. The EUR7.6bn correction includes an adjustment of EUR6.1bn contained in the "budget-balancing" law, comprising EUR6.2bn from higher than projected revenue, as well as a net spending overshoot of EUR100m. The government has also introduced a decree to freeze EUR1.5bn (0.08% of GDP) in unused budget funds that was earmarked to cover the cost of relaxing the 2011 reform of early pension requirements and the citizenship income-the administration's ambitious plan to fight poverty.
Given the distinct risk of higher outlays than expected, The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that this objective is implausible and expects a budget shortfall of 2.5% of GDP in 2019. The 2020 budget process, which will begin with an update to the government's fiscal and economic projections in late September, and the submission of a draft budgetary plan to the European Commission in mid-October, is likely to prove to be exceptionally difficult. The deficit is then expected to expand further, to 2.8% of GDP in 2020, and to an average of about 2.6% in 2021-23. Public debt, at 132.2% of GDP at end-2018, is expected to remain near this level for the next five years.

The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below in order to raise inflation back to its target of "below, but close to, 2%". The ECB also ran a EUR2.6trn quantitative easing (QE) programme in 2015-18.
We have changed our monetary policy call and now believe that a 10-basis-point cut to the deposit rate will come in September (we previously expected a rise in June 2020). This change is underpinned by persistently low inflation, the recent de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations from the target, our subdued outlook for US-China trade relations and the ECB's recent dovish communication. At its latest meeting, on June 6th, the bank delayed the next rate rise from early 2020 until mid-2020 at the earliest (we do not expect this until mid-2021), and strongly signalled its easing bias. A few weeks later Mario Draghi, the ECB president, announced that further stimulus would be forthcoming "in the absence of improvement", rather than only "if contingencies materialise". Funding conditions will therefore remain ultra-loose over the medium term. The ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening, and a third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III) will begin in September. We do not expect the ECB to restart its QE programme this year; we believe that this would be politically and legally too challenging given the current state of the economy, with labour markets proving resilient and the risk of a recession low. Nevertheless, resuming QE remains a possibility, especially if the risk of deflation rises. The nomination of Christine Lagarde, the IMF director, for the ECB presidency is unlikely to lead to a significant change in the ECB's monetary policy strategy.

In full-year 2018 real GDP expanded by 0.7%, down from 1.8% in 2017. Momentum was weak going into 2019, dampened by domestic political and economic uncertainty, as well as global trade tensions. In January-March 2019 the economy expanded by 0.1% (compared with the previous three months). This followed two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and resulted in a first-quarter contraction of 0.1% year on year. We expect that the economy will expand by a marginal 0.1% in full-year 2019, on the back of slower growth in private consumption and fixed investment, and less favourable external conditions. High-frequency indicators for the first half of 2019 paint a mixed picture, suggesting that the recovery from recession is fragile and could falter in the coming quarters.
Economic growth will remain subdued in 2020, at 0.4%. In that year the building effects of the ongoing US-China trade dispute, and weaker growth in the US, will weigh on the external sector and dampen sentiment. Growth should then pick up to an average of 1.1% per year in real terms in 2021-23 as domestic and global demand recover.
The boost to real household disposable income from recent tax cuts has faded, with real private consumption-accounting for about 60% of GDP-growing only modestly, by 0.6% in full-year 2018. Consumer spending also weakened as a result of heightened volatility in financial markets in the final two quarters of 2018, which weighed on consumer confidence, and it may wane in the second half of this year as political tensions with EU institutions mount. We expect weak job creation, modest wage growth and waning consumer confidence to continue to constrain household spending in 2019. After meagre expansions of 0.4% per year on average in 2019-20, we forecast that consumer spending will rise to about 1% per year in 2021-23 as domestic sentiment improves.
Public consumption rose by 0.2% in 2018, and we expect looser spending controls and limited fiscal stimulus efforts to result in a slight uptick in 2019-23. It will remain modest, however, at an annual average rate of 0.5% throughout this period. The current administration's looser stance towards deficit spending will raise the risk of higher levels of government consumption.
Fixed investment expanded for the fourth consecutive year in 2018, but was still more than a fifth less than its 2007 pre-crisis level. It rose by 3.2% in real terms last year, driven by transport-equipment spending in the first half of the year, as well as a slow recovery in construction. In 2019-20 investment growth will slow significantly, to an annual average of 1.2%, held back by the expiration of tax incentives, policy uncertainty and declining sentiment, as well as public capital spending constraints, still impaired credit channels and relatively high levels of corporate debt.
The pace of export growth decreased markedly in 2018, to 1.4%. Export growth is expected to remain weak in 2019-20, owing in particular to weaker growth in EU markets and global trade tensions, before picking up thereafter. Anaemic domestic demand growth and external demand constraints will also limit import growth to less than 2% in 2019-22, before stronger export performance and healthier domestic demand lead to firmer expansion in 2023.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Reflecting the severe impact on the industrial sector of the 2008-o9 global crisis and the subsequent ongoing euro area crisis, industry (excluding construction) accounted for 21.9% of employment in 2019, slightly up from 21.8% in 2007, and 24.1% of nominal gross value added, compared with 20.5% of gross value added in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially Italy's family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, and the uncertainties arising from the euro zone crisis and domestic political risk. Concerns about the global economic outlook stem from the ongoing trade war between the US and China, and rising trade tensions between the EU and the US.
Italian industry faces major challenges owing to structural deficiencies
In 2018 manufacturing accounted for 16.7% of gross value added, down from 17.8% in 2007 and 20.3% in 1997. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Unit labour costs have remained well above the euro area average since 2005 and have continued to rise in Italy since 2010, whereas they have fallen in other peripheral euro area economies such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP-almost a quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services.
After declining in 2008-13, vehicle production in Italy picked up by 6% in 2014 and 45% in 2015, and slowed to 8.8% in 2016, 3.5% in 2017 and -7.2% in 2018. At 1.1m units, annual production is approaching 2007 levels. The fall in 2008-13 reflected the impact of the global economic crisis on demand in Italy and in export markets, as well as the transfer of production to lower-cost countries. A recovery in domestic and external demand drove the rise in output in 2014, whereas the double-digit increase in 2015 was largely driven by the addition of two new models to the FCA's production line at the Melfi factory in southern Italy. The drop in Italian production affected passenger-car output disproportionately. In 2013 passenger-car output was more than 70% lower than in 2000. Following a modest increase of 3% in 2014, Italian passenger-car production rose by 65% in 2015, before moderating to 7.5% in 2016 and 4.2% in 2017, and then contracting sharply, by 9.7%, in 2018.
Passenger-car production and sales suffered last year, mainly owing to the introduction of new EU emissions standards that distorted industry statistics. We forecast that growth will remain sluggish, averaging about 1.7% in 2019-22 and contracting slightly in 2020 as a result of a slowdown in economic activity linked to a cyclical cooling in the US. Commercial vehicle sales will expand more briskly in 2018, by 5.5%, following a modest contraction in 2017 after strong growth of 49% year on year in 2016. In 2019-23 commercial vehicle sales will also slow, to an average annual expansion of 1.6%, as small declines are expected in 2019 and 2020.
Fiat will face challenges in the wake of Sergio Marchionne's departure
Fiat's strategy to become a major global producer through mergers, acquisitions and alliances abroad is proving challenging and will probably not boost production in Italy, even if it is successful. The company has succeeded in raising margins globally, but has set ambitious targets through to 2022, which will be all the more difficult to fulfil following the sudden departure and death of Sergio Marchionne, the firm's iconic chief executive officer since 2004, in late July 2018. Given Italy's high labour costs and other difficulties of doing business in the country, the recent trend of shifting automotive production out of Italy is likely to continue, despite FCA's repeated promise to increase domestic production. Fiat now produces about two-thirds of its vehicles abroad, in China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Serbia, Poland and elsewhere. It closed its Termini Imerese plant in Sicily at the end of 2011 and began producing cars at a new plant in Serbia in the first half of 2012. Integration with Chrysler could also result in more production being transferred to plants outside Italy. Following an agreement with the trade unions to introduce more flexible working practices, and boost productivity and output at its plant at Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples, the company transferred production of one of its models from Poland at the beginning of 2012. However, production at the plant was interrupted or reduced at various times during the economic crisis, when demand in the Italian and wider European car markets contracted.
Manufacturing sector performance will depend on the speed of the reforms
In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities, which has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation and research and development (R&D) has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often aggregated within sector-specific industrial districts, which, through a combination of co-operation and competition, help to mitigate the impact of the difficulties arising from a lack of expansion. According to the Edison Foundation, a think-tank that monitors 99 industrial districts, exports from these districts fell sharply in euro terms in 2009, but have risen strongly since the beginning of 2010, and previously marginal hi-technology districts have increased their weighting in the index as they have outperformed the overall index and Italy's traditional low-tech manufacturing sectors such as clothing and textiles, and home furniture.
Italian SMEs have begun to consolidate under the pressure of intense competition and the global crisis. However, the availability of domestic funds to support mergers or recapitalisations to start new projects is likely to be curtailed by the need to reduce the government debt burden. This has contributed to a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands being acquired by foreign companies in recent years, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors. Global designer brands such as Bulgari, Valentino and Lora Piana have been sold to foreign groups, and as of mid­2014 Indesit, Italy's main manufacturer of white goods, is no longer majority Italian owned. This trend is likely to continue during the forecast period.
Construction sector activity is likely to remain subdued in 2020
Activity in the construction sector accounted for 4.7% of gross value added in 2018-down marginally from 2016, but well below an annual average of 6% of gross value added in 2006-09-and 6.2% of employment in 2016, compared with 8.6% in 2007. After nine full-year contractions, which left output in the sector about a third below its 2006 peak in real terms, the decline appeared to bottom out in the final quarter of 2014, but activity is likely to remain subdued during the forecast period, reflecting the impact of an eight-year decline in property prices up to 2016. On the EU's harmonised measure, house prices began to fall once again on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of that year, and in January-March 2019, Italy was one of only three countries included in the index where house prices were still decreasing. This will weigh on the construction recovery, as will ongoing corruption investigations involving public works contracts, and large government spending cuts are also likely to dampen activity. Various governments have sought to accelerate EU co-financed infrastructure investment plans to provide some support to the sector, but little progress is likely to be made, largely owing to delays at the regional and ministerial levels.
The government will not enact wide-ranging liberalisations
Already accounting for almost 74% of gross value added, the services sector is expected to expand broadly in line with subdued average real GDP growth during the forecast period. Those subsectors that are exposed to foreign competition, such as tourism, are likely to struggle, although security concerns in several competitor markets could help. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition, such as the professions and retailing, will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. Over the near term, the M5S-Lega government is unlikely to embark on ambitious service-sector liberalisations and would be more likely to introduce protective legislation. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, which are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotives, Italy's main export sectors, should continue to perform well, even though in some sectors production is increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are lower.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 34.1 32.9 34.7 36.2 37.8 38.5
Consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2018, at 1.2%, as a 0.2% decline in core inflation (headline inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices) more than offset inflationary pressures that stemmed from a 30.7% increase in international oil prices and a rise in global food prices for the first time in seven years.
In 2019 consumer price growth should slow further, to 0.9%, owing to cheaper average global energy prices and still considerable slack in the labour market, meaning that upward pressure on prices from capacity constraints will not materialise in the near term. A positive demand shock from fiscal policy also appears unlikely. In 2020 headline inflation should increase slightly, driven by a forecast 4.8% increase in global food prices, which will offset downward pressures deriving from declining global energy prices. From 2020 inflation should recover gradually, to average 1.4% in 2021-23, as global energy prices rise.

The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of QE tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, partly owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, mostly hovering around US$1.11:EUR1-US$1.13:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weak euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable in the coming months and to average US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019. Next year it will appreciate to an average of US$1.18:EUR1 as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) further eases policy. The euro should recover more pronouncedly from 2021 on the back of the ECB's policy tightening as growth in the region accelerates, which, together with the euro zone's large current-account surplus, should lift it to US$1.25:EUR1 by end-2023.

In 2018 the current account remained firmly in surplus, at 2.4% of GDP. We expect it to average 1.4% in 2019-23. This decline reflects considerably slower growth in export revenue until 2021, in line with slower global demand. Higher international energy prices in 2021-23 will have a negative effect on the trade balance in those years (Italy is a major energy importer).
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy
Stocks and flows
Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows to Italy picked up to US$34.4bn in 2011 (1.5% of GDP), from about US$10bn (0.5% of GDP) in 2010, but declined again to close to zero in 2012, owing to large disinvestments. Net inflows recovered moderately in 2013-15, averaging US$17.5bn per year (0.9% of GDP). Inward FDI rose to US$31bn in 2018 (equivalent to 1.5% of GDP), up from US$9bn in 2017. Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$550bn in 2018, compared with about US$865bn in France, and about a third of total FDI in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. In relation to GDP, the stock of FDI was 26.5% in 2018, compared with 22.9% in 2014-lower than in any other EU country apart from Greece. FDI outflows have also generally been quite small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy. In 2005-09 Italy recorded substantial outward FDI flows as a result of several major investments abroad in the banking and energy sectors. A similarly large outflow, of about US$52bn, was recorded in 2011, the year that Italian car manufacturer Fiat bought the US Treasury's remaining stake in Chrysler.
Origin and distribution
FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan for about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value-added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2016, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from Luxembourg (EUR64.5bn), France (EUR60bn), the UK (EUR43bn) and Germany (EUR28bn).
Determinants
The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$40,3oo at purchasing power parity (PPP). Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted classical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-technology investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact
According to the Italian Trade and Investment Agency (ITA), foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and half times more in research and development (R&D) than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central Italy and the north in GDP per head terms (less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times higher than that in the north.
Potential
The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period (2019-23) will be hampered by the uncertainty caused by the euro zone crisis and the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. The Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega administration has also signalled a less friendly policy stance towards foreign investment, marginally tightening labour contract regulations through its so-called Dignity Decree, definitively approved in August 2018, and enforcing penalties on foreign firms that take advantage of government investment incentives and then divest or relocate production to other markets. Over the forecast period a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's need to reduce its dependence on imported energy, there could be potential for investment in the still state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources, following the decision in mid-2011 to abandon plans to return to nuclear-power generation. Under the M5S-Lega government, which has taken an economic nationalist approach to policymaking, political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature. M5S, which has taken strong environmental stances in the past, may also use potential ecological consequences as a justification for limiting inward investment, particularly in infrastructure or energy projects. Banking sector reforms may increase opportunities for foreign investment in smaller Italian banks, but there appears to be limited interest at present.

Population growth is projected to come to a virtual halt
Having declined for several years in the late 1990s, Italy's total population increased moderately in 1999-2013, rising by an average of 0.4% per year. Since then the population has increased only marginally, to 60.6m in 2018, according to the UN's population estimates. The meagre increase was mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population, which has almost outpaced immigration. We expect the population to fall in the long term, as the expectation of scarce job opportunities due to the weakness of the economy has probably reduced the influx of immigrants and driven further emigration of young Italians. The Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government's tough stance on immigration may further discourage foreigners from settling in Italy. Since the EU's March 2016 agreement with Turkey, the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece and on to northern Europe has more or less ceased, but this has coincided with a sharp increase in migrant flows to Italy. Migrant inflows fell sharply in 2018. This is partly due to stepped-up collaboration with the Libyan authorities, but also to the inflexible stance of the M5S-Lega administration and of the Maltese authorities, which appears to be deterring migrant vessels from seeking to cross the central Mediterranean. In the past most migrants arriving in Italy moved on to other EU countries, notably Germany.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population has increased steadily in recent years, from 4.5% in 2005 to 8% at end-2013 and 8.7% at end-2018. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for more than 10% of the population at end-2018. However, growth in the number of foreign nationals residing in the south has begun to outpace that in the north and the centre in recent years. The three largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians and Moroccans, who together account for about 40% of the total number of foreign residents. Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market.
Although almost 70% of Italians live in urban areas, the population is widely dispersed among numerous small cities and towns. As a result, local markets tend to be diffused and relatively small in scale.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility
The steady rise in the employment rate (the percentage of people aged 20-64 in employment) since the mid-1990s came to a halt in 2008. At 62.3% in 2016-just below the 62.9% employment rate in 2008-according to Eurostat, it was 10 percentage points lower than the EU28 average and the third-lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 aim to address some of these issues gradually during the forecast period (2019-23). In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will be attributable to greater female participation as well as pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement.
The rise in the proportion of the elderly will put pressure on pensions and healthcare
During the forecast period the number of people of working age will be considerably lower than the number of people reaching 65. As a result, Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) will rise further. At an estimated 39.2% in 2018, it is the highest in the EU, and will continue to rise. This trend, combined with the continued rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending has been on a steadily rising trend and is among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP. According to figures from the Ministry of the Economy, public pension spending is projected to decline gradually over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% in 2013-14, owing to a series of reforms introduced since the beginning of the 1990s. This trend could slow marginally, however, if the M5S-Lega government takes further measures to undo the 2011 Fornero pension reform, the most recent effort to improve the social security system's sustainability.

Italy is a major market, but growth potential remains limited
Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of just over 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
In 2015 the economy began to emerge from a protracted recession. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the recovery to continue during the forecast period (2019-23) but domestic demand growth will remain subdued, given high unemployment, weak business investment, the ongoing need for fiscal consolidation in Italy, high taxation and moderate wage growth.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU28 average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at US$39,041 in 2016 and an estimated US$41,486 last year. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 46% of that in the north. Development policies in the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 18%-just above the level in France, but significantly above that in the Netherlands (about 15%), Germany (13.9%) and the UK (12%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period, largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low, and interest rates on consumer loans have declined and are expected to rise only moderately in 2019-23, containing the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Still, we expect only moderately stronger demand for big-ticket items and branded goods, as consumers are likely to postpone purchases until sentiment improves further and risks to the recovery diminish. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock.
Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market. Growth will be driven by innovations such as smartphones, tablet computers and, more recently, wearable technology. However, weak income growth will dampen demand. Personal computer (PC) access lags well behind countries such as the UK and Germany, where the penetration rate is above 90% of households, and France, where it is about 84%, compared with about 73% in Italy.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending
Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to be introduced in order to meet budgetary targets.
Italians tend to live at home with their parents often until their mid-thirties. Thus, a larger portion of the disposable income of those aged 18-35 has tended to be spent on leisure and consumer goods than in other countries, although this trend is likely to be offset by low salaries for many young people who have work and by one of the highest youth unemployment rates (among the 15-24 age group) in Europe, despite its gradual decline in recent years. In June 2018 it was 32.6%, down from a peak of 43.5% in March 2014-almost double pre-crisis levels in 2007-08.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor in the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. Besides undergoing severe fiscal consolidation during the 1990s in order to join the euro area, which dampened growth in that decade, the Italian economy has suffered from a steady loss of competitiveness owing to low productivity growth and rising unit labour costs (reflecting falling output, despite wage moderation since 1993)-in contrast to the situation in its main trading partners.
The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework policy hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration has denounced the emphasis on structural reforms advocated by the EU and, at least nominally, espoused by previous governments. It may undo some of the meagre progress made in recent years and is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's competitiveness. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment during the recent recession, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Unfavourable demographic trends will weigh on long-term growth
Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration is expected to be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population in the long-term forecast period up to 2050. Italy's labour market participation rate is expected to rise from current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age. However, it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72% in 2018) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 0.7% in 2019-50.
External conditions: The effects of the global crisis of 2008-09 and the height of the euro area crisis in 2010-13 will be felt for years. The risk that the sovereign debt crisis in financially stressed peripheral countries in the euro area, including Italy, will lead to a partial or even complete break-up of the single currency area, which would have severe negative consequences for Italy's long-term economic prospects, has eased, but The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that it is more likely than not that Greece will leave the euro area during our medium-term forecast period. Even without Greece in the euro area, the euro zone member states are still a long way from resolving the structural shortcomings of the single currency area, and the rhetoric of the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government risks provoking instances of market volatility.
The rhetoric of the government risks provoking instances of market volatility
Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. In the past, clusters of family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies located in the so­called industrial districts in the north and centre of the country showed greater flexibility and ability to adapt to changing external conditions than Italy's few large companies. However, more recently they have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-technology sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D and innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic ''Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower. The reluctance to relinquish control will hinder the expansion of family-owned businesses, which also often face difficult choices in terms of management succession.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow
Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short lived. Some reforms have been introduced since the financial turmoil of late 2011. However, popular and political resistance to reform halted the Renzi government's attempt to overhaul Italy's institutional framework in 2014-16, taking institutional change off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition. The M5S-Lega administration, which campaigned forcefully against the constitutional reform, has no intention of pursuing further institutional changes and will seek to loosen fiscal consolidation marginally and soften recent structural reforms.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. A more comprehensive system of unemployment protection envisaged under the 2012 and 2014 reforms could help to enhance labour mobility, but there may be a lack of resources without more drastic cuts in public spending on pensions, which is projected to ease from a peak of just under 16% of GDP in 2013-14 to just above 15% in 2019, according to the Treasury (before rising again until the late 2040 and falling again sharply thereafter). The M5S-Lega government has vowed to roll back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which could lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth
Long-term performance: Our baseline forecast is that Italian GDP growth will average 0.8% per year in 2019-50, which is considerably weaker than what was until recently considered to be Italy's trend rate of growth (1.5%). The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2017 fell from 107% of the EU28 average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy, and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Climate change is expected to have a moderate, but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, especially among the country's growing elderly population, as well. In 2017 six of 20 Italian regions called on the government to declare a state of emergency owing to water stress. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such as citrus fruits and wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination and a regional capital, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure. This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to show the impact of climate change on long-term growth and we find that the Italian economy will be 1.9% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments
Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0", or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, Cloud technologies, or Big Data analytics. The share rises sharply, from 6% of firms with fewer than ten employees, to about 47% of firms with 250 employees or more. In 2016 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.3% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile the trade balance of high-technology goods stood at -0.54% of GDP in 2015 (latest data available). Since 2016, a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, and higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Thailand--highlights: Political outlook
The government elected in March 2019 will remain aligned to the military junta during its four-year term. It will consist of a 19-party coalition led by the Phalang Pracharat, with the former coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, continuing as prime minister. The military's overarching influence will be ensured by the constitution drafted by the junta in 2016-17, which will lead to policy continuity on major infrastructure and investment reforms. Nonetheless, the presence of a large and vocal opposition, as well as governance through a coalition, will result in more delayed policymaking than was the case under junta rule. Other organised (but non-violent) challenges to the government cannot be ruled out, particularly later in the forecast period.

Thailand's business environment score rises in 2019-23, pushing up its global ranking to 36th, from 41st in 2014-18. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The macroeconomic environment will stabilise, although it will remain vulnerable to external conditions, particularly in the early part of the forecast period. Nonetheless, we expect improvements in policy towards private enterprise and foreign investment, as the new government strives to boost the country's regional competitiveness and to support high-value industries. The overall tax regime will remain stable and accommodative to business, although increases in the minimum wage and capital gains tax are likely later in the forecast period. Trade liberalisation will continue, with growing integration between Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) members and other countries in Asia. Construction will continue on big-ticket infrastructure projects, but will be hindered by the country's skilled labour shortage.
Thailand--highlights: Economic outlook

Real GDP growth (%) 4.1 3.3 2.4 3.7 3.8 3.0

We expect Thailand's real GDP to expand by 3.2% a year on average in 2019-23. The relatively lacklustre performance reflects an easing of external demand in 2019-20, which will hit the country's strategic export-oriented sector. This will be further strained by elevated household debt, which will continue to crimp private consumption. Growth will nonetheless be buoyed by public investment in infrastructure development, expectations of policy continuity and growth in the tourism industry. Later in the forecast period, expansion will be supported further by a pick-up in global demand and the conclusion of several free-trade agreements.

Population growth   0.4 0.2
Working-age population growth   0.2 -0.3
Labour force growth   -0.4 0.1
The rate of population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families. Continued improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to a rising life expectancy and a growing share of the population over 65 years old. The ageing population will nonetheless put a burden on healthcare provision. Migrant labour from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will grow in absolute terms, helped by the development of economic zones at the border. This will serve to boost the labour force in 2019-23, against the trend of a declining domestic workforce.

Thailand is a sizeable market, with a population of 69.6m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$505.3bn (at market exchange rates) in 2018. The retail sector will create market opportunities, due in part to continued growth in the number of both domestic and foreign tourists. In the early part of the forecast period the new government will maintain populist policies for key interest groups in order to support the country's economic performance, but this will do little to address wide income gaps. Household debt will remain a dampener on consumer sentiment in the forecast period. Nonetheless, rising average incomes will support growth in the hospitality, leisure and technology sectors.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Thailand's long-term outlook hinges on the assumption that governments in the next ten years will possess sufficient political power to enact and continue structural reforms and develop infrastructure. Such reforms will improve the business environment and raise productivity. Nonetheless, there will be persistent challenges, owing to fiscal constraints, political tensions and strong regional competition. In later decades Thailand's unfavourable demographic profile and the impact of climate change will also start to reveal a significant, negative impact on GDP growth and political stability.

Background: Following a revolution in 1932, Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy. While the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent; there have been 19 coups since 1932. The last coup took place in 2014, when the democratically elected government led by Yingluck Shinawatra was removed following months of political turmoil, in a fate similar to that which befell her older brother and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2006. Thailand returned to a limited form of democracy in 2019. Although orderly elections were held, a constitution effectively designed by the junta ensured that a military-aligned party, the Phalang Pracharat, assumed power (at the head of a coalition).
Political structure: Following the recent transition from junta administration to nominally civilian government, parliament takes the form of a 750-seat National Assembly, consisting of an elected 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house) and a 250-seat Senate (upper house) that was appointed by the NCPO. The prime minister is appointed by the National Assembly, and the king, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, remains the symbolic head of state.
Policy issues: The new military-aligned government will continue to focus on improving the investment environment. It will pursue the public-investment drive in infrastructure initiated by the junta in an effort to boost the country's long-term economic performance. The military's focus on long-term policy continuity will reassure many foreign investors deterred by potential political instability, but growing regional competition will detract from Thailand's attractiveness as an investment destination. Governance through a 19-party coalition, as well as the presence of a large and vocal opposition, will also result in delays and gridlock on legislative issues not mandated in the junta-drafted constitution.
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stockmarket. Value-added tax (VAT) stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$150,000).
Foreign trade: Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (fob-fob) of US$22.3bn in 2018, down from US$34.2bn in 2017. As a result, the current-account surplus stood at US$35.2bn in 2018, down from its 2017 level of US$50.2bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
A military-aligned government assumed power in July 2019 following the national legislative election held in March. The government consists of a 19-party coalition led by the Phalang Pracharat, with a former general and coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, as prime minister. The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO, the military junta) ruled Thailand following the military coup of 2014 and continues to exercise influence on public affairs through a constitution drafted by its members in 2016-17. The legislature comprises a 250-seat Senate (upper house) appointed by the NCPO and endorsed by the king, and a 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house), elected democratically. These features will incline future regimes to be aligned with the junta's preferences. Nonetheless, the military's grip is weakened by the fact that the Phalang Pracharat governs in a coalition and the lower house includes a large and vocal opposition (led by Puea Thai, the party of two former prime ministers-and siblings-Yingluck and Thaksin Shinawatra, and the newly formed Future Forward Party). We expect the government to complete its four year term.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who was formally crowned in May 2019, will oversee stability in the monarchy. Although the king will remain removed from day-to-day politics, he will adopt a more centralised style of leadership than that adopted by his revered late father. Later in the forecast period, the military will look to the monarchy to legitimise its own political role. This will result in a greater intertwining of royal and military networks as the country navigates a return to quasi-civilian rule. Nonetheless, the king's prominent place in Thai society will diminish in coming years, as the new monarch fails to command the same level of reverence among the public that his father did.

Political outlook: Political stability
Although junta rule formally came to an end in mid-July, the military will retain a dominant influence over government in 2019-23. National legislative elections held in March under a new electoral system, which was in effect designed by the junta, resulted in a government led by the military-aligned Phalang Pracharat party, under the prime ministership of the coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha. The military establishment's control over government will be further assured by an entirely junta-appointed Senate (upper house) and a ministerial cabinet that retains several former military generals in key posts.
The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that political stability will be maintained in the short term. This will be largely because of the continued participation of opposition parties in the political process. Voter turnout for the election, at nearly 75%, was high, and the opposition gained a sizeable share of seats in the House of Representatives (the lower house). These factors will incline anti-coup forces to respect the results of the election in the medium term, and help to prevent large-scale public unrest.
Later in the forecast period, the risk of parties boycotting the formal political process and leading protests against the military-dominated government will rise as it becomes clear that even a sizeable parliamentary opposition cannot push through many of its preferred policies. Under this scenario, the military could revert to total control of government, with basic public order preserved via its command over the security forces.
The rule of King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who was formally crowned in May 2019 after two years on the throne, will have a minimal impact on political stability in 2019-23. The military establishment depends on royal endorsement for much of its political legitimacy. It has therefore ensured the continuance of the monarchy in line with the wishes of the late king and has proactively suppressed criticism of the new monarch via lese-majesty laws. This will continue under the next administration.
King Maha has sought to consolidate his position in the political sphere by customising rules concerning the delegation of the monarch's authority and control over the royal estate. However, royal intrusion into everyday politics will remain rare. Indeed, many of the changes were aimed at ensuring that the king could continue to reside outside the country for long periods without having to delegate his powers. The king's decision to block the prime-ministerial candidacy of his sister, Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, in early 2019 also reflects a commitment to remaining removed from parliamentary politics.
The insurgency in the Muslim-dominated southern provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat will continue. It will consist of small-scale attacks against the security forces and-occasionally-religious sites frequented by civilians. However, the insurgency presents only a minimal threat to overall political stability-the possibility of the insurgency spreading to other parts of the country remains low. We therefore do not expect the situation to trigger public unrest or threaten the tourism sector in 2019-23.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness will be underpinned by policy continuity under the military-aligned government, as well as broad respect for the junta-drafted constitution of 2016-17. In particular, the Phalang Pracharat's ability to pass and implement legislation will be supported by the constitutionally mandated 20-year "National Strategy"-a blueprint for development devised by the junta. Although the party will govern in alliance with 18 other parties, support on most issues (and especially those related to infrastructure and investment) will be guaranteed by the fact that the majority of party leaders are loyalists keen to remain in power. Nonetheless, occasional disagreements will emerge within the coalition, such as on the issue and scope of constitutional amendments. This will lead to a more delayed and negotiated form of policymaking than was the case under the junta's unilateral rule.
More significant threats to government effectiveness will arise from the vocal opposition, which has vehemently criticised the military's continued grip on power. Dissent will probably be voiced by prominent parties such as the Future Forward Party and Puea Thai, focusing largely on policy specifics and matters not mandated in the National Strategy. Issues such as income inequality, political accountability, military spending and the oversight of infrastructure projects will feature prominently on the opposition's agenda for scrutiny. This will lead to instances of legislative gridlock and stymied policymaking.
Nonetheless, the Phalang Pracharat will devote significant resources to populist policies, to appease interest groups such as agricultural producers, while simultaneously pursuing a pro-business push. Avoiding the creation of future political tensions will remain a key underlying priority. The junta did not make significant progress in reconciling the political differences between the rural population of the north (who supported Thaksin) and the elite in southern Thailand (who are represented by his detractors, the current establishment). The military-aligned government will thus continue to find it difficult to satisfy the two major camps and may face rising opposition from one or both in the medium term-the same tensions that have plagued its predecessors.
Corruption will remain a significant problem in many of the country's institutions, including the military. Cases under the new government involving unelected officials, particularly those with explicit military links, may serve as a flashpoint for discontent over the new constitutional system and its lack of accountability. If open discontent does materialise, it is more likely to be the result of a cumulative series of incidents and thus to occur later in the forecast period. Although the new administration will make efforts to show a tougher stance against corruption, for instance by encouraging use of a dedicated court, these measures will be pursued selectively in accordance with political influence. Given the slow progress of similar initiatives under previous military-aligned governments, there is little reason to believe that the new administration will be any more successful in clamping down on corrupt activities.
Political outlook: Election watch
National polls for the 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house) were held on March 24th 2019. The military-aligned Phalang Pracharat secured 116 seats (97 constituency seats and 19 party-list seats). This compared with 136 seats won by the Puea Thai party of former prime ministers Yingluck and Thaksin Shinawatra, and 81 seats won by the newly formed Future Forward Party under the leadership of Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.
Despite obtaining a minority in the lower house, Phalang Pracharat forged an alliance with 18 parties, including the prominent Bhumjaithai and Democrat parties, to secure 254 of the total 500 seats in the lower house. In combination with the junta-appointed 250-seat Senate (upper house), this allowed the appointment of Prayuth, the junta's preferred candidate for prime minister, on June 5th. The next national elections are due in 2023.
Political outlook: International relations
We expect a swift and full normalisation of Thailand's ties with Western governments under the new government, despite the significant influence that the military will retain in public affairs. This normalisation will include the resumption of talks on an EU-Thailand free-trade agreement (FTA). Indeed, many Western countries that had severed links with Thailand after the coup in 2014 partially restored relations during the junta's rule for the sake of economic ties and in response to wider concerns about China's political influence in the region. Prayuth met the heads of state of the US, UK and France prior to the elections, and relations with these countries should deepen with a return to a democratic government. Meanwhile, Japan preserved most diplomatic engagement, including bilateral FTA negotiations, during the junta's rule. This reflects that country's concern that its economic influence in Thailand may be overtaken as Chinese investment in the country rises. This, as well as a relocation of Japanese firms to Thailand amid US-China trade tensions, should lead to a strengthening of Thailand-Japan economic ties between Thailand and Japan in 2019-23.
Nevertheless, China's influence in Thailand will also continue to grow in 2019-23. Crucially, the two countries have no conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea and are important trading partners. Economic ties are set to strengthen further as Thailand focuses on forging bilateral deals with Chinese state-owned enterprises under its public investment drive. A public backlash against projects under this remit-similar to those that have been emerging recently in some other countries engaged in projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative-is unlikely, as the Thai government has negotiated more favourable terms on key projects. However, this approach has created its own setbacks, as illustrated by the stop-start progress of the planned China-Laos-Thailand high-speed rail project. Such tussles will continue to delay the economic benefits of greater regional integration.
Increasing bilateral co-operation with China is unlikely to obstruct Thailand's ongoing efforts to engage with its neighbours in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). This is in part because tensions between other ASEAN members and China in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea will remain subdued for much of the forecast period. This will allow Thailand to strengthen relations with ASEAN neighbours Cambodia and Myanmar through increased economic co-operation.

The macroeconomic environment will stabilise in the forecast period, although it will remain vulnerable to external conditions. An improvement in the scores for policy towards private enterprise and competition and policy towards foreign investment under an elected government will encourage a moderate rise in investment. Some relocation of supply chains to Thailand, amid regional trade tensions, will also provide a modest boost to manufacturing activity. This will be aided by an open capital account and a relatively stable currency.
However, lacklustre domestic demand will remain a major drag on business sentiment, with high household debt weighing on private consumption prospects. The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) will remain independent and monetary policy will be fairly conservative. Ambitious transport infrastructure projects boost the score for infrastructure by the largest increment of all the categories, as a drive to make comprehensive improvements to the country's connectivity gets under way.

Business environment outlook: Thailand's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The authorities reorganise the management of several state-owned enterprises but do not sell off significant assets.
2021-23: Thailand improves its domestic intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement regime, which leads to the country's removal from the US Trade Representative's IPR watchlist.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The opposition's demands for greater oversight of infrastructure projects improve the quality of investment, despite occasional project delays.
2021-23: Opposition to the sale of assets to foreigners persists, particularly in the utilities sector. The authorities introduce new incentives to promote inward investment in targeted industries while removing incentives in low-value-added sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Administrative procedures for trade transactions with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are streamlined amid efforts to step up the integration of the ASEAN Economic Community.
2021-23: Negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement between ASEAN and Japan, Australia, China, India, New Zealand and South Korea enter their final stages.
Taxes
2019-20: New land and property taxes are enforced, but commercial rates remain low. Income tax is reduced for low-income households in order to support consumption and address inequality.
2021-23: Mandatory social-security payments for employers rise from 3% to 5%. The government raises the rate of value-added tax (VAT) slightly from its current level of 7%.
Financing
2019-20: Access to business financing benefits from the continued development of the local bond and equity markets.
2021-23: Commercial banks based in other ASEAN countries begin to offer retail services in Thailand under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework.
The labour market
2019-20: A clampdown on unregistered migrants affects the availability of low-skilled labour in the short term. The minimum wage is raised gradually in industries that are able to absorb cost pressures.
2021-23: Shortages of skilled labour become more acute, driving up costs in high-value-added industries. The government loosens immigration controls on skilled foreign workers.
Infrastructure
2019-20: The expansion of road and rail infrastructure progresses slowly, providing a boost to the construction sector.
2021-23: Expansion programmes are completed at Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi international airports in Bangkok.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The government implements regulations related to data privacy, electronic transactions and cybersecurity.
2021-23: The Board of Investment continues to prioritise projects under the ten sectors listed within the "Thailand 4.0" plan.

There will be a slight improvement in Thailand's macroeconomic environment score during the forecast period, which will lead to a jump in the country's global and regional rankings: relatively low public debt, a firmly positive current-account balance and fairly stable fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policies will underpin macroeconomic stability. Economic expansion will remain in line with the pace achieved in recent years, averaging 3.2% in 2019-23, compared with 3.1% in 2014-18. Growth will slump to a multi-year low of 2.4% in 2020, owing to muted private consumption growth and a slowdown in the US economy, a key trading partner. External and domestic demand will pick up in the later part of the forecast period, but growing competition with peers in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will keep a lid on growth.
Economic stability will improve gradually during the forecast period
The military's direct grip on economic affairs will loosen in 2019-23, leading to gradual implementation and approval of major spending plans. Nonetheless, adherence to the constitutionally mandated "National Strategy", the junta's 20-year blueprint for development, will underpin continuity in major infrastructure projects and demand-side stimulatory measures. This will ensure that business-oriented tax reform and investment incentives are maintained and expanded in 2019-23, and that major infrastructure investment projects continue beyond this period. In the early part of the forecast period, the export-dependent economy will remain vulnerable to external headwinds, which will weaken growth. Nonetheless, broad economic stability will be ensured by sound macroeconomic fundamentals, including a large current-account surplus and manageable levels of public debt. This will be helped by a recovery in growth in 2021-22, as global economic conditions improve.
The BOT will also remain independent and credible in its regulation of the financial sector and management of the economy. The central bank governor, Veerathai Santiprabhob, who took the reins in October 2015, is well respected and likely to be appointed for a second term in 2020. This will ensure that the BOT remains relatively free from political pressure in setting policy rates and managing excess volatility of the local currency, the baht.
The local currency has appreciated gradually against the US dollar since 2016, mirroring an increase in the current-account surplus and foreign-exchange reserves. We expect the baht to stabilise from 2020 as macroeconomic fundamentals strengthen. The BOT will intervene to prevent a strengthening baht by tightening foreign-exchange monitoring and implementing measures to curb hot-money inflows. This will be partly motivated by a preference for a weaker currency to aid exporters.

We expect a significant improvement in the score for policy towards private enterprise and competition as the government makes more aggressive efforts to attract investment. This will help Thailand's global ranking to improve from 35th in 2014-18 to 26th in 2019-23. However, the country's regional ranking will remain unchanged owing to concurrent improvements in other Asian countries. Corruption and favouritism continue to hinder free-market dynamics, despite the growing prominence of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) in recent years. The political elite retains a disproportionate influence on commercial affairs: individuals with ties to military leaders and the traditional establishment tend to extract concessions from government and influence legal judgments. Nonetheless, the return to a quasi-civilian regime should lead to a modest improvement in government accountability.
Privatisation of SOEs will proceed at a sluggish pace
Reforms to bolster the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been proposed in recent years, but have yet to be implemented. Privatisation remains a sensitive issue among both powerful interests and the public. It is unlikely that the military-aligned government will sell off lucrative state assets, as this would redistribute economic rents away from current holders. A long-standing area of concern is the lack of protection for intellectual property (IP): legal provisions are in place to control piracy of digital and online content, but enforcement is poor, even by regional standards. The government will continue to use price controls for some basic goods to keep them affordable; prices for goods on the "sensitive" list cannot be changed without the permission of the Ministry of Commerce.
The reform of corporate governance at 56 SOEs, controlling assets worth over US$300bn, will continue, albeit at a slow and uneven pace. The government will probably assign low priority to SOE reform in the early part of the forecast period, although the broad mandate will remain part of the junta-developed, constitutionally binding 20-year National Strategy. Later, we expect the passage of legislation to restructure SOEs and reform key parts of business processes, which was first introduced in 2017. This will expand and improve procurement processes, which will help to increase transparency, reduce corruption and boost competition in the public-private sphere. Meanwhile, "superboards" devised under the junta regime-to address public-sector corruption and oversee reform-will remain prone to political influence.
Thailand has been on the US Trade Representative's lower-priority Watch List for intellectual property since late 2017. While the country has made progress on matters related to patents and copyright legislation in recent years, instances of IP infringement remain relatively frequent. This is due to a combination of legislative and enforcement issues, such as the country's non-compliance with the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Copyright Treaty, a limited level of punitive measures and patent application backlogs. We expect weakness in this regard to slow the country's progress towards becoming a "digital economy" and to act as a disincentive to foreign brands looking to do business in Thailand.

The score for policy towards foreign investment will improve moderately in 2019-23, compared with the historical period, raising both the country's regional and global rankings. Thailand will continue to encourage inward investment, especially in higher-value-added industries, as part of the "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy. Further incentives are almost certain to be rolled out in 2019-23 and the BOI will continue to fast-track investment approvals. The government will also not revive proposals to amend the Foreign Business Act, which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to control Thai entities unless they own a majority of shares.
The BOI's investment promotion strategy for 2015-22 offers incentives and government support for foreign investors. The strategy's current focus is on advancing the use of technology, enhancing productivity and strengthening human capital, particularly in advanced, high-technology industries. It also focuses on the development of target areas by offering incentives to set up businesses in less developed parts of the country and promoting ten special economic zones (SEZs) along the land borders of Thailand and its neighbours. The latter are in place to take advantage of increasing international labour flows under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which was formally established in 2015. Incentives in the ten SEZs include corporate income tax breaks in certain industries. These objectives dovetail with the longer-term Thailand 4.0 policy.
Incentives offered to foreign investment will increase
In addition to the ten border SEZs under development, a large coastal-situated economic zone in the form of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) has also been designated, capitalising on an existing industrial belt along the eastern seaboard. Incentives for firms operating in the EEC include double tax deductions on some utilities for a ten-year period; access to cheap credit; and the ability to use unskilled foreign labour from neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, the EEC will benefit from transport infrastructure upgrades linking it more effectively with the capital, Bangkok, and major air- and seaports, in addition to a range of tax and regulatory incentives. The promotion strategy will also introduce industrial developments based around the notion of "super-clusters". These will be collective industry hubs targeting, for instance, the automotive, electrical appliances, chemicals, digital, food production and medical industries. The BOI and the Ministry of Finance will provide tax relief and other incentives related to land ownership and work-permit facilitation. These efforts will be undermined slightly, however, by delays in the implementation of key projects and the below-par prospects for private consumption, which are low by the standards of other countries at Thailand's income level.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls rises in 2019-23, driven by improvements in the country's foreign-trade regime and increased regional integration. This causes Thailand's global ranking to jump from 37th in 2014-18 to 27th in 2019-23. Thailand's reliance on international trade, as well as signs of easing external demand in 2019-20, will ensure that the government maintains a favourable relationship with major export markets in the early part of the forecast period. Authorities will be more likely to accommodate the demands of influential domestic groups in 2021-23, when we expect to see a recovery in external trade conditions. The government will be keen to diversify export markets and to pursue trade agreements, both individually and in partnership with other ASEAN members. The bloc's agreements include those in place with China and India, and a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand. Thailand will also be keen to complete negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), but progress will be slow.
In the meantime, the country will adhere to its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Thailand has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends. The central bank has eased restrictions on outward capital flows, but is likely to impose temporary measures to control capital inflows that pose a risk to macroeconomic stability.
Thailand will continue to liberalise its trade regime in line with its commitment to implementing the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which has already led to a lifting of most import duties on goods from other ASEAN member states. Freer movement of goods, services, investment and skilled labour (in eight selected sectors) between the ten member states came into effect at end-2015, although onerous customs regulations and non-tariff barriers continue to limit intra-regional trade. The share of services trade within ASEAN, which has remained flat in recent years, will grow in 2019-23 owing to the progressive implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA) from October 2019. This will replace the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) and will cushion dwindling exports, increase the transparency in services trade and liberalise key subsectors such as healthcare.
Negotiation on a Thailand-EU FTA will resume
Formal talks on a bilateral free-trade agreement (FTA) between Thailand and the EU were put on hold after the 2014 coup and will probably resume in late 2019. European and Thai businesses are keen to conclude a deal, which would compensate in part for Thailand's loss of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences status in 2015. A Thai-EU deal is unlikely to be implemented before the end of the forecast period. In the interim, Thailand will face growing competition from regional peers such as Vietnam, which signed an FTA with the EU in mid-2019.

Thailand's score in the taxes category improves marginally in 2019-23, but this is not enough to prevent a drop in the country's regional ranking. The minor improvement in the score is due to our expectation that the government will raise value-added tax (VAT) later in the forecast period. Nonetheless, Thailand remains a very competitive territory overall for taxes. The country's tax regime is relatively simple and changes have been made in recent years to reduce the overall burden on households and firms. As a result, its ranking in this area has improved over time (although a relatively low tax/GDP ratio is a fiscal concern in the medium-to-long term). The standard rate of corporate tax was reduced from 30% in 2011 to 20% in 2013. We expect it to remain at 20%, given the government's aim of boosting the country's competitiveness as a destination for foreign investors and to mitigate the impact of higher minimum wage levels. Tax incentives are also widely available, particularly those aimed at drawing foreign investment in strategic, high-value industries. The personal income tax regime is also relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35% for Thai and foreign workers with annual earnings over Bt5m (US$145,000). A cut in income tax for lower income thresholds is likely to be sanctioned in 2020, to support private consumption and gain populist support.
The VAT rate will be raised slightly towards the end of the forecast period
The junta repeatedly postponed an increase in the standard VAT rate in 2014-18. The government stated that it would maintain the rate at 7% until end-September 2019, although we expect this to be extended into 2020. The authorities will raise the rate in 2021-23 as they consolidate the public finances after private consumption returns to a stronger footing. This decision will also be influenced by calls from international organisations such as the IMF to push the rate back up. These calls will ensure that the VAT rate is not lowered earlier in the forecast period, despite calls from coalition parties such as the Bhum Jai Thai.
With changes to consumption taxes off the agenda in the earlier part of the forecast period, the military-aligned government will push for other tax reforms to address inequality and inject fiscal stimulus. This will include the provision of handouts in a bid to support consumption. These sops will range from allowing individuals to deduct income tax on purchases of selected consumer goods to income tax deductions for domestic hotel and travel expenses in particular tax years. Similarly, the government will support the real-estate market through subsidised loans and other targeted incentives, such as income tax deductions for first-time buyers in lower income brackets.
To cushion the fiscal impact of these measures, the government will make efforts to expand revenue collection, partly owing to pressure from the opposition. These will include measures to streamline tax-filing processes, an increase in the sugar tax in October 2019 and the imposition of capital gains tax later in the forecast period. Meanwhile, a property tax on land and building assets, which came into effect in March 2019, will have a minor impact on foreign business; the tax rates most applicable to them will be less than 2%.

Thailand's score for financing will improve in 2019-23, as the banking sector will be in better health. However, improvements in the financing environments of neighbouring countries will result in Thailand's regional ranking for the category remaining unchanged. Similarly, an improvement in countries outside the region will see its global ranking slip to 27th, from 22nd. Increased due diligence and prudential measures among banks helped to ensure that the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans remains relatively low, at 2.9%. This situation is expected to be sustained in 2019-23 as the BOT embarks on measures to tackle poor debt serviceability. This will bolster the overall health of the banking sector, ensuring that the supply of credit to private firms will not be significantly curtailed at any point during the forecast period.
There will be trend towards consolidation in the financial sector
The BOT and the finance ministry will continue to focus on increasing the competitiveness of the financial sector, principally via the consolidation of a number of private- and state-owned financial institutions, in anticipation of banking services liberalisation under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework. Thailand is currently in negotiations with Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar to lower crossborder banking licence restrictions, which will lead to greater competition in the Thai banking sector. Thailand is also pursuing various efforts to reduce transaction costs for local banks, such as by facilitating local currency settlements with the Philippines, linking payment systems with Singapore and incorporating technology -such as quick response (QR) codes-to increase interoperability across markets. We expect the bulk of these financial liberalisation reforms to be implemented between Thailand and its ASEAN neighbours towards the end of the forecast period.
The local bond market will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT. The market has experienced rapid growth in recent years, and is presently ASEAN's largest local-currency bond market. By March 2019 the size of the bond market stood at US$399bn, nearing the stock exchange market capitalisation of US$532bn. Although government bonds continue to dominate the market, at over 70% of all bonds issued, debt-laden large and medium-sized companies are increasingly using the bond market to refinance their bank loans and offshore borrowings. Strengthening demand in this market will continue in the early part of the forecast period.

The deterioration in Thailand's global and regional rankings in the labour market category reflects its waning competitiveness. The country is a labour-scarce economy and unemployment is low. Labour market conditions will, in general, remain adequate in terms of supporting the operations of foreign-invested enterprises, but weaknesses, especially rising wage costs and skill shortages, will persist. The country's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production are diminishing, amid growing competition from neighbouring economies such as Cambodia and Vietnam.
In addition to rising relative costs for low-skilled workers, shortages of labour trained to work in high-value industries pose a growing problem to the government's "Thailand 4.0" policy ambitions, which are premised on developing the country's advanced technology sectors. These skilled labour problems stem in large part from Thailand's underperforming education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally. Educational reforms in the last two decades have been poorly and inconsistently implemented, and there are currently no plans for a major overhaul of the system. The ability of the labour force to meet the needs of businesses (in terms of specialist skills) is thus likely to remain below global standards. Hiring foreign workers will continue to be relatively difficult and expensive, except for labour from other ASEAN countries in designated sectors. The scope for industrial unrest will remain limited by the country's relative attractiveness as an operating location and the low level of unionisation.
From January 2017 the nationwide daily minimum-wage schedule was replaced by minimum wages per province. The range of the wage floor was raised to Bt308-330 (around US$9) with effect from April 2018. An increase in the minimum wage has been floated by the new government, although it is likely to face opposition in parliament and among business associations owing to the damage it would incur on private sector costs and Thailand's regional competitiveness. Despite this, we expect the government to succeed in raising the minimum wage in 2020-21: this will be done gradually, beginning with industries that have the capacity to absorb inflationary pressure.
The retirement age will rise incrementally in 2019-23
Thailand is facing the social and economic consequences of a rapidly ageing society, including a steadily declining workforce as a share of the total population. The new government will introduce steps to mitigate this crisis towards the end of the forecast period. Proposals advocating a staggered increase in the retirement age of civil servants-from 60 years to 63-will be fully implemented in 2024. When the first increase is sanctioned, which we expect to happen in 2021-22, this will invariably put pressure on private employers to follow suit with a slight increase in the retirement age. This will be insufficient to address wider problems related to an ageing population, such as the need for matching skills and increasing elderly care.
Migrant workers account for over 10% of the total labour force, according to the UN. These workers typically come from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and fill low-skilled vacancies in industries such as agriculture, construction and domestic work. We expect the size of the local labour force to decline in Thailand during the forecast period, with the country becoming more reliant on migrant workers. This will be driven partly by the development of SEZs, which the government has opened in border areas in order to capitalise on the supply of low-cost migrant labour from neighbouring countries. Despite this, we expect structural issues related to the mistreatment of migrant workers to persist. International concern over potential human rights abuses in Thailand, especially in the fishing industry, have resulted in tighter regulation of protective measures for migrant workers, but the UN reports that exploitation still occurs. Occasional progress will be made to strengthen workers' legal rights, partly in collaboration with foreign governments such as Myanmar. Nonetheless, an accompanying crackdown on migrants without proper documentation will stymie the availability of foreign workers at the outset of the forecast period.

Thailand's infrastructure score will experience an improvement in the next five years, although faster developments in neighbouring countries will cause the country's regional ranking to fall from 9th to 10th. The military-aligned government will continue to prioritise long-pending "megaprojects", although these will still face occasional delays. Improvements in telecommunications services have also been slow. Although 4G coverage is widely available, average speeds remain slow by regional comparison. Electricity supplies have risen, but the potential for shortages remains. At present, over 70% of the country's electricity is generated using natural gas, according to the Energy Policy and Planning Office, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices. With gas supplies in the Gulf of Thailand in decline, the government's energy plans prioritise diversification of energy sources and the development of renewable energy. These goals are part of the Power Development Plan 2018, which lays out targets for energy production, consumption and imports from 2018 to 2037.
Many large infrastructure projects will be under way in 2019-23
The government has faced delays in the financing and implementation stages of its ambitious infrastructure development megaprojects owing to issues with land acquisition, environmental impact and commercial viability. This includes the high-speed railway linking Thailand and China, via Laos, which will near completion in 2021 after a decade of start-stop progress. Elsewhere, transport projects have faced delays due to wrangling over financing with Chinese and Japanese investors. This partly reflects the government's efforts to take advantage of the ongoing competition for geopolitical influence between the two countries; the Thai government has been seeking the best deal but has also taken a cautious approach to shifting its alliances, in light of China's growing economic influence and Japan's historical investment links. We expect these dynamics, as well as the return to democratically elected government, to result in uneven progress on priority projects in 2019-23. This is in large part because the government will no longer be able to use unilateral executive powers to fast-track priority projects, such as road and rail upgrades on the eastern seaboard and the expansion of the U-Tapao International Airport.
The state-run management company, Airports of Thailand, will upgrade three of the country's major airports in 2019-23 to increase passenger capacity: Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi airports in Bangkok towards the end of the forecast period, and U-Tapao in Rayong province, south-east of the capital, in 2020. New airports will also be constructed in Chiang Mai and Phuket, although completion is likely to fall beyond the end of the forecast period. These will mainly be aimed at accommodating tourist arrivals from East Asia, especially China.
The telecoms sector will lag behind Thailand's regional peers
Thailand's telecoms networks have been slow to adopt the latest technology, exposing inefficiencies in the regulatory environment. The regulator expects the commercial launch of 5G bandwidth in 2020, although we believe that this will not take place before 2021, due to the high level of investment required and low business confidence. The new bandwidth will lag behind most other Asian countries in terms of speed, owing to shortfalls in service provider technology.
The government's Power Development Plan, which took effect in mid-2019, proposes to more than double the capacity of alternative energy sources by 2037 (primarily in solar and biomass), to import hydropower from neighbouring countries and to encourage the issuance of green bonds to finance energy projects. Nuclear power options are still under discussion but have faced significant public opposition. No new capacity from this form is expected to be added in the forecast period. This, and delays in transitioning to renewable energy, will ensure Thailand that remains reliant on natural gas for electricity production in 2019-23.

Thailand experiences a modest improvement in its technological readiness score in 2019-23, which boosts both its global and regional rankings. Nonetheless, internet use exerts a fundamental drag on Thailand's performance. Although the number of internet users per 100 population, at 56.8 in 2018, has increased in recent years, it remains below those of Malaysia (81.2) and the Philippines (60.1). This limits Thailand's viability for e-commerce and digital services. Its level of commercial innovation also falls below regional par. This is partly due to the preference of international companies with manufacturing operations in the country to carry out their research and development (R&D) elsewhere. This accounts in part for the low level of patent applications per capita.
Efforts to expand broadband access to villages will face delays
The new government has outlined plans to pursue digital infrastructure projects initiated by the junta as part of the Thailand 4.0 strategy and the 20-year digital roadmap. These include projects to bring national broadband to 25,000 remote communities, in order to develop rural areas and to give private-sector enterprises access to public infrastructure. We expect progress on this goal to be sluggish, owing to weak implementation capacity; the government has previously missed a target of delivering broadband to all villages by end-2018.
The Board of Investment has introduced import duty exemptions on raw materials used in R&D, to incentivise the development of innovative capacities in the private sector. Companies focused on biotechnology, nanotechnology, advanced materials or digital technology are also eligible for up to 13 years' exemption from corporate income tax if they co-operate with public research institutions in R&D.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Similarly to the junta that preceded it, the new government will continue to accord a high priority to economic revival and to pursue policies aimed at boosting the country's medium-to-long-term investment prospects, including ramping up public spending on infrastructure. This includes the development of a large special economic zone, the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), south-east of the capital, Bangkok, based on new and upgraded transport links. The drive to boost investment will also include the continuation of the sector-specific "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy package, which will provide significant investment incentives for foreign investors within and outside the EEC. Both of these plans fit broadly with the 20-year National Strategy, the junta's blueprint for the country's long-term social and economic development, and are likely to be pursued through large sums of foreign investment and ad hoc fiscal spending. Elsewhere, the government will look to diversify export markets in an effort to boost the flailing external sector.
Opposition efforts to scale back these reforms will often be unsuccessful owing to the new constitution, which restricts the alteration of policies deemed by the current military government to be important to Thailand's medium-to-long-term reform. Indeed, the military-aligned Senate will be permitted to join the House of Representatives in debating legislation pertaining to the National Strategy.
However, policy paralysis will sometimes occur on issues such as social welfare, inequality and military spending, where pro- and anti-junta forces tend to diverge, resulting in intermittent legislative gridlock and delays. Occasionally, policy disagreements will also emerge from within the Phalang Pracharat-led coalition. Demand-side stimulatory and relief measures to placate interest groups-such as farmers and low income households-will nonetheless remain prominent, but will lessen towards the end of the forecast period as the authorities seek to consolidate the public finances.

Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government revenue 15.9 18.0 18.1 18.7 18.6 18.5
Budget balance -2.5 -2.8 -2.6 -2.3 -2.3 -2.7
We expect the budget deficit to average the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP in 2019-23. Infrastructure spending and populist handouts will form the bulk of government spending, particularly in the early part of the forecast period. The government will seek to mitigate the fiscal impact of these measures through incremental tax reform initiated under the junta. A reformed schedule of property taxes, which will be applied by 2020, will boost revenue later in the forecast period-albeit only modestly, as the original proposals were diluted in order to avoid public objections. Stronger trade growth in 2021-23 will boost revenue from import and export duties and help to ensure that the deficit remains below 3% of GDP throughout the forecast period. The slight raising of value-added tax (VAT) in the latter part of the forecast period, from the current rate of 7%, will also bolster revenue. The increase, however, will be gradual, as the government remains wary of dampening the modest rate of private consumption growth.

Money market interest rate (year-end) 1.5 1.6 1.5 2.0 2.4 2.4
We expect the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) to leave its policy rate, the one-day repurchase rate, unchanged at 1.75% throughout 2019. The BOT's decision to increase its policy rate in December 2018 was a precautionary measure against domestic financial risks after an extended period of low interest rates. The BOT is unlikely to reverse this decision in the short term for fear that household debt could rise to potentially destabilising levels, and has more firmly pursued measures to curb borrowing in recent months. Moreover, with the policy rate already at a low level, the central bank is likely to conclude that further rate cuts will have little positive impact on the real economy or managing exchange-rate volatility. In this context, the BOT will instead rely on fiscal policy and occasional capital controls to support economic performance.
Although inflation will firm from 2020, it will remain towards the lower end of the 1-4% target range set by the BOT. This will give the central bank the policy space to maintain an accommodative stance. Although a rate cut is not part of our core forecast, the likelihood of further loosening in early 2020 could heighten if falling household debt accompanies weak growth. The BOT will sanction rate rises from 2021 as domestic and external economic conditions strengthen, but the rate will not be high relative to historical standards.

We expect real GDP to average annual growth of 3.2% in 2019-23. This underwhelming rate of economic expansion will be attributable to muted private consumption growth, which will be weighed down by continued high levels of household debt and unremarkable real wage growth, and sluggish export-oriented production. Private consumption growth will be notably weak in 2020 owing to marginal real wage growth, amid subdued prospects for the global economy.
We expect exports of goods and services to grow by 3.5% per year on average in 2019-23, compared with 3.1% in 2014-18. Growth in this component will be underpinned by services exports, in the form of tourism. Volumes of goods shipments will be more uneven. A general easing of external demand for merchandise, driven in part by a slump in the consumer electronics cycle, is resulting in slower export growth this year. This will lead to a narrowing of the trade surplus, which will be exacerbated in 2020 as the US economy slows further. Merchandise exports will rebound after that as external demand from major global economies picks up again.
In the medium term, Thai automotive exporters are likely to reap benefits from the relocation of supply chains from China, partly as a result of US-China trade tension. In the short term, the boost to the external sector will be limited by the fact that Thailand's current manufacturing capacity covers only a small fraction of the automotive exports subject to higher tariffs. This limits the extent to which it can offer short-term, cost-effective solutions to businesses considering relocation, particularly in the light of the growth of other, lower-cost automotive manufacturing hubs in the region. Nonetheless, we expect positive benefits to be felt from 2020-21 onwards as producers of auto parts and vehicles move up the value chain through advanced manufacturing, and the development of the EEC boosts the hub's competitiveness.
We expect total fixed investment to grow at a significantly stronger pace in 2019-23 than in 2014-18. This is mostly owing to our baseline assumption that the military's influence over the elected government will ensure overarching stability, including in the business environment. Investment growth will be buoyed by major infrastructure projects, which will help to offset a downturn in private investment in 2020, amid weaker expectations for external demand. Investment will reach a peak of activity in 2022, supporting growth in capital goods imports as oil prices pick up. Despite a dip in 2020, private investment will be notably more robust in 2020-23 on average than in 2014-18 as foreign companies capitalise on incentives offered in the EEC and under the Thailand 4.0 initiative.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow most quickly, at an average annual rate of 3.9% in 2019-23. Thailand has been successful in taking the lead in certain industrial sectors, such as the automotive industry, in addition to some high-technology subsectors, most notably electronics and machinery components. However, its relative technical competitiveness will slowly decline owing to a lack of investment, growing regional competition and an easing of external demand early in the forecast period. These factors will put pressure on industrial growth in the early part of the forecast period, after which industrial production will accelerate amid increased public investment in infrastructure and a more stable policy environment. Stronger external demand in 2021-23 will also buoy investment sentiment in the largely export-oriented sector. Over the longer term, Thailand risks losing its role as a predominant producer of intermediate manufactured goods to rapidly growing regional economies with cheaper labour.
The services sector will continue to be dominated by the tourism industry
The services sector will grow by an annual average of 2.9% in 2019-23. Despite a coup in 2014, growth in the sector averaged 4.5% a year in 2014-18 amid surging tourist arrivals from the wider Asian region, especially China. In the forecast period the growth rate will normalise somewhat, due in part to slowing growth in tourist arrivals and related expenditure. Similarly, the retail sector-the largest component of services-will continue to expand at a slower rate over the forecast period. Meanwhile, the financial sector will remain relatively healthy. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, at 2.9%, has remained fairly stable since 2015, and banks are well capitalised. However, household debt remains elevated, which will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2019-23. In the first quarter of 2019 household debt stood at 78.7% of GDP and outstanding personal consumption loans (from commercial banks) grew at the fastest pace in nearly five years. Elsewhere, the telecommunications segment will see strong growth towards the end of the forecast period as the consumer electronics cycle recovers from its slump and the development of 5G networks takes place. This will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services and will dovetail with the continued expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The agriculture sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by inclement weather events, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to upgrade from current basic technologies. Some subsectors, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to Western countries' market-access requirements regarding labour rights and the government clamps down on unregistered migrant labour. These weaknesses will ensure that farmers remain an important interest group for the new government. We expect the agriculture sector to grow by an annual average of 2.4% in 2019-23.

Real wages 0.3 1.8 0.5 3.1 2.3 1.3
Labour costs per hour (US$) 3.0 3.2 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.5
Consumer price inflation will average 1.6% per year in 2019-23. This compares with an average of 0.6% in 2014-18 and reflects stronger growth in domestic demand during much of the forecast period and a more stable outlook for global oil prices. In 2019 upward pressure on food prices, owing to drought conditions in parts of Thailand and the African swine fever in parts of Asia, will be partially offset by an anticipated decline in global oil prices in the second half of the year. Local price pressures will remain weak in 2020 against a backdrop of economic deceleration in the US, which will keep a lid on global commodity prices that year. Thereafter, stronger global economic activity and slightly firmer domestic demand will help to lift average annual inflation to 1.7% in 2021-23. This rate will be well below that of Thailand's regional peers, but is justified, given continued unimpressive growth in household consumption.

A large current-account surplus and sizeable foreign-exchange reserves will support the local currency, the baht, throughout the forecast period. In addition, the BOT will readily intervene to curb any exchange-rate volatility that arises. We expect the currency to depreciate against the US dollar from the second half of 2019 and in 2020 as concerns about weak external demand undermine investor confidence. The latter part of the forecast period will see the baht's value remain relatively stable as macroeconomic fundamentals strengthen. We forecast that the baht will appreciate by an annual average of 0.1% in 2021-23 as exports return to a stronger rate of growth than in 2019-20.

Secondary income: debit -3.8 -3.7 -3.8 -4.2 -4.6 -5.0
Secondary income balance 8.0 7.6 7.2 7.2 7.2 7.2
We expect the current-account surplus to average 7.1% of GDP in 2019-23. This will broadly mirror fluctuations in the trade surplus, which will be determined in large part by global oil prices and external demand for Thai goods. Lacklustre demand, exacerbated by a slump in the consumer electronics cycle, has contributed to a weakness in merchandise shipments that will persist into 2020. Nonetheless, the trade surplus will widen next year as global oil prices fall. Conversely, a rise in oil prices in 2021 will offset the positive effect of a recovery in merchandise shipments that year, causing the current account to narrow from 7.9% in 2019 to 6.5% in 2021. It will widen in 2023, reaching 7.3% amid steadier merchandise shipments growth and still-rising oil prices.
Despite these downward pressures on the current account, the overall surplus will be supported by continual growth in services exports, stemming almost entirely from tourism spend. The primary income account will remain firmly in deficit in 2019-23, reflecting the continued repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign-owned firms. This will be partly offset by a consistent surplus on the secondary income account from personal transfers, notably remittances.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand
Stocks and flows
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (including earnings reinvested by companies already operating in Thailand) were volatile in 2014-18 owing to political uncertainty and a downturn in external demand. Nonetheless, FDI inflows have increased steadily since 2015, owing to the previous junta's efforts to attract infrastructure investment, which included a range of incentives and the liberalisation of strategic industries. Expectations of policy continuity under the new government should help to support this upward trend during 2019-23. Outward investment, particularly to countries within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), is also expected to increase. In 2018 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$237bn, equivalent to 46.8% of GDP, while the stock of outward FDI stood at US$134bn.
Origin and distribution
The private manufacturing sector has traditionally attracted the largest proportion of FDI into Thailand. In particular, manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances have attracted significant foreign interest in recent years. However, the financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence, particularly as industrial production faces headwinds from weak external conditions. Japanese firms have historically been the main investors in Thailand, but investment from China has greatly increased in the past few years. Chinese investors, at least as much as their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure development plans, but this will come in the form of services contracts in construction and logistics planning.
Determinants
Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its relatively competitive labour costs, flexible labour laws and advantageous location within the region. Nonetheless, any sign of political instability, as well as growing regional competition, will pose a risk to Thailand's attractiveness in the medium term. The Board of Investment (BOI) offers incentives, which generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including granting permission to bring in foreign workers, to own land and to take or remit foreign currency abroad. Thailand has generally been regarded as open to foreign investment. Although regulatory uncertainties do exist, the new government is likely to address these quickly. Indeed, the new large-scale Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. The EEC fits within the seven-year investment promotion strategy launched by the BOI in 2015, which extended incentives to newer industries such as "alternative energy and environmental services" and "hospitality and wellness", while removing existing incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries. The BOI has also been encouraging investment into infrastructure, through a small number of big-ticket projects. In addition, it has expedited the investment application and approval process in recent years, and is likely to retain this as a priority under the new government. Disagreements from lawmakers will occasionally slow the pace of decision-making related to investment, with opposition parties keen to enforce greater oversight of infrastructure projects.
Impact
Inflows of FDI have been volatile over the past decade, amid global economic weakness, flood damage and repeated bouts of political uncertainty. Large FDI inflows have helped to support overall economic growth and have contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pick-up trucks), electronics (especially computer parts) and electrical appliances. Reliance on FDI has nonetheless made the economy vulnerable to external conditions; investor sentiment has buckled in recent months, owing to political uncertainty and easing demand in key markets.
Potential
Thailand's political scene has stabilised since the public approval of the junta-drafted constitution in a referendum in 2016 and the smooth accession of the new king. After a brief period of uncertainty around the election held in March 2019, political stability will be maintained in 2019-23. Challenges to the new political structure are unlikely to materialise before the next election (due in 2023), which bodes well for steadier FDI flows in the forecast period compared with 2014-18. However, a number of other challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has been diminishing because of a rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and sluggish domestic demand outside the tourism sector. Although the current administration will maintain the junta's commitment to liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to important sectors such as telecommunications and utilities remains in question. Although the standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, it remains poorer than in Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location, and, increasingly, Vietnam. The junta-drafted infrastructure development programme, which the new government will follow, will rectify this shortfall somewhat. Although Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of its leading position in the development of the ASEAN Free-Trade Area, there is a risk that it may lose out to other countries in the region as they make improvements to their business environments at a faster rate.

Effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate relatively low, at 0.2% a year, in the forecast period. By 2023 the population is forecast to reach 70.2m, with females accounting for 51.4% of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 8.4 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 9.4 per 1,000 in 2014-18. Life expectancy will also improve, with men expected to live for an average of 72.1 years in 2019-23, up from 71 in 2014-18, while female life expectancy will rise from an average of 78.6 to 79.5 years over the same period.
Demographic ageing will exert strain on healthcare provision
Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion aged under 15 set to fall to 15.5% in 2023, from 18.8% in 2011, and the proportion aged over 65 rising steadily. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio falls to 0.22 in 2023, from 0.26 in 2012, while the old-age dependency ratio rises from 0.13 to 0.21 over the same period. This demographic trend will place further strain on healthcare provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme that was introduced in 2001 and has been free for all citizens since 2006. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period. It will, nonetheless, face growing burdens resulting from the country's rising levels of pollution and ageing population.
Road accidents will continue to be a leading cause of death
The crude death rate is forecast at 8.2 per 1,000 in 2019-23. Non-communicable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases are responsible for 74% of all deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO also reports that Thailand has the world's second-highest road traffic fatality rate, accounting for 5% of total deaths (based on 2012 data). Deteriorating air quality-pollution levels in Bangkok and northern provinces hit record highs in 2019-also poses a threat of increased premature deaths and health burdens. Meanwhile, Thailand continues to confront the challenge of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which emerged as the country's leading cause of death in the early 2000s. The WHO estimates the death rate from the disease at around 23 per 100,000 people in 2016, although 450,000 people continued to live with the disease in that year. Other infectious diseases such as cholera, measles and mumps have become less common but have not been eradicated.
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, and shortages of skilled labour are likely in the next five years. Labour force growth will remain almost flat in 2019-23, reaching 38.6m by 2023, despite a decline in the working-age population. This will be largely due to increasing numbers of women choosing to work outside the home. Migrant labour will remain abundant, with workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos dominating unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees. However, Thailand will gradually become a less attractive destination for unskilled migrants over the long term. In the near term this will partly reflect a less welcoming stance on the part of the authorities, who are keen to channel unskilled migrant labour into legitimate strategic industries in border-located special economic zones. In the longer term, job opportunities in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will expand as those economies grow.
Rural-urban migration is still a significant demographic trend
Despite slow population growth, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period, with a subsequent reduction in average household size. Internal migration and changing social patterns mean that it is increasingly common for households to consist of nuclear rather than extended families. Steady economic expansion in recent years has encouraged this trend, as migrant workers from rural areas have been moving to the major cities, and particularly the metropolitan area centred on the capital, Bangkok. Although Bangkok remains the main focus for the urban population, other cities, including Surat Thani, Chiang Mai and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. This will result in the urban population increasing to 54.1% of the total in 2023, from 50% in 2018.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69.4m and nominal GDP equivalent to around US$505.3bn at market exchange rates in 2018. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that firms located in Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's population of 500m, including a burgeoning middle class with growing disposable income.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will grow at a faster rate in 2019-23 than it did in 2014-18, as economic activity strengthens compared with the historical period on the back of greater policy stability. Nonetheless, national wealth distribution will remain alarmingly disparate between the regions. According to the latest data from the Asian Development Bank, of the 7.9% of the population defined as living below the nationally defined poverty line in 2017 (living on US$45 or less per month), the majority reside in the rural north and north-eastern parts of the country. The capital, Bangkok, remains the wealthiest region by far, with personal disposable income vastly exceeding the national average. Government measures to narrow the wealth gap, such as hand-outs and tax cuts, tend to be short-term in outlook and unsustainable. Structural issues, such as the fact that opportunities in rural areas remain limited compared with urban centres, will remain largely unaddressed.
High household debt will undermine disposable incomes in 2019-23
Household spending will be tempered by still-high personal debt. In particular, debt burdens among those on lower incomes have a significant negative impact on consumer demand overall and limit the prospects for social mobility among this group. This will particularly affect the share available for spending on consumer goods, ensuring that Thailand's retail goods market experiences relatively low growth. Nonetheless, the large tourism sector will lend some support to the retail sector during the forecast period. In 2021-22, as the level of debt subsides and the economy experiences a recovery, the release of pent-up demand will help to underpin retail sales. On average, retail sales volumes will grow by 2.4% a year in 2019-23.

Private consumption will grow by an annual average of 3.4% in 2019-23, faster than the rate of 2.7% in 2014-18 but below the country's full potential. In the early part of the forecast period elevated household debt and a slowdown in economic activity will dampen consumer sentiment. The new government will maintain policies aimed at supporting consumption through various subsidies and support packages aimed at helping low-income citizens. Given the still-frail state of private consumption, the value-added tax (VAT) rate is unlikely to be raised from the current level of 7% until later in the forecast period, despite discussion of such a move. The government will instead focus on wealth taxes, such as the new inheritance and property taxes, so that it can also provide some tax relief for lower-income households. Meanwhile, higher "sin taxes" on sugar, alcohol and tobacco will have a minor impact on the population at large.
Free public healthcare will hold down consumer expenditure in that area
Consumer expenditure on essential items, such as food, household goods and clothing, will fall slightly as a proportion of total expenditure as average incomes rise. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants is likely to increase as a result of several trends: a rise in the number of women who work (leading to a fall in the number of meals cooked at home); government efforts to promote domestic tourism; and cheaper domestic travel owing to the expansion of budget airlines and rail routes. Expenditure on leisure and education will rise at pace, as higher-income households experience the biggest gains from economic growth in the forecast period. Growth in healthcare spending is forecast to increase gradually in 2019-23, compared with 2014-18, owing to relatively comprehensive free public healthcare, which we do not expect to be rescinded in the forecast period. The projected increase in spending on transport and communications will largely reflect the expanding market for information technology products, which will be boosted by national upgrades to internet services.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: The past two decades have been characterised by political turmoil, with coups in 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis owing to natural disasters and political crises. The new government, despite its efforts to revive the economy, will oversee relatively lacklustre growth as the country returns to democratic rule. Physical infrastructure will also remain inadequate and strained in many respects. Reform of the education system, which is sorely needed, has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the curriculum. The workforce is therefore characterised by a low level of technical skills-a problem made worse by rapidly demographic ageing.
Demographic trends: Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the ageing population. The female labour force participation rate will be relatively high by 2030, and is expected to rise only modestly from then on. This will lead to an average annual contraction of almost 1% in the labour force in 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation concerning immigrants' right to work will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immigration policies further, owing to the country's negative demographic profile. The effectiveness of this will be limited by concerns among immigrants regarding political freedom, worsening air pollution and the growing attractiveness of neighbouring regions.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. Although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China, Thailand will struggle to capitalise on this opportunity owing to a lack of competitiveness compared with lower-cost locations, such as Cambodia and Bangladesh. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Myanmar. Closer integration with China could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China, meeting that country's increasing demand for foreign holidays, regional-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. The government is already spearheading a move in that direction under its "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy and, in part, via its new Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone. This is particularly the case for the tourism industry, and the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way to supporting these aims. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so. The development of the ASEAN Economic Community, formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand to the degree that the country retains its prominence in the region. In 2019-30 a relocation of regional supply chains will take place in order to capitalise upon changing tariff regimes and increased trade tensions. Although Thailand will benefit from these shifts, gains will be limited by the growing manufacturing capabilities of neighbours like Vietnam.
Institutions and policy trends: In the coming decades there will be no resolution of the power struggle between the established military and bureaucratic elites in the capital, Bangkok, who will continue to side with the palace to bolster their legitimacy, and the rural masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate. The level of political tension will depend on successive governments' ability to restructure the economy further away from agriculture, not least by moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reform, as well as a focus on medium-to-long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on whether the government retains the political authority required to initiate appropriate structural reform that will continue into the medium-to-long term, while also upgrading infrastructure. Implementing comprehensive liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population could be offset by improving educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce or by measures to facilitate greater immigrant access to the labour market. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Thailand published a long-term climate change adaptation plan in 2015, entitled the Climate Change Master Plan 2015-50. It outlines a three-pronged approach divided into mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building targets. The near-term goals included setting emission-reduction targets and establishing incentives for low-carbon emission development. Medium-term targets included reaching at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable sources. Longer-term targets are vaguer, with general goals to increase private investment in green industries and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy. In line with this plan, Thailand signed and ratified the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2016, committing to specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under COP21, Thailand has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from the projected business-as-usual forecast by 2030.
The main determinant of emissions levels in Thailand in the coming decades will continue to be energy sourcing. Coal-fired power plants generate close to one-fifth of the country's electricity, while lesser-polluting liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation. Most of these plants are situated in the south of the country. The government will continue to push for the expansion of renewable energy sources as a share of the country's energy mix, and renewable energy is likely to account for around a quarter of total generation capacity by 2040. The commissioning of nuclear power plants in Thailand, which would reduce reliance on high-polluting forms, is also a possibility. However, the relatively low prices of coal and gas will mean that these continue to account for the majority of energy generation over the next two decades.
The country will be vulnerable to the intensified impact of climate change in the coming decades. This will be felt most acutely through the rising sea level, flooding, droughts and air pollution, which will in turn feed into economic insecurity, infrastructure strains, health burdens and social unrest. This year we have developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Thai economy will be 3.1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments
In May 2016 the junta unveiled "Thailand 4.0", a sector-specific industrial policy that aims to attract new investment in the transformation of the economy. The name of the strategy describes the intended next stage in the sectoral development of the economy, characterised by the industrial application of state-of-the-art technology. It follows the current domestic industrial situation, which is dominated by heavy industry with advanced machinery, in segments such as automotive and chemicals production. The Thailand 4.0 strategy focuses on ten strategic industries that are already found in Thailand, but where value can be added via new technologies; these include smart electronics, high-income and medical tourism, agriculture and biotechnology, food and beverages, and the automotive industry. It will also extend to the development of new industries, such as robotics, aerospace, digital services, bioenergy and biochemicals, and healthcare. Incentives for investment in these sectors will remain in place for several years and are explicitly targeted towards the introduction of new technology, for example by offering import-duty exemption on capital goods for listed industries. Thailand will make some progress in upgrading its industries, but is likely to be constrained by a limited supply of skilled labour.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]the Liberal government plans to introduce (in January 2020) the same federal carbon tax in Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans that met federal standards. According to the monthly Teranet-National Bank National Composite House Price Index, prices softened in September 2018-April 2019 but edged up in May-June. According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down in March, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn-equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. [...]we expect the shortfall on the current account to ease to an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2019-20.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October election. However, it will be a close contest, and the Liberal government's current parliamentary majority is at risk.
The renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has eased trade uncertainty, but we expect delays in the ratification process of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, NAFTA's successor), probably until 2020. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its main export market.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019, owing to weaker private consumption growth and an economic slowdown in the US. Subdued domestic demand will keep growth below trend at 1.7% in 2020, but real GDP growth will pick up to an average of 2.3% per year in 2021-23.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 2% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020, reflecting weaker domestic and external demand, and generally lower oil prices. It will pick up to an average of 2.1% per year in 2021-23 as the economy regains momentum.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. We expect it to keep rates on hold in 2019, before sanctioning a 25-basis-point cut in 2020, as global economic growth slows further. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 (compared with 2018) will be more than offset by slower domestic demand and, therefore, import growth, causing the merchandise trade deficit to narrow. As a result, we expect the shortfall on the current account to ease to an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2019-20.

Canada's score improves in 2019-23, pushing the country up to ninth place in our global business environment ranking and first place in our regional ranking. The best features of the business environment are political stability and openness to trade, although tax policy and the labour market will remain constraints.
Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.

Background: The Canadian economy was the tenth-largest in the world in 2018 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 75% of its goods exports and is the source of 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue; just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the two leading political parties in the province is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party has led a majority government since 2015; the next general election will be held in October 2019.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. In 2016 the government introduced a new top marginal rate of personal income tax of 33%, which applies to taxable income higher than C$210,371 (US$157,706) in 2019.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$17bn in 2018, and the current-account deficit was US$45.3bn (2.6% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party government, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, won a majority at the federal election in 2015, ending a decade of Conservative Party rule. The government has made progress on most of its reform agenda; however, controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case has tarnished Mr Trudeau's political brand, and friction with provincial administrations over environmental policy has intensified. The next federal election is due on October 21st, and unofficial campaigning started after parliament went into recess in June. The opposition Conservatives remain slightly ahead in opinion surveys, but the Liberal Party has regained ground and the election results will be tight. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberals to remain in government after the election, but the party's parliamentary majority is at risk, raising the prospect of periodic legislative gridlock.
Mr Trudeau's popularity has been damaged by his mishandling earlier this year of allegations by the former attorney-general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, that he and his officials put inappropriate political pressure on her to abandon the criminal prosecution for alleged fraud of SNC-Lavalin, a large Quebec-based construction and engineering firm, which denies the charges. Ms Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, resigned from their positions, citing lack of confidence in the government. They were both expelled from the caucus in April and will run as independents in October. As a result, the issue is likely to fester in the run-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments has intensified in recent months, owing mainly to disagreements on environmental legislation. Opposition parties have taken control of several provincial governments in recent years, setting the stage for policy battles ahead of the federal election. The most significant change of power has been the return to provincial government in Alberta of the United Conservative Party, which defeated the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) government at the provincial election in April. The new Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, is a vocal critic of the federal Liberal government's environmental policies, which he argues have harmed Alberta's resource-based economy. In May he repealed the carbon tax in the province, which was introduced by the former NDP government. As a result, the Liberal government plans to introduce (in January 2020) the same federal carbon tax in Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans that met federal standards. Like its counterparts in Ontario and Saskatchewan, the Alberta government contends that the federal carbon tax is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court of Canada will ultimately rule on the matter. The Conservatives have pledged to repeal the federal carbon tax if elected in October.
The nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project has also raised questions regarding federal jurisdiction. The expansion, designed to carry additional crude oil from Alberta to a port in British Columbia (BC), is opposed by the NDP provincial government in BC and by environmentalists, and the federal cabinet's decision in June to proceed with the project is controversial.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Following the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Conservative Party overtook the Liberals in opinion surveys in February 2019, although much of that lead has whittled away in recent weeks. According to an average of recent polls published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on August 12th, 33.8% of respondents supported the Conservatives, compared with 32.8% who backed the Liberals. The NDP was well behind, in third place, backed by 13.8% of those surveyed. Mr Trudeau's overall approval rating is on a par with that of the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer.
We expect the Liberal Party to be in a position to form a minority government after the federal election, due on October 21st 2019, reflecting the advantages of incumbency and the implementation of much of the government's agenda, including the legalisation of cannabis. However, the contest will be tight. Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and have built momentum under Mr Scheer. They will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes, government spending, the cost of its climate-change policies and its broken pledge to change the electoral system from first-past-the-post to proportional representation. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing more than 45,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
The Liberal government's foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. The contrast with policies pursued by the US president, Donald Trump, will continue to strain bilateral relations with the US during the remainder of Mr Trump's administration. Canada will nonetheless seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far, in part by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The signing in November 2018 of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and preserve the trilateral arrangement, has mitigated some trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier one; in particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, on which Canada relies to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. Canada also negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports, and the US has been granted greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). The lifting in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports has removed a major obstacle to ratification of the USMCA; however, the timing for ratification of the agreement poses a challenge for all three administrations. Ongoing delays on the US-Mexico side, and Canada's parliamentary recess until November 2019, will complicate the ratification process. Our central forecast is that the USMCA will ultimately be ratified by all three nations, but we now believe that this will be extended into 2020.
China was a major target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities on fraud charges (that she denies). Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. In March the Canadian government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition. In response, China detained two Canadians on charges of spying, sentenced two others convicted of drug crimes to death and has used non-tariff barriers to impede agricultural imports from Canada, including canola (rapeseed). Bilateral relations will remain tense for as long as Ms Meng faces the threat of extradition to the US.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to major Asian markets over the 2019-23 forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines; when the deal is fully implemented, that figure will rise to 99%.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government will seek to support domestic industries that are adversely affected by US trade protectionism and Canada's trade issues with China. Measures to boost the competitiveness of Canadian businesses following tax cuts in the US last year included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. However, the government will struggle to balance environmental policy with support for the fossil fuel industry. It has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20(US$15)/tonne in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. This tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. However, the government has also approved the controversial C$7.4bn (US$5.5bn) expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which it now owns. The project still faces some regulatory hurdles, and construction work, which is scheduled to begin this year, could be delayed further by legal challenges.
Policymakers will continue to monitor the residential property market, which will remain a risk owing to overleveraged Canadian households. Measures introduced by the federal government and provincial governments in Ontario and BC in recent years have helped to cool the tight housing market. In Vancouver and Toronto foreign buyers are subject to an additional tax on property purchases, and the federal government has tightened mortgage requirements nationwide, which has improved the quality of new mortgage lending. According to the monthly Teranet-National Bank National Composite House Price Index, prices softened in September 2018-April 2019 but edged up in May-June. Despite falling mortgage interest rates, we still expect the housing market to remain sluggish in 2019, reflecting a combination of tighter lending standards, continued affordability pressures and diminished investor activity. However, the risk of a major correction appears to have eased.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure and other spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but these will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the introduction of the carbon tax and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018, and a slower pace of economic expansion, mean that government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections overall, weighing on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down in March, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn-equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. Official projections show the budget deficit contracting to C$9.8bn (equivalent to 0.4% of GDP) by 2023/24. We project that the fiscal deficit will expand from 0.4% of GDP in 2018 (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based) to 0.9% of GDP in 2019 and 1% of GDP in 2020. The government will seek to reduce the shortfall in the longer term, and we expect the deficit to contract gradually, to 0.7% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Between July 2017 and October 2018 the Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points. This was in response to rising inflation and to discourage highly indebted households from accumulating further debt. The BoC has since kept rates steady. The year-on-year inflation rate has picked up to close to the BoC's 2% target, and the economy appears to have perked up in the second quarter, following a slow start to the year. However, the BoC has cautioned that the economic outlook remains clouded by global trade tensions, which will continue to weigh on export growth and investment.
We forecast that the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) will follow up the cut to its policy rate in July with another in November 2019, and one more in March 2020. We continue to expect the BoC to keep its policy rate unchanged this year, as it views the current level of 1.75% as stimulatory. However, we expect it to sanction a 25-basis-point cut in early 2020 as US growth slows further; because of the close ties between the two countries, this will weigh on economic growth in Canada. The BoC will begin to tighten monetary policy gradually again from 2021.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to 1.9% in 2018, from 3% in 2017, and we expect the pace of economic expansion to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. Previous monetary tightening, high household debt levels and the subdued housing market will weigh on private consumption growth this year, although solid growth in government spending will help to cushion the impact. Export growth is also expected to moderate as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's main export market.
The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the major downside risks to our forecast, although it looks likely that the timeline for the ratification of the successor agreement, the USMCA, will be extended into 2020. Canadian producers and manufacturers will benefit from the removal in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports, and the end of the retaliatory import tariffs that Canada imposed, but are feeling the pinch from trade restrictions imposed by China on some Canadian farm exports, such as canola. Global trade uncertainty remains a major downside risk to our forecast. Other risks to the economic outlook include a sharp drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
We have revised up slightly our real GDP growth forecast for 2020 to 1.7% (from 1.6% previously), reflecting a modest upward revision to our projection for world trade growth next year. However, with economic growth in the US and domestic demand in Canada continuing to lose steam, the overall pace of economic expansion will remain well below its long-term trend next year. Real GDP growth is expected to pick up again in 2021, and will average 2.4% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued public investment in infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices through much of last year and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures in 2018, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation accelerated to an average of 2.2%. In the first quarter of 2019 the inflation rate fell back to 1.6% year on year, owing to lower petrol prices and the impact of previous monetary tightening by the central bank. However, in the second quarter it picked up to 2.2% year on year, underpinned by higher food and energy costs. Subdued economic growth and generally lower oil prices will keep inflation at around the BoC's 2% target rate overall in 2019-20. We forecast that the inflation rate will pick up from 2021 as the economy regains momentum and the unemployment rate starts to fall again.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Falling oil prices and slowing growth weighed on the currency late last year in the first few months of 2019, although the Fed's dovish stance has caused the Canadian dollar to firm against its US counterpart since June. Nevertheless, the Canadian currency will depreciate slightly this year, to C$1.32:US$1 on average. Downward pressure on the Canadian dollar next year from continued weak economic growth, soft oil prices and modest monetary easing by the BoC in early 2020 will be mitigated by deeper interest rate cuts from the Fed (which we expect will cut rates again in December 2019 and March 2020). As a result, the local currency will be broadly unchanged, at an average of C$1.33:US$1 in 2020. A pick-up in growth from 2021 and the resumption of monetary tightening will underpin a modest appreciation in the Canadian dollar in 2021-23, with the currency forecast to average C$1.30:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be more than offset by slower domestic demand and, therefore, import growth, causing the merchandise trade deficit to narrow. As a result, we expect the shortfall on the current account to ease to an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2019-20. The CPTPP, the effects of which will begin to be felt from 2020, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. This will help to narrow the current-account deficit to a forecast 2.3% of GDP by 2023.

Abstract: The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. [...]the new government, which is subject to strict policy conditionality under the EU's enhanced surveillance regime, will have limited room for manoeuvre to change course to a more growth-friendly policy mix. On this front, Greece has benefitted from a combination of global central banks' monetary policy shift to an easing bias since late 2018, as well as financial market optimism about the prospect of a change of government in Greece. Since returning to the debt markets after a three-year absence in July 2017, the secondary market interest rate on Greek ten-year government bonds has fallen by 345 basis points, to just 2.1% at end-July, narrowing the spread over equivalent German government bonds by about 250 basis points, to 255 basis points.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In a snap general election held on July 7th 2019, the main centre-right opposition party, New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recorded a comfortable victory over the left-wing ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) led by Alexis Tsipras. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the single-party ND government will provide the basis for more stable and effective administration, but that it will struggle with the multiple challenges inherited from Mr Tsipras's administration.
Greece will remain under "enhanced supervision" by euro zone creditors during the forecast period (2019-23) and beyond, until its huge public debt of more than 180% of GDP is substantially reduced. We do not expect Greece's creditors to allow the new government to renegotiate the annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter in order to adopt more growth-friendly policies of tax cuts. Protests are likely to continue as the government continues striving to meet the ambitious budget targets.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited its euro zone bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, it will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
After expanding by 1.9% in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to reach 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and an annual average of about 2.1% in 2021-23. Meeting large primary budget surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove difficult. Public debt is forecast to remain high, at just over 170% of GDP in 2023.
Inflation (EU harmonised) will remain subdued, rising only slightly-from 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 1% in 2019-20-reflecting significant slack in the labour market, moderate domestic demand growth and low global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to rise, bringing inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect narrow current-account deficits in 2019-23, compared with an annual average of 7.1% of GDP since 2001, when Greece joined the euro zone.

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period, with progress in most categories. However, Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions, which will constrain real GDP growth and keep Greece's debt burden high.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The new government seeks to revive the country's privatisation programme, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Ongoing US-China trade tension and risk of new trade tariffs between EU and US. Possible no deal Brexit poses risks for Greek services trade, especially tourism.
2021-23: Significant risk of Greece leaving euro zone in long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base, but rates remain high despite moderate tax cuts, reflecting the need to reduce the large government debt burden. Mandatory introduction of electronic point-of-sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still-high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. Private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA), but ND returned to power in July 2019 and XA failed to win enough votes to enter parliament.
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% (29% in 2018) and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to 2.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In a snap general election held on July 7th 2019, three months before the end of the parliamentary term, the main centre-right opposition party, New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recorded a comfortable victory over the left-wing ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) led by Alexis Tsipras. ND obtained 39.85% of the national vote, which, along with a 50-seat bonus awarded to the party with the most votes, gave Mr Mitsotakis's party 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament.
The new government is the first single-party government since the start of the Greek crisis nearly a decade ago, which should provide the basis for a more stable and effective government. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects the new administration to struggle with the multiple challenges inherited from Mr Tsipras's administration, not least reassuring Greece's international creditors that ND's programme of tax cuts and spending increases will not jeopardise the country's route to debt sustainability. This task has been made harder by the fiscal loosening of the outgoing government in the run-up to the elections this year. As a result, the new government, which is subject to strict policy conditionality under the EU's enhanced surveillance regime, will have limited room for manoeuvre to change course to a more growth-friendly policy mix. It is therefore unlikely that real GDP growth will rise to much more than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, further hindering the new government's ability to reduce Greece's public debt of more than 180% of GDP to a more sustainable level.
Syriza performed better than might have been expected in the general election, winning 31.53% of the vote and 86 seats (compared with 35.5% in the September 2015 general election). This should be sufficient to ensure that Mr Tsipras maintains the leadership of the party. If the party remains united, it should provide strong opposition to the ND government.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The next general election is not due until mid-2023, when Greece will also hold local, regional and European Parliament elections. In early 2020 parliament is due to elect the next president, who has a mostly ceremonial role. The incumbent, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, was elected on February 18th 2015. An enhanced majority in the previous parliament approved an amendment to the constitution to abolish provisions requiring that a minimum three-fifths majority (180 out of 300 members of parliament) be secured in the third round of presidential voting to avoid a fresh general election being called. Another constitutional amendment to repeal electoral reform introduced by Syriza (that abolished the 50-seat bonus awarded to the party winning the most votes in the general election) will, however, require approval by a three-fifths majority in the current parliament. If ND cannot muster enough support, the restoration of the 50-seat bonus will not take effect until the general election after the next one--in other words, in 2027.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability, as well as protracted economic and financial crises, has limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans, but in its final phase, the Syriza government made successful efforts to restore influence on the international scene, including the Macedonia name-change deal, which was ratified in January 2019, and talks on closer co-operation with the US. The name-change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Northern Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership. ND opposed ratification of the deal, but Mr Mitsotakis has said that he would only seek to renegotiate it if Northern Macedonia agreed.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey will persist. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and Turkish hydrocarbon exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government has inherited a challenging economic policy environment. With the general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programme in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line but with a substantial cash buffer to use while the government builds up market access. The buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover the country's financing needs until end-2020. However, this will be more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need.
Intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the Syriza government to choose the more expensive option. Nevertheless, severe policy constraints will remain during the forecast period and beyond, until Greece's huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was about 182% of GDP at end-2018, and also predominantly owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance will be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. In particular, the Syriza government has committed Greece to long-term fiscal prudence with ambitious annual primary budget surplus targets (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter until 2060 as well as implementation of reforms to tackle Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, revive the government's privatisation programme, remove remaining capital controls and eliminate state arrears to the private sector.
In exchange, Greece's EU creditors agreed in June 2018 to implement further debt-relief measures, including a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans; a reduction in the interest rates on loans of EUR130.9bn; and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt--the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of this return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2019-22. However, the debt relief will be conditional on the government's adherence to its commitments in the quarterly "enhanced surveillance" reviews. As the reviews will be published (the most recent was released in June 2019, the fourth review will begin in September), transgression by Greece could adversely affect market access. A major bone of contention between Greece's international creditors and the new ND government could be the latter's desire to renegotiate the primary surplus targets with a view to lowering them from 2020 or 2021.
In the short term Greece has sufficient funds to meet its financing requirements, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. On this front, Greece has benefitted from a combination of global central banks' monetary policy shift to an easing bias since late 2018, as well as financial market optimism about the prospect of a change of government in Greece. Since returning to the debt markets after a three-year absence in July 2017, the secondary market interest rate on Greek ten-year government bonds has fallen by 345 basis points, to just 2.1% at end-July, narrowing the spread over equivalent German government bonds by about 250 basis points, to 255 basis points. However, any signs of tension between the new government and its international creditors, for example over Greece's primary budget surplus targets or an increase in risk aversion in the global financial markets, could cause Greek yields to rise again sharply.
In the past four years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such ambitious targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Greece's exit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness in the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In 2018, after almost a decade of austerity, Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 1.1% of GDP and a primary surplus of close to 4.5% of GDP, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 3.5% of GDP. From 2019, however, we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits from 2020 and primary surpluses falling short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22 and 2.2% from 2023, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint in 2019 ahead of elections and only moderate economic growth. There is also uncertainty about the application of the Council of State's ruling that previous pension and bonus cuts implemented in 2016 were unconstitutional, raising the risk of retroactive payments.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-18 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be over 170% at end-2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
We have changed our monetary policy call and now believe that an easing package will be announced in September. This is likely to include a small cut to the deposit rate, an adjustment to the ECB's forward guidance, and the announcement of a deposit-tiering system and another round of quantitative easing (QE2), which we expect to last 12 months, starting in December 2019. We previously expected only a small cut to the deposit rate in September, but at its last meeting on July 25th the ECB sent a strong signal of its readiness to intervene; it firmly underlined its intolerance towards both "realised and projected" weak inflation, and reaffirmed its commitment to symmetry in its inflation goal of "below, but close to, 2%". The ECB announced that it had tasked the relevant Eurosystem committees with examining options for further stimulus.
The ECB is taking pre-emptive action against rising deflation risk and a deteriorating economic outlook in the euro zone, mostly driven by global trade tensions. This means that, together with another round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III), to be started in September, funding conditions will remain ultra-loose in the medium term. Details of the size and scale of the QE2 programme have not been announced, and the ECB will have to overcome at least one of its self-imposed constraints. However, we expect it to announce monthly net asset purchases of about EUR50bn that should last for 12 months. The nomination of Christine Lagarde, the current IMF chair, as ECB president is unlikely to lead to a significant change in monetary policy strategy.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The return to growth of the Greek economy since mid-2016 has been modest and remains vulnerable to domestic and external developments. As at 2018 real GDP was still more than 25% below pre-crisis levels; meanwhile, government consumption remained almost a quarter lower, household consumption one-fifth lower and gross fixed investment almost two-thirds lower. Real GDP growth accelerated from 1.4% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2018, but we expect it to remain constrained, at 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and at an annual average of about 2.1% in 2021-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector, and political and financial market instability.
A combination of elevated unemployment, high direct and indirect tax rates, heavy private-sector debt relative to household disposable income, and tight credit conditions will continue to put pressure on private consumption growth. We expect a modest acceleration in 2019-23, but this will be from a low base. Although we forecast a return to government consumption growth this year following contractions in eight of the last ten years, the pace of expansion will be modest, at 1% per year in 2019-23.
Gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17 from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 12% year on year in 2018. We expect a pick-up from this year, to an annual average of 5.2% in 2019-23. Underinvestment during the economic crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
External trade will be constrained by Greece's relatively small, uncompetitive goods exports. We expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.5% in 2019-23, down from 8.7% in 2018. However, the tourism sector faces considerable challenges, including the UK's planned departure from the EU, increased competition from Turkey and insufficient public investment.
The risk that Greece will exit the euro zone (not our core scenario) has abated since the height of the financial crisis. However, whether the country remains in the euro zone will depend on how the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond). We believe that Grexit risk could rise again in the long term, given the difficulties that Greece will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and sharp decreases in global oil prices in the final quarter of 2018 will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect the annual rate of consumer price inflation to rise modestly, from 0.8% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates and global commodity prices pick up.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro has depreciated against the dollar since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, partly owing to monetary tightening in the US. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, mostly hovering around US$1.11:EUR1-US$1.13:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weak euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable in the coming months and to average US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019. Next year it will appreciate to an average of US$1.18:EUR1 as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) further eases policy. The euro should recover more pronouncedly from 2021 on the back of ECB policy tightening as growth in the region accelerates, which, together with the euro zone's large current-account surplus, should lift the exchange rate to US$1.25:EUR1 by end-2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports due to contracting domestic demand, but also partly because of improved competitiveness, particularly in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2019-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP recorded since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufactured goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016), and the official rate will be kept fairly stable.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
Exports will be flat in 2019 and fall in 2020 as global oil prices come under pressure, but imports will also fall. Imports and exports will expand in 2021-23 but a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score will improve slightly but its global and regional rankings will worsen as the administration struggles with the reform process and other countries make more significant improvements.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but capital controls will not be necessary, barring another oil price crash.
2021-23: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will markedly increase the fiscal cost of the civil service.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically following the completion of the 2019 elections, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing and higher public-sector wages. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won a presidential election in February 2019 and will remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. However, managing the country's myriad security threats will prove an insoluble challenge. The foremost reason for this is an overstretched military and police force, which will be unable to cope with simultaneous security crises. The government cannot afford to upgrade Nigeria's security capabilities to an adequate level without making sweeping reforms to increase the tax take, and no such overhaul is anticipated.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), is heating up, with insurgents appearing better equipped and staging more audacious attacks than had been the case in recent years. Military setbacks are getting worse and, as this is one of Mr Buhari's voter strongholds, the president will be keen to reassert control over the situation. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east of Nigeria will remain a low-level conflict zone, albeit isolated, and the campaign will divert military resources from pockets of severe instability elsewhere. One such hotspot is just to the south, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, where violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for land have killed several thousand civilians in recent years. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be used to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of constricted food supply and, as a result, consumer prices.
The military and police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping in the north and north-west, where widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook. Finally, militants in the oil-producing south will remain aggrieved by inertia over their key demand for more federal revenue from hydrocarbons to be kept locally for development. Wholesale reform of the oil sector is a massive task and one that The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to be achieved in the forecast period. Our assumption is that attacks by aggrieved militants and saboteurs on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The election in February 2019 reaffirmed a deep electoral divide between the APC-supporting north and southern Nigeria, a stronghold of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). In the next general election in 2023, custom dictates that the candidates of both main parties will be southerners, giving the PDP a chance to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the 2019 presidential vote, which cost them victory. Moreover, Nigeria's economic outlook is bleak, with growth barely keeping pace with a rapidly increasing population. After two terms of lacklustre economic performance, it is likely that voter frustration will be turned on the APC, especially if the party proves as dysfunctional as it was during Mr Buhari's first term. The parliamentary election gave the APC a large majority in both houses, which in theory should be enabling, but divisions between the executive and party backbenchers were a major obstacle to reform during 2015-19. Even the basic functioning of the state was impaired, with crucial bills such as the national budget being delayed by months. As legislators typically prioritise the interests of their constituents over party and federation in Nigeria, similar tensions could easily reoccur in Mr Buhari's second stint. Disunity such as this will be easily exploitable for the PDP candidate, affording them a winning edge.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian import restrictions) could strain ties. Relations with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. For example, although Mr Buhari recently signed a continent-wide free trade agreement it is likely that protected sectors (notably in agriculture, where other countries would have a competitive advantage) will remain shielded from foreign competition.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second and final term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be pursued. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining fuel subsidies (over 90% of petrol is imported), and Mr Buhari will not willingly undo pump-price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system brings with it the risk of capital controls and will be off-putting to foreign direct investors or those acquiring illiquid assets. Concerns about this will be especially pronounced whenever global crude prices soften, but the omnipresent risk of convertibility restrictions will ultimately keep foreign direct investment well below Nigeria's potential, with inflows at less than 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC profitable rather than relinquish state control over them. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint ventures that it has with international oil companies, but demand will be held back by the difficulty of operating in Nigeria and uncertainty about fiscal terms (with deep political divisions about how to distribute hydrocarbons revenue having stalled critical legislation). As a result, investor interest will be short of official expectations and parliament will resist selling off key public assets cheaply. As a consequence, the NNPC will continue to dominate the oil sector, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes and a probable increase in value-added tax (VAT) from 5% now to 8% in 2020. Increases will be from an extremely low base however. Tax avoidance is widespread, and instability impedes collection in many parts of the country. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example, in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day-a level not seen since the oil price slump, and one unobtainable given underinvestment and OPEC production quotas. In all, federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.7% of GDP-a ratio only attained in 2022 when oil prices are at their highest point within the forecast period.
After expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with a low capital budget and poor execution. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the introduction of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, however, fiscal flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, as a result, revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit averaging 1.9% of GDP in 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against an abnormally low revenue base. Debt service has taken up to half of federal revenue in recent years, which is alarming even by heavily indebted emerging-market standards. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is minded towards boosting the supply side of the economy, but inflation is well above the targeted upper limit of 9%. On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20, notwithstanding a small rate cut by the CBN in March (upheld in May and July). This presupposes that core inflation is kept high by a recent increase in the minimum wage and increases in VAT. If this is not the case, then the CBN may sanction a rate cut in late 2019 or early 2020. Our baseline is for rates to fall in 2021 and stabilise during 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above or around the target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019-20 the economy will grow by an average of just 2.1%, held back by power shortages, insecurity, high inflation and tight credit conditions. With fiscal power being so limited, monetary policy is the main lever that can drive a recovery. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for some monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken to an average of 3.3%, which remains well below potential.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agricultural growth will be lacklustre. Although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will drive higher condensate output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans, as well as power supply gaps. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism (affecting trade), tight credit conditions affecting areas such as real estate and finance, and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will remain elevated at 11.8% in 2019, as a 67% increase in the minimum wage combines with disruptions to local food supply and widening import restrictions. In 2020 inflation at 10.9% will remain above the CBN's targeted ceiling of 9%, as demand-side forces from the minimum-wage rise continue. We also expect a 3-percentage-point rise in VAT that year, promoted by lower oil prices (and fiscal revenue coming under pressure). With base effects from this fading, core inflation will gradually ease over the rest of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Conflict and supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's agricultural heartland-will prevent a faster slide, together with widening import restrictions. Currently 43 items are barred from foreign-exchange access and the CBN wants to increase the list to 50 as a means of stimulating non-oil activity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a more market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. Although we expect a fall in exports over 2019-20, the decrease will not be steep or sustained enough to force a devaluation of the official exchange rate. Over this period flat or declining interest rates in the US will also support foreign-exchange supply via portfolio flows into fixed-income securities. Higher global crude prices thereafter mean a flat official rate is likely throughout the forecast period. In real terms, currency stability (for both the official and more market-determined rates) means real appreciation of the naira against trading partners as inflation remains high. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue or allowing more market-determined rates to weaken in order to regain international competitiveness. However, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, is set against the idea, and in any case industrial strategy is focused on supplying the domestic market. As a result, devaluation is not included in the core forecast.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The profile of export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. Output gains will keep earnings in growth in 2019, and higher global prices in 2021-23 and continued output gains (with a new mega-refinery coming on stream in around 2021) will do likewise. Only in 2020-when prices fall faster than incremental production gains-will exports drop.
Nigeria's government actively promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural produce). However, this policy is oriented more around stimulating local industry than reducing imports per se, and an overvalued naira will contribute to fairly strong consumer demand. Imports will fall slightly in 2019-20 all the same, reflecting lower global crude prices (Nigeria imports almost all its petrol requirement). As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise, imports will then grow faster.
Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will average 1.7% of GDP in 2019-20, widening to 2.3% of GDP in 2021-23 as oil prices strengthen and the new refinery comes on stream.

Abstract: Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had three broad centre-left/centre-right governments. [...]the administration has approved a new anti-corruption law, as well as a security decree containing a series of tougher policing and immigration measures, and a growth decree intended to jump-start business activity. EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The March 2018 general election produced a badly fragmented parliament. It also yielded a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won about 33% of the vote, and the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic Lega, which secured about 17%. Following tortuous government-formation talks, which almost ended inconclusively, at end-May the two parties agreed to form a government, led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent.
Mr Conte and his technocratic minister of the economy, Giovanni Tria, have experienced tensions with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, and Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader, both of whom serve as deputy prime ministers. Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini are the de facto political leaders of the government, which The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to complete a five-year term, ending in 2023. Amid a slowing economy and a resounding victory at the European Parliament elections, we believe that Mr Salvini is likely to press for an early election in late 2019. The soonest feasible date for a snap election would be sometime in early 2020.
The government will continue to prioritise tougher stances on migration and more defiant positions on EU rules, as well as the disarming of so-called safeguard clauses in the country's fiscal framework that would raise indirect taxes from 2020 if other consolidation measures are not approved. The government is also implementing means-tested "citizenship income" and is planning a "growth decree" to support the economy.
Following a protracted dispute with the European Commission over its draft 2019 budget plan, the government narrowly avoided the launch of an excessive-deficit procedure in early July. Tensions are likely to increase during the 2020 budget process, however, as the Lega is demanding the implementation of a costly "flat" income tax proposal, and the Commission believes that Italy is non-compliant with its rules on public debt reduction.
We expect Italian real GDP to stagnate in 2019, growing by just 0.1%. Risks to this forecast are balanced to the downside. This is likely to put this year's revised fiscal deficit target of 2% of GDP out of reach. Weaker economic growth and a wider deficit also mean that the government's goal of lowering the government debt/GDP ratio from 132.4% at end-2018 is unlikely to be achieved. Our core forecast for growth in 2020-23 is also weak, owing to slowing momentum both domestically and in the euro area. We forecast real GDP growth of 0.4% in 2020 and about 1.1% on average in 2021-23.

Italy's business environment score improves modestly in the 2019-23 forecast period. Reforms since 2012 have helped to raise the scores for foreign investment, financing and the labour market. Some of these will be reversed or diluted.
Country forecast overview: Italy's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Significant reforms to improve competition will not be a priority under the administration led by Giuseppe Conte.
2021-23: Improvements in competition policy will depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Modest reductions in red tape. Government plans to charge penalties to foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2021-23: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. The Conte government could oppose new EU trade deals. EU focuses on EU-UK trade deal in Brexit negotiations, further bilateral free-trade deals and responding to US tariffs.
2021-23: An EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive. The risk of a euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to leave the bloc in the medium term.
Taxes
2019-20: Automatic rise in value-added tax (VAT) rate is averted in 2019, but implementation of two-rate "flat tax" is delayed owing to cost. Reduction in tax expenditure and some tax rises in order to finance costly social spending plans.
2021-23: Government seeks to implement a diluted corporate and income tax-reduction package.
Financing
2019-20: Bank mergers, recapitalisations and non-performing loan sales are slow, not least given political uncertainty.
2021-23: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market
2019-20: Firms remain reluctant to increase open-ended contract payrolls. Universal unemployment benefit or "citizenship income" may be partly introduced. Some aspects of 2014-15 labour market reforms will be reversed.
2021-23: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Lack of fiscal space constrains government plans for higher investment spending.
2021-23: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) presses for further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keep research and development (R&D) spending low.
2021-23: Gradually improving economic prospects, as well as Brexit, encourage more information and communications technology graduates to seek work in Italy. Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had three broad centre-left/centre-right governments. Matteo Renzi's resignation as prime minister after his flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum in December 2016 led to the formation of a government led by Paolo Gentiloni, a close ally of Mr Renzi. Following the 2018 general election an M5S-Lega government was formed.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December 2016 referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house). A new, predominantly proportional, electoral system was adopted in October 2017.
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which stood at 132.2% of GDP in 2018), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process has since stalled, and the M5S-Lega government will seek to loosen fiscal policy, stimulate private consumption through tax cuts and income support to low earners, and seek to reverse or dilute recent pension and labour reforms.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes are levied, including the regional business tax (IRAP), to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.5%, reduced from 3.9% in 2014. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$537.5bn in 2018, and imports (fob) were worth US$481.9bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$50.6bn, or 2.4% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Slightly more than a year into its five-year term, the coalition government composed of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the far-right Lega is showing signs of strain. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the leader of the Lega, Matteo Salvini, will trigger a political crisis, but probably not until later this year, when frictions with M5S and with the EU surrounding the 2020 budget will provide an opportunity to withdraw from the coalition. The president, Sergio Mattarella, would have limited options but to grant Mr Salvini-who tops opinion polls-an early election, but such a vote will probably only be held in the first half of 2020. At this contest we expect the Lega to win a commanding majority in parliament at the head of a right-wing coalition, including the centre-right Forza Italia and the small, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia.
The coalition-led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent law professor-came into office in the wake of the March 2018 general election, at which M5S won 33% of the vote and the Lega won 17%. Since then, however, the Lega has dominated the government under the leadership of Mr Salvini (a deputy prime minister and minister of the interior) who has struck a chord with Italian voters, with his round-talking speeches, adept use of social media and a policy agenda focused on security issues, Euroscepticism and combating illegal immigration.
Meanwhile M5S's popularity has ebbed steadily under the leadership of Luigi Di Maio, also a deputy prime minister, and the minster of labour and economic development. Following disappointing performances in a series of regional and local elections in 2018-19 M5S won just 17% of the vote at the European Parliament elections, compared with the Lega's 34%.
In early July, following weeks of tensions with the European Commission, the government managed to evade a debt-based excessive-deficit procedure (EDP) by adopting measures intended to reduce the 2019 budget deficit by EUR7.6bn, to 2% of GDP (compared with a previous target of 2.4%). Nonetheless, tensions between the government and EU institutions are likely to resume regarding the draft 2020 budget in October. The drafting process in the weeks before the submission will be challenging, given the divisions within the government coalition and the need to disarm the so-called safeguard clauses written into the country's multi-year fiscal framework. This would raise the headline value-added tax (VAT) rate from an already high 22% to 25.2%, if EUR23bn (1.3% of GDP) is not raised through spending cuts or from other revenue sources. The Lega's landslide win at the European Parliament elections has emboldened Mr Salvini, who is determined to have his costly flat-tax reform-thus far applied only to lower- and middle-income VAT-account holders-extended to the personal income of all citizens in the next budget. This time the Commission may adopt a tougher line, as it will not have European Parliament elections looming. Against this backdrop, a combination of financial market pressures, electoral opportunism on Mr Salvini's behalf and political pressure from EU institutions are expected to cause the government to unravel, paving the way for a snap election in 2020.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The next parliamentary election is scheduled for early 2023, but we expect it to be held much sooner. Mr Salvini will probably try to capitalise on his party's gains in support by pulling the plug on the administration. Such a move would be an attempt to force Mr Mattarella to call a snap general election if he cannot find an alternative governing majority in parliament.
The result of the European Parliament elections has raised the likelihood that such a break will happen late this year. When combined with the Lega's vote share of 34%, those of Forza Italia (9%) and Fratelli d'Italia (6%) come to about 50%, which would be likely to produce a commanding majority under Italy's voting law for general elections. This system, the so-called Rosatellum 2, allocates about one-third of the seats in each house of parliament in single-member districts and about two-thirds via proportional representation.
It is possible that M5S and the centre-left opposition party, Partito Democratico (PD)-having reclaimed its place as the second most popular party in the context of the May European Parliament elections, surpassing M5S with a vote share of 23%-will align in the event of a government crisis in order to avert an election over the near term that returns a right-wing government. However, the parliamentary mathematics would be difficult, particularly in the Senate (the upper house of parliament), and the two parties would struggle to justify such a move to their respective electorates.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
We expect Italy to remain a member of the EU and the euro zone during the 2019-23 forecast period. Other foreign policy mainstays-including a close relationship with the US, and membership of NATO and the UN-will also continue. However, relations are likely to be strained. Mr Salvini has signalled a more confrontational stance towards other EU countries, taking a tough line on migration measures and has also protested against EU fiscal constraints.
Sino-Italian diplomatic relations will improve in the near term, following Italy's decision to sign in late March a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. The MoU is unlikely to increase bilateral trade or investment flows significantly in 2019-23, but it will probably undermine EU attempts to find a common stance on China, and complicate Italy's relations with other EU countries and the US.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The M5S-Lega administration has departed from the more orthodox policies of previous governments. With regards to the labour market, the administration passed the so-called Dignity Decree in July 2018, reversing parts of the 2015 Jobs Act, a liberalising labour market reform. In April 2019 the government implemented an expansionary pension reform, easing the conditions for early retirement.
One of the administration's other flagship policies, M5S's citizenship income, provides a monthly stipend or top-up of other benefits, including EUR780 for poor pensioners and the unemployed. For working-age people, the citizenship income effectively functions in the same way as a means-tested jobseeker's allowance and has been paired with enhanced active labour market policies.
The government has also implemented a first step towards the Lega's promised 15% flat income tax, applying this rate to VAT-account holders earning up to EUR65,000 beginning in January 2019. Finally, the administration has approved a new anti-corruption law, as well as a security decree containing a series of tougher policing and immigration measures, and a growth decree intended to jump-start business activity.
The coalition's anti-reformist rhetoric and its open resistance to EU fiscal rules have rattled the markets. The banking sector also remains weak and highly exposed to government debt, which totals EUR2.3trn. However, credit quality has improved rapidly in the past two years, owing to regulatory pressures from the European Central Bank (ECB) to reduce stocks of bad loans on banks' balance sheets, as well as the rescue and restructuring of several troubled lenders.
Nonetheless, an abrupt uptick in market perceptions of political risk could still pose challenges to financial stability. We believe it is unlikely that Italy will lose market access in 2019-23. However, owing to the sheer size of Italy's public debt stock and the fragility its banks, the economy would be too large to rescue without support from the ECB in the event of a large-scale crisis.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
On July 1st the government adopted measures intended to reduce the 2019 budget deficit by EUR7.6bn, to 2% of GDP, compared with a previous target of 2.4%. The EUR7.6bn correction includes an adjustment of EUR6.1bn contained in the "budget-balancing" law, comprising EUR6.2bn from higher than projected revenue (about half from larger tax revenue and social security contributions, and half from higher dividend payments from government stakes in the Bank of Italy-the central bank-and the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, a state-controlled investment bank that manages postal savings), as well as a net spending overshoot of EUR100m. The government has introduced a decree to freeze EUR1.5bn (0.08% of GDP) in unused budget funds that was earmarked to cover the cost of relaxing the 2011 reform of early pension requirements and the citizenship income-the administration's ambitious plan to fight poverty.
Given the distinct risk of higher outlays than expected, we believe that this objective is implausible and expect a budget shortfall of 2.5% of GDP in 2019. The 2020 budget process, which will begin with an update to the government's fiscal and economic projections in late September, and the submission of a draft budgetary plan to the European Commission in mid-October, is likely to prove to be exceptionally difficult. The deficit is then expected to expand further, to 2.8% of GDP in 2020, and to an average of about 2.6% in 2021-23. Public debt, at 132.2% of GDP at end-2018, is expected to remain near this level for the next five years.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB adopted a remarkably accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below; it also launched a EUR2.6trn quantitative easing (QE) programme in 2015, which it concluded in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the forecast period, as the ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening. Euro zone inflationary pressures remain low, and there are pronounced downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook. At its meeting on June 6th the ECB adopted a dovish stance, delaying the next rate rise from early 2020 until mid-2020 at the earliest. This was in line with our existing forecast; we expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate in June 2020 and the main refinancing rate in December 2020, with policy tightening proceeding thereafter at a gradual pace. The bank also announced that the interest rate on its third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III) could go as low as -0.3%, to encourage lending. Should economic conditions deteriorate further, for instance given an escalation in the US-China trade war or a "no-deal" Brexit (not our core forecast), we would expect the ECB to resume its QE programme or to cut rates once again.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
In full-year 2018 real GDP expanded by 0.7%, down from 1.8% in 2017. Momentum was weak going into 2019, dampened by domestic political and economic uncertainty, as well as global trade tensions. In January-March 2019 the economy expanded by 0.1% (compared with the previous three months). This followed two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and resulted in a first-quarter contraction of 0.1% year on year. We expect that the economy will expand by a marginal 0.1% in full-year 2019, on the back of slower growth in private consumption and fixed investment, and less favourable external conditions. High-frequency indicators for the first half of 2019 paint a mixed picture, suggesting that the recovery from recession is fragile and could falter in the coming quarters.
Economic growth will remain subdued in 2020, at 0.4%. In that year the building effects of the ongoing US-China trade dispute, and weaker growth in the US, will weigh on the external sector and dampen sentiment. Growth should then pick up to an average of 1.1% per year in real terms in 2021-23 as domestic and global demand recover.
The boost to real household disposable income from recent tax cuts has faded, with real private consumption-accounting for about 60% of GDP-growing only modestly, by 0.6% in full-year 2018. Consumer spending also weakened as a result of heightened volatility in financial markets in the final two quarters of 2018, which weighed on consumer confidence, and it may wane in the second half of this year as political tensions with EU institutions mount. We expect weak job creation, modest wage growth and waning consumer confidence to continue to constrain household spending in 2019. After meagre expansions of 0.4% per year on average in 2019-20, we forecast that consumer spending will rise to about 1% per year in 2021-23 as domestic sentiment improves.
Public consumption rose by 0.2% in 2018, and we expect looser spending controls and limited fiscal stimulus efforts to result in a slight uptick in 2019-23. It will remain modest, however, at an annual average rate of 0.5% throughout this period. The current administration's looser stance towards deficit spending will raise the risk of higher levels of government consumption.
Fixed investment expanded for the fourth consecutive year in 2018, but was still more than one-fifth below its 2007 pre-crisis level. It rose by 3.2% in real terms last year, driven by transport-equipment spending in the first half of the year, as well as a slow recovery in construction. In 2019-20 investment growth will slow significantly, to an annual average of 1.2%, held back by the expiration of tax incentives, policy uncertainty and declining sentiment, as well as public capital spending constraints, still impaired credit channels and relatively high levels of corporate debt.
The pace of export growth decreased markedly in 2018, to 1.4%. Export growth is expected to remain weak in 2019-20, owing in particular to weaker growth in EU markets and global trade tensions, before picking up thereafter. Anaemic domestic demand growth and external demand constraints will also constrain import growth to less than 2% in 2019-22, before stronger export performance and healthier domestic demand lead to firmer expansion in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2018, at 1.2%, as a 0.2% decline in core inflation (headline inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices) more than offset inflationary pressures that stemmed from a 30.7% increase in international oil prices and a rise in global food prices for the first time in seven years.
In 2019 consumer price growth should slow further, to 0.9%, owing to cheaper average global energy prices and still considerable slack in the labour market, meaning that upward pressure on prices from capacity constraints will not materialise in the near term. A positive demand shock from fiscal policy also appears unlikely. In 2020 headline inflation should increase slightly, driven by a forecast 4.8% increase in global food prices, which will offset downward pressures deriving from declining global energy prices. From 2020 inflation should recover gradually, to average 1.4% in 2021-23, as global energy prices rise.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of QE tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:EUR1-US$1.14:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weaker euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable throughout the year, reflecting investors' concerns about Brexit and a further deterioration in US-EU trade relations. After averaging US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019, the euro should pick up more substantially in 2020, to US$1.18:EUR1, as these risks abate, momentum in the euro zone recovers and the ECB takes steps to tighten policy. The currency will rebound further in 2021-23, to US$1.23:EUR1, underpinned by the euro zone's large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
In 2018 the current account remained firmly in surplus, at 2.4% of GDP. We expect it to average 1.5% in 2019-23. This decline reflects considerably slower growth in export revenue until 2021, in line with slower global demand. Higher international energy prices in 2021-23 will have a negative effect on the trade balance in those years (Italy is a major energy importer).

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In a snap general election held on July 7th 2019 the main centre-right opposition party, New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recorded a comfortable victory over the left-wing ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) led by Alexis Tsipras. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the single-party ND government will provide the basis for more stable and effective administration, but that it will struggle with the multiple challenges inherited from Mr Tsipras's administration.
Greece will remain under "enhanced supervision" by euro zone creditors during the forecast period (2019-23) and beyond, until its huge public debt of more than 180% of GDP is substantially reduced. We do not expect Greece's creditors to allow the new government to renegotiate the annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter in order to adopt more growth-friendly policies of tax cuts. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet the ambitious budget targets.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, it will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
After expanding by 1.9% in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to reach 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and an annual average of about 2.1% in 2021-23. Meeting large primary budget surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove difficult. Public debt is forecast to remain high, at about 175% of GDP in 2023.
Inflation (EU harmonised) will remain subdued, rising slightly-from 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 0.9% in 2019-20-reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and weaker global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to rise, bringing inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect narrow current-account deficits in 2019-23, compared with an annual average of 7.1% of GDP since 2001, when Greece joined the euro zone.

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period, with progress in almost all categories apart from political stability. However, Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions, which will constrain real GDP growth and keep Greece's debt burden high.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The new government seeks to revive the country's privatisation programme, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover about two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs to end-2020.
2021-23: Significant risk of Greece leaving euro zone in long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point-of-sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. Private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA), but ND returned to power in July 2019 and XA failed to win enough votes to enter parliament.
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% (29% in 2018) and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to 2.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In a snap general election held on July 7th 2019, three months before the end of the parliamentary term, the main centre-right opposition party, New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recorded a comfortable victory over the left-wing ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) led by Alexis Tsipras. ND obtained 39.85% of the national vote, which, along with a 50-seat bonus awarded to the party with the most votes, gave Mr Mitsotakis's party 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament.
The new government is the first single-party government since the start of the Greek crisis nearly a decade ago, which should provide the basis for a more stable and effective government. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects the new administration to struggle with the multiple challenges inherited from Mr Tsipras's administration, not least reassuring Greece's international creditors that ND's programme of tax cuts will not jeopardise the country's route to debt sustainability. This task has been made harder by the fiscal loosening that the outgoing Tsipras government pursued in the run-up to the elections this year. As a result, the new government, which is subject to strict policy conditionality under the EU's enhanced surveillance regime, will have limited room for manoeuvre to change course to a more growth-friendly policy mix. We also remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise to much more than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, further hindering the new government's ability to reduce Greece's public debt of more than 180% of GDP to a more sustainable level.
During his time in power since 2015 Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support, despite taking Greece out of the third bail-out programme in August 2018 after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms. Nevertheless, Syriza performed better than might have been expected in the general election, winning 31.53% of the vote and 86 seats (compared with 35.5% in the September 2015 general election). This should be sufficient to ensure that Mr Tsipras maintains the leadership of the party. If the party remains united, it should provide strong opposition to the ND government.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The next general election is not due until mid-2023, when Greece will also hold local, regional and European Parliament elections. In early 2020 parliament is due to elect the next president, who has a mostly ceremonial role. The incumbent, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, was elected on February 18th 2015. The current election procedure requires a minimum three-fifths majority (180 out of 300 members of parliament) in the third round of voting to elect the president, otherwise a fresh general election must be called. An amendment to abolish this provision was approved by an enhanced majority in the previous parliament, so the presidential election now only requires a simple majority the second time around. Another constitutional amendment to repeal the electoral reform introduced by Syriza (that abolished the 50-seat bonus awarded to the party winning the most votes in the general election) will, however, require a three-fifths majority in the new parliament. If ND cannot muster enough support, the restoration of the 50-seat bonus will not take effect until the general election after the next one-in other words in 2027.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability, as well as protracted economic and financial crises, has limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans, but in its final phase, the Syriza government made successful efforts to restore influence on the international scene, including the Macedonia name-change deal, which was ratified in January 2019, and talks on closer co-operation with the US. The name-change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Northern Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership. ND opposed ratification of the deal, but Mr Mitsotakis has said that he would only seek to renegotiate it if Northern Macedonia agreed.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey will persist. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programme in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line but with a substantial cash buffer to use while the government builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover the country's financing needs until end-2020. However, this will be more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. Intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the Syriza government to choose the more expensive option.
Nevertheless, severe policy constraints will remain during the forecast period and beyond, until Greece's huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was about 182% of GDP at end-2018, and also predominantly owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance is subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries.
The implementation of further debt-relief measures also agreed with Greece's EU creditors in June 2018 will be conditional on quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments, the most pressing of which include tackling Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, reviving the government's privatisation programme, removing remaining capital controls and clearing state arrears to the private sector. Greece has also committed to long-term fiscal prudence with annual primary budget surplus targets (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter until 2060. As the quarterly reviews will be published (the most recent was released in June 2019), transgression by Greece could adversely affect market access. The debt-relief measures include a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). Greece will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2019-22.
In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing requirements, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. After a three-year absence Greece has tapped the financial markets five times since July 2017, most recently in early March 2019 with a well-subscribed ten-year issue, yielding 3.9%. The spread on the secondary market between Greek ten-year government bonds and equivalent German government bonds has narrowed steadily in recent months, to about 260 basis points in mid-July. However, any signs of tensions between the new government and its international creditors, for example over Greece's primary budget surplus targets (ND has suggested that they could be renegotiated lower to create fiscal room for tax cuts) or an increase in risk aversion in the global financial markets, could cause Greek yields to rise again sharply.
In the medium and long term, the political and-arguably-economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. In the past four years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness in the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In 2018, after almost a decade of austerity, Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 1.1% of GDP and a primary surplus of close to 4.5%, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 3.5%. From 2019, however, we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits from 2020 and primary surpluses falling short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint in 2019 ahead of elections and only moderate economic growth. There is also uncertainty about the application of the Council of State's ruling that previous pension and bonus cuts implemented in 2016 were unconstitutional, raising the risk of retroactive payments. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-18 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be about 175% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below; it also launched a EUR2.6trn quantitative easing (QE) programme in 2015, which it concluded in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the 2019-23 forecast period, as the ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening. Euro zone inflationary pressures remain low, and there are pronounced downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook. At its meeting on June 6th the ECB adopted a dovish stance, delaying the next rate rise from early 2020 until mid-2020 at the earliest. This was in line with our existing forecast; we expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate in June 2020 and the main refinancing rate in December 2020, with policy tightening proceeding thereafter at a gradual pace. The bank also announced that the interest rate on its third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III) could go as low as -0.3%, to encourage lending. Should economic conditions worsen, for instance given an escalation in the US-China trade war or a "no-deal" Brexit (not our core forecast), we would expect the ECB to resume its QE programme or to cut rates again.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The Greek economy is recovering from a protracted slump, but the recovery is modest and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. As at 2018 real GDP was still more than 25% below pre-crisis levels; meanwhile government consumption remained almost a quarter lower, household consumption one-fifth lower and gross fixed investment almost two-thirds lower. Real GDP accelerated from 1.4% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final three months of last year, contracting by 0.1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained, at 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and at an annual average of about 2.1% in 2021-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector, and political and financial market instability.
A combination of more-and higher-taxes, larger social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts will continue to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2019-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 12% year on year in 2018. We expect a pick-up from this year, to an annual average of 5.2% in 2019-23. Underinvestment during the economic crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively small, uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.6% in 2019-23, down from 8.7% in 2018. However, the Greek tourism sector faces considerable challenges, including the UK's planned departure from the EU, increased competition from Turkey and insufficient public investment.
How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country remains in the euro zone. Although the risk of Grexit has abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and sharp decreases in global oil prices in the final quarter of 2018 will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect inflation to rise modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 0.9% per year in 2019-20 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of QE tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:EUR1-US$1.14:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weaker euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable throughout the year, reflecting investors' concerns about Brexit and a further deterioration in US-EU trade relations. After averaging US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019, the euro should pick up more substantially in 2020, to US$1.18:EUR1, as these risks abate, momentum in the euro zone recovers and the ECB takes steps to tighten policy. The currency will rebound further in 2021-23, to US$1.23:EUR1, underpinned by the euro zone's large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports due to contracting domestic demand, but also partly because of improved competitiveness, particularly in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2019-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. [...]we expect a 1.7% contraction in real GDP in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018, in the first round of a snap presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected to a second term. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond. The concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament suggest that policy will retain an element of unpredictability.
Domestic and regional political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic.
The currency crisis in 2018 pushed the Turkish economy into a recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to have continued in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a full-year real GDP contraction of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
The currency crisis and recession will put pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets. In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance sheet trends will persist). This, and a recovering economy, will cause the budget deficit to narrow, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% of GDP in 2023.
The total population is projected to rise from 82.3m in 2018 to 86m in 2023, with the female population continuing to far outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by 0.9% per year during the 2019-23 forecast period, compared with growth of 1.6% in the historical period (2014-18).
The large consumer market is one of Turkey's main attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local-currency terms. We expect GDP per head to rise from US$9,285 at market exchange rates in 2018 to about US$11,631 in 2023.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2019-23), and its global ranking falls by 13 places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, inadequate policy responses to tighter global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse in 2018-19. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced, but evasion remains widespread.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018-19. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Mismatches between education and labour market needs persist.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election, a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled US$175bn and imports about US$216bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$41.8bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$27.1bn (or 3.5% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018, in the first round of a snap presidential election, Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected to a second term. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair; opposition candidates received little or no media coverage, the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison, and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. Demonstrating Mr Erdogan's determination to further augment and make use of his presidential powers, on July 6th he dismissed Murat Cetinkaya, the governor of the Central Bank of Turkey, and replaced him with one of the deputy governors, Murat Uysal. This contravenes the Central Bank Act, which gives the central bank a high level of independence.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023. However, Mr Erdogan and his AKP suffered a clear blow to their credibility when the opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, increased his margin of victory over Binali Yildirim of the ruling coalition in the Istanbul mayoral election rerun at end-June. Although this represents a major setback for Mr Erdogan, we expect him to keep a tight grip on national institutions and the media in order to continue his dominance of Turkish politics in the coming years.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to win more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections took place in March 2019. The AKP and the MHP retained a majority of the national vote. However, in the midst of an economic recession, the ruling parties lost vital cities such as Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city. Given the public resources that major cities command, Mr Erdogan and the AKP put huge pressure on the Supreme Election Council (YSK) to annul the Istanbul election result. But although the YSK ordered a rerun of the mayoral election, the opposition candidate won with 54% of the vote on June 23rd.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. We do not expect a collapse in relations, but this forecast is highly uncertain. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; and US sanctions on Turkish officials following Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October 2018). In 2019 relations with the US will continue to be tested owing to Turkey's decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system. The US and NATO believe that the S-400 system can gather sensitive information on NATO equipment, and in particular the F-35 stealth fighter jet. The incompatibility of the S-400 with NATO systems is a further issue.
So far Turkey has not bowed to US pressure to cancel the missiles purchase, and Russia began delivering the first parts of the S-400 missile defence system to Turkey in the week of July 8th. Although Turkey believes that this is a sovereign issue, backing down would also negative affect Turkey's relations with Russia, a significant ally of neighbouring Syria. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. A deterioration in relations could therefore jeopardise Turkey's control of the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. It could also limit Turkey's influence in Idlib, in northern Syria, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups. In September 2018 Turkey, Russia and Iran reached an agreement to forestall a regime offensive against Idlib. Such an attack could result in another surge of refugee flows into Turkey.
In the near term we expect the US to hold back on major sectoral sanctions under the US Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which targets countries buying military equipment from Russia, for fear of pushing Turkey towards Russia and Iran. Recent statements from Lindsey Graham, a senator of the US Republican Party, member of the caucus on US-Turkey relations and main ally of Donald Trump, the US president, suggest that the country will only incur sanctions if Turkey activates the S-400 missile defence system (expected in October 2019). However, Turkey is likely to discontinue its participation in the F-35 programme (Turkey has ordered F-35s and is a participant in the construction programme, providing key elements), which would cause delays; the cancellation of the F-35s' delivery would represent a setback for Turkey.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector and its dynamic and diversified private sector. We expect the currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession to put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets.
With the 2019 local elections having past, and as the next parliamentary and presidential elections are not due until mid-2023, the government is in a position to defuse domestic political tensions and take a more long-term approach to policymaking. This would help to revive investor confidence and foster sustainable economic growth, reversing the pattern of the past three years of ad hoc policy measures, which boosted the economy but exacerbated Turkey's macroeconomic imbalances and diminished the government's credibility. However, an element of unpredictability and unorthodoxy will remain. The economy is in recession and, following its recent poor performance in local elections, the AKP will continue to feel pressure to support growth. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in the 2019-23 forecast period. The removal of Mr Cetinkaya will add to the unpredictability of Turkey's policies, damaging financial market sentiment.
Should the recent currency crisis trigger a banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited. Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, which has tense relations with Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable given Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Only China appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey (perhaps as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Under the AKP, the public finances have been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax increases in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits caused the budget deficit to widen in 2018, to 2% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance-sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% of GDP in 2019 to 1.7% in 2023.
The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.9% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), in the context of economic turmoil after the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to about 26.6% by end-2023, as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, and the ensuing record rise in annual consumer price inflation. Subsequently, the lira staged an uneven recovery, and inflation fell to 15.7% at end-June, while economic performance remained weak. The bank has yet to start reducing rates-although it introduced a lower rate of 23% for limited amounts of lending to market-maker banks on June 17th.
We expect rate cuts totalling 3-5 percentage points in July-December, provided that further currency shocks occur and inflation continues to relent. The more dovish stance of the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) and major risks of cuts support our view. In 2021-23 we believe that the central bank will continue to overshoot its inflation target of 5% owing to the government's continued pro-growth stance, putting pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to reach its inflation target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2017 (from 3.3% in 2016), but this surge exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the central bank's independence, reliance on short-term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018, which continued in the first months of 2019. As a result, we expect a 1.7% contraction in real GDP in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 4.1% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.6% per year. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts: these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices drove inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually in the second half, on the back of positive baseline effects, the appreciation of the lira, a lower average global oil price, continuing subdued consumer demand and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2019 will prevent inflation from declining faster than would otherwise be the case. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.1% in 2019-only marginally slower than in 2018.
We expect inflation to decelerate rapidly in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 10.2% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.4% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of 2018. In March-May 2019 the lira again depreciated against the US dollar owing to political uncertainty and polarising campaign rhetoric around the March local elections, declining central bank foreign-exchange reserves, the re-emergence of tensions with the US and the rerun of the Istanbul mayoral race following the AKP's defeat.
The lira again surpassed TL6:US$1 in early May but started appreciating again in June. We expect the lira to oscillate around its level of about TL5.70:US$1 throughout the second half of the year. This forecast rests on our expectation that the Turkey-US dispute will not result in damaging sectoral sanctions but rather only in individual sanctions at most, that government policy will be credibly reoriented, and that the central bank will lower interest rates only as price pressures fade. There are high risks to this forecast, both in terms of probability and impact. If any of our expectations do not materialise, the lira could again depreciate substantially.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to depreciate in line with a widening of the current-account deficit. Thereafter still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although smaller than in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to near TL6.4:US$1 by end-2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect the current-account deficit to narrow as a share of GDP in 2019, to 0.7% (a 16-year low), from 3.5% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2017, as the lira's depreciation against the US dollar and the euro depresses imports (owing to a decline in domestic demand) and boosts export competitiveness. From 2020 we expect the deficit to widen gradually, to a still relatively moderate 3.3% per year on average in 2020-23. The narrower deficits compared with historical levels reflect significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018-19 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Full text: Brazil--highlights: Political outlook
The right-wing government of president Jair Bolsonaro lacks a majority in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress (featuring 30 parties in the lower house) and does not intend to build a formal coalition of parties as is customary. Negotiations with Congress will prove challenging, but will advance where there is a common agenda with centrist parties, such as on pension reform and tax simplification. Mr Bolsonaro's conservative social and law and order reforms will experience pushback, sustaining tensions with the legislature. His government is also subject to internal tensions owing to the fight for power between an ideological wing and a number of more pragmatic former military officials appointed to the cabinet.

The last government improved the business environment during 2016-18, and the Bolsonaro government will also bring advances in 2019-23, particularly in foreign trade (lower barriers and a EU-Mercosul FTA deal); policy towards foreign investment and private enterprise; and competition, owing to privatisations and more certain rules of the game. Brazil's large economy is attractive. But poor government effectiveness, a burdensome tax system (despite good prospects for some simplification), rickety infra-structure (notwithstanding improvements through concessions), deficiencies in factor markets and skills shortages will continue to impair business. Pension reform will buoy the public finances and help keep interest rates and inflation lower than before, bolstering macroeconomic stability.

The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the tepid recovery in 2017-19 from Brazil's brutal 2014-16 recession to gather momentum in 2020-23 aided by confidence-boosting pension and tax reforms and more business-friendly policies. Fiscal consolidation will halt the rise in the public debt/GDP ratio and will allow for lower interest rates and inflation, boosting private credit. However, absent the fiscal driver, GDP growth will be more reliant on the private sector. High unemployment will dampen consumption. Investment will recover somewhat, helped by infrastructure concessions and privatisations. The current-account deficit will widen but the external sector will pose few risks, buoyed by a large reserves cushion.

The rate of population growth will fall to 0.6% in 2019-23. But this growth rate will remain above the world average and well above Western European rates. The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries, and the rise in the number of people of working age will outpace population growth as a whole. However, in the longer term, Brazil's demographic dynamics will deteriorate, heightening pressure on the pension system.

Brazil is Latin America's largest market, the world's fifth-most populous country and the eight -largest economy, offering huge investment opportunities. But GDP growth and loans to households will be weaker in the forecast period than during the boom in 2004-10, softening income gains and private consumption. Deepening capital markets will boost credit availability for businesses. It will be difficult to replicate the gains achieved in the decade preceding the 2014-16 recession in reducing income inequality, (reflecting job creation in low-skilled sectors, rises in the minimum wage and cash transfer programmes), in an environment of tepid GDP growth and fiscal constraints.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Our long-term growth forecast anticipates annual average GDP growth to 2050 of 1.9%. Improvements in infrastructure and education, trade expansion, a broader presence of multinational business, and the development of huge oil reserves will mitigate slower labour force growth and help to sustain labour productivity growth. If improvements in policymaking and the business environment were to exceed expectations, growth rates would be higher. For many years, performance will continue to fluctuate with commodity cycles, as agriculture and natural resource extraction continue to play an important role in the economy. Climate change will crimp agricultural growth, despite technological advances to make crops resistant to warmer temperatures.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent over a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Dilma Rousseff (2011-16) nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer, finished her term (December 2018). Jair Bolsonaro, of the right-wing Partido Social Liberal, won the October 2018 presidential election and took office in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to frustrate the executive. Thirty political parties are represented in the lower house, and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: Brazil's 1988 constitution established benefits and entitlements that have contributed to a doubling in central government spending since then, to over 20% of GDP. Congress has approved a federal spending cap and is expected to approve complementary social security reforms to stop the rise in the public debt/GDP ratio (nearly 80% currently) caused by undisciplined fiscal policies and the impact of economic recession under the administration of Ms Rousseff. The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate from 14.25% in October 2016 to 6.5% in March 2018. The new Bolsonaro administration espouses free-market economic policies and privatisations.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system, characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect taxation systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: Recession and a weaker currency have led to import compression, supporting trade surpluses in recent years. The current-account deficit was 0.8% of GDP in 2018, which is modest.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Brazil is a federal republic, composed of 26 states and the capital district of Brasília, each with its own legislature and administration. Jair Bolsonaro of the right-wing Partido Social Liberal (PSL) took office in January 2018 for a four-year team after winning the October 2018 elections. In a break from the past, he is trying to govern without a formal, multi-party coalition and picked few party politicians for his reduced cabinet, which features a sprinkling of retired military officers. This poses governability risks given that Congress is highly fragmented (30 parties in the lower house) and that the ruling PSL only has 10% of the seats in the lower house. Mr Bolsonaro is seeking cross-party support for his socially conservative and liberal economic policy agenda. There is some support for his government's liberal economic policies from centrist parties that have formed a bloc, known as the Centrão, which wields considerable influence. But there is limited support for the rest of his agenda from centrist parties, including on conservative social policies and law and order, where he espouses a relaxation in gun control. Left-leaning parties in opposition to the government on both social and economic issues, have under 30% of the lower house seats.
Next elections: Presidential, congressional and state elections (every four years) are due in October 2022. Municipal elections will be held in October 2020.

Political outlook: Political stability
The president, Jair Bolsonaro of the right-wing Partido Social Liberal (PSL), who began office with a strong mandate, will face similar governability problems that have plagued previous administrations. With 30 parties represented, Congress will prove as unwieldy as ever, and on top of this Mr Bolsonaro will face challenges keeping the disparate factions of his own political movement together. The president has had a tumultuous first six months in office amid political infighting, strained relations with parties in Congress (even those allied with his economic agenda) and still-weak economic performance. His popularity has declined sharply-a poll by local polling firm Ibope put his approval ratings at only 32% in late June. He has nonetheless taken some pragmatic steps to try to bolster governability as Congress debates a pension bill, which is a key part of his agenda of liberal economic reforms. The pension legislation is currently being reviewed by a special commission in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). The Economist Intelligence Unit attaches a 75% probability that a version of the reform that will satisfy markets' view of Brazil's creditworthiness will be approved by October. The main risks to this assumption are political and surrounds the possibility of delays amid simmering tensions between the executive and Congress.
Mr Bolsonaro remains broadly reluctant to negotiate with the myriad parties in Congress as he continues his anti-establishment campaign rhetoric, criticising the "old-style politics" under which deals between Congress and the executive often involved patronage, "pork-barrel" politics and horse-trading that contributed to pervasive corruption. This has antagonised many parties in Congress, who have dealt the government legislative defeats on some minor bills. Faced with their congressional resistance, Mr Bolsonaro met with party leaders in April and it seems he may well, after all, offer some posts to their members in the state apparatus. The government is also likely to offer legislators additional funds for pet projects in their constituencies. In another pragmatic move, which bodes well for governability, in late May Mr Bolsonaro met with Rodrigo Maia (Democratas), the leader of the lower house (and therefore a key ally for Mr Bolsonaro's reform agenda) and the leader of the Senate (the upper house), Davi Alcolumbre, as well as the Supreme Court president, Dias Toffoli, to discuss a governability pact to advance a common reform agenda.
However, the potential for political infighting and tensions with most political parties to spill over and block reforms persists in the short term. Not only is Mr Bolsonaro himself an impulsive figure, he also faces challenges in managing strains between different groups vying for power in the government that he has assembled. These include his sons Flavio (a senator), Eduardo (a deputy) and Carlos (a local councillor, who is active on social media), who, together with PSL legislators in Congress, are pushing a right-wing ideological and socially conservative agenda. Another group comprises the economic team, led by Paulo Guedes, which espouses an ambitious structural reform and liberalisation agenda; and a third involves a handful of military figures in government, including the vice-president, who are playing a moderating role in foreign affairs and national security issues and see more of a role for state intervention in the economy.
Mr Bolsonaro's PSL and the leftist Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), which governed Brazil between 2003 and 2016, are the biggest parties in Congress, but with only around 10% of seats each in the lower house. Tension between the political right and left will be a feature of Mr Bolsonaro's term. However, common ground on economic policies with centrist parties will provide opportunities to advance economic reforms. Mr Bolsonaro's aloofness towards Congress and party leaders carries risks to governability; the president will only be effective if he remains popular enough with voters to retain congressional support for his reform agenda. Furthermore, there is a low risk that he may not finish his term in office-some legislators are even starting to call for his impeachment-although we assume that he will complete his term despite the political noise as there wouldn't be enough congressional support to start the process.
We assume that the president will be able to count on cross-party backing from three leading groups represented in Congress, known locally as the "bancada BBB" (the bala, boi, biblia-bullet, beef and bible-caucus), which includes law-and-order conservatives, socially conservative evangelical Christians (a large demographic) and agriculture-sector interests (who want to expand the production frontier). However, it will still be challenging to reach the three-fifths majority needed for constitutional amendments, such as will be required for pension reforms and tax simplification. Nor can he count on their support for all of his policies. Vested interests are pervasive in Congress, and many will resist privatisation, efforts to reduce tax breaks and subsidies for businesses, and measures affecting public-sector workers. On this basis we expect pension reform approval and tax simplification thereafter, as well as piecemeal progress on other pro-growth reforms.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Mr Bolsonaro faces governability problems similar to those that have plagued previous administrations. With 30 parties represented, Congress will prove as unwieldy as ever, and, on top of this, Mr Bolsonaro will face challenges keeping the disparate factions of his own political movement together. This is composed of an ideological right-wing group revolving around his three politically active sons, the president himself and the foreign minister; a military wing playing a moderating role in national security and public affairs, led by the vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, and the economic team revolving around Paulo Guedes and his radical, free-market agenda. Mr Bolsonaro remains reluctant to negotiate with the myriad parties in Congress as he continues his anti-establishment campaign rhetoric, criticising the "old-style politics" under which deals between Congress and the executive often involved patronage, and "give and take" horse-trading that contributed to pervasive corruption. But having been a legislator for nearly 30 years before coming to office, the president knows what makes them tick and he has a pragmatic side that will allow him to curry favour at important times (such as voting on pension reform) by offering legislators special budget allocations for pet projects in their constituencies-just the sort of "pork barrel" politics that he regularly criticises.
Mr Bolsonaro's nationalist populism, nostalgia for Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-85) and his cabinet appointments of several retired military officials sustain concerns in some quarters over whether he would potentially trample over Brazil's fairly young democratic institutions. This seems highly unlikely, but a drift towards authoritarianism cannot be entirely ruled out, particularly if Congress unexpectedly blocks his government agenda completely. Voters broadly support democracy (even though they are disillusioned by the record of parties in power) and would not acquiesce in the event of an unexpected shift to military rule, reducing the probability of such a scenario. Neither does the top military brass show any signs of wanting to overthrow the constitution and govern the country.
Political and institutional weakness persist
During 2015-18 three developments highlighted political and institutional weaknesses that continue to shape politics: a deep and wide-ranging corruption scandal; the impeachment of Ms Rousseff; and subsequent corruption investigations into her successor, Mr Temer. However, Brazil's institutions have held up well and constitutional order has been maintained. These developments generated a serious setback to confidence in Brazil's political system and helped to catapult Mr Bolsonaro to the presidency. Many of the issues remain unresolved and absent political reform (to reduce drastically the number of parties represented in Congress), there is little prospect of a meaningful "renewal", even though nearly 50% of the legislators elected to the lower house in October 2018 are freshmen. However, the decisive action and independence of the judiciary is a sign that Brazil is beginning to tackle endemic corruption. Companies, including Petrobras, are strengthening corporate governance mechanisms, which is positive.
Governments hampered by party fragmentation and weak coalitions
A key problem related both to government effectiveness and to corruption is the deep fragmentation of Congress, which encourages "pork barrel" politics. Since democracy was restored to Brazil in 1985 governments have struggled to hold together multi-party coalitions. Low voter-registration thresholds have contributed to a large number of parties (around 30 parties are represented in Congress), and their leaders behave opportunistically.
This dysfunctional system has become known as "presidential coalition" politics. Since 1985 two of the five directly elected presidents have been impeached by Congress-undermining the presidency and reflecting the powers of the legislature. To hold together a working majority, governments in the past have resorted to a range of legal but politically dubious pork barrel behaviours, such as offering ministerial positions, awarding spending programmes and constantly adjusting and diluting their legislative programmes to meet the demands of smaller parties and regional special interest groups. The other main course of action has been the use of illegal bribery schemes, effectively to buy votes in Congress and enforce the necessary coalition loyalty.
Major corruption schemes discredit the political system
Since 2003 several major corruption schemes have come to light. The so-called Petrolão scandal emerged in 2014, unearthed by a task force of pro-active federal prosecutors based in Curitiba who spearheaded the so-called "carwash" investigations. It involved private contractors, including some of Brazil's top construction companies, which formed illegal cartels to manipulate the allocation of multi-billion-dollar contracts with Petrobras, the state oil firm; a proportion of these unfairly secured contracts (usually 3%) was then paid out as illegal political party campaign contributions. The revelation in 2017 that Joesley Batista, the then chairman of the board of JBS, Brazil's largest meatpacking firm, was involved in widespread corruption with politicians suggests that the irregularities were more widespread. The scandal implicated Mr Temer and the federal prosecution sought to open a trial against the president, but his allies in Congress twice voted against stripping him of his presidential immunity from prosecution and blocked a trial. Most of the political establishment has been implicated in these corruption scandals, including not just the PT and the MDB, which was part of the ruling alliance with the PT for many years, but also members of the PSDB, including its losing candidate in the presidential race in 2014, Aécio Neves. In a landmark ruling, a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, (2003-10), was jailed for 12 years in April 2018 on a corruption conviction. Under the Bolsonaro administration, the tourism minister, Marcelo Álvaro Antônio (PSL), is being investigated for campaign finance irregularities by the police (he denies the charges). Leaked messages that surfaced in June 2019 raise questions about the impartiality of Sérgio Moro (who is now the minister of justice) when he was the judge in the "carwash" investigations, including that of Lula and others. The leaks suggest that he advised state prosecutors how to make the case against politicians, notably Lula.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next elections (for municipal posts) are scheduled for October 2020. As is customary in Brazilian politics, this gives the incoming government just one year to pass bold reforms, such as pension and tax reforms, before legislators become wary of passing controversial measures. The munici-pal elections will serve as a barometer for sentiment towards the new right-wing government. Should the economy pick up as forecast, Mr Bolsonaro would be in a reasonable position to run for re-election in 2022, but his controversial ideological views and poor leadership skills would probably prove a huge handicap for his chances. Rivals on the left will include Ciro Gomes (of the Partido Democrático Trabalhista) and possibly Fernando Haddad (PT). It is currently uncertain whether a competitive centrist candidate will emerge, who could prevent Mr Bolsonaro from making it to a second round (this would then pit Mr Bolsonaro against a leftist, in a repeat of the 2018 elections). The Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira, traditionally the larger of the centrist parties, will struggle to regroup; João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state, hopes to lead the party.
Political outlook: International relations
Under the anti-globalist foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, Mr Bolsonaro's presidency heralds changes in foreign policy that will have ripple effects across the region. It is being formulated as an antithesis to that of the PT governments of 2003-16, which curried favour with ideologically aligned, leftist governments in the region (including Cuba and Venezuela) and sought to gain geopolitical prominence through "South-South" co-operation among developing nations. Instead, policy will be more pro-Western, and, in particular, more closely aligned with the US. This was evident during Mr Bolsonaro's state visit to the US in March, when the US president, Donald Trump, pledged to support Brazil's membership of the OECD and make Brazil a major non-NATO ally. Mr Bolsonaro gave some trade concessions, but made few tangible gains on the trade front in return. Brazil's government now joins a group of other right-leaning administrations in the region-including Argentina, Colombia and Chile. A deal between the EU and Mercosur was announced at end-June, but ratification by EU governments will be a long process. The extent to which Mr Bolsonaro will cool Chinese investments in strategic energy and infrastructure areas (as he signalled he would during his campaign) remains uncertain. Any measures that could imperil Brazil's agro-exports to China would lead to pushback from the rural lobby that supports Mr Bolsonaro; moreover, his infrastructure concession and privatisation programme needs Chinese investment. Mr Bolsonaro sided with the US and other governments in no longer recognising Nicolás Maduro as the legitimate president in Venezuela. Despite the potential for a more hostile US-led approach to Venezuela, major Brazilian military intervention is unlikely, given that the military power group in government are opposed.

Brazil remains in the lower half of the business environment global ranking in the forecast period. Despite improvements in the overall score, Brazil slips in the global and regional rankings as other countries advance faster. Several categories register improvements over the forecast period, reflecting the Bolsonaro administration's liberal economic agenda, notably foreign trade and exchange controls (lower trade barriers), policy towards foreign investment and policy towards private enterprise (thanks to privatisation). There will be improvements in the labour market (greater flexibility) and infrastructure (through concessions and better rules of the game), although these will remain weaknesses.
More orthodox, market-oriented policies will help the recovery from crisis
After years of protectionism, the government intends to reduce trade barriers, with cuts in capital good and technology imports likely. Moreover, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the EU-Mercosul FTA deal announced in June 2019 to come into force later in the forecast period, potentially also encouraging other countries to engage Mercosul so as not to lose out to European companies. Brazil's large and diversified economy makes it attractive for investors and a resumption of growth after the brutal 2014-16 recession-albeit at modest rates of little above 2% in 2020-23-provides a boost. Brazil lost its investment-grade rating in 2015 and is unlikely to regain it for some time. Probable pension reform later this year will help curb the deterioration in fiscal and debt dynamics, but public debt/GDP will peak at a high level (nearly 85%). The political environment will remain another weakness, given a fragmented Congress. While the leftist opposition is weak and in a minority, powerful centrist parties are aligned with some aspects of the government's agenda, notably pension reform to bolster the public finances, and tax simplification, but are likely to resist some of the more radical, free-market measures espoused by Mr Bolsonaro's economy minister, Paulo Guedes. Corruption remains problematic, although companies are strengthening governance.

Business environment outlook: Brazil's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Supreme Court confirms that state-owned subsidiaries do not require legislative approval (only parent companies), facilitating ambitious privatisation agenda. Privatisation of Eletrobras (energy) is likely in 2020.
2021-23: Fiscal pressures open more room for private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment Partnerships Programme (PPI) advances with improved legal framework and regulatory agencies. Petrobras to relinquish control over natural gas market by 2021.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Foreign direct investment (FDI) boosted by PPI. Oil and gas attracts two thirds of FDI owing to huge pre-salt auction.
2021-23: Brazil's entry into the OECD boosts foreign investment. Yet, ideological issues within Bolsonaro's government put nationalist politics ahead of economic pragmatism in certain situations.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Despite anti-globalisation moves in advanced economies, some bilateral and regional trade negotiations advance.
2021-23: Steps to make the Brazilian Real a fully convertible currency. Ratification of EU-Mercosul FTA boosts market access.
Taxes
2019-20: The government's liberal orientation precludes fiscal adjustment via tax increases. But taxation on distributed profits and dividends is likely, if Congress approves the executive's proposals for corporate income tax cuts.
2021-23: Revenue-neutral tax simplification likely, unifying up to five taxes (federal, state and municipal) into one single value-added tax. Possible proposals, such as raising the individual income tax threshold and a financial transactions tax, are unlikely.
Financing
2019-20: Financial system to remain strong and liquid. The Banco Central do Brasil's (BCB, the central bank) microeconomic reform "BC+ Agenda" improves banking efficiency and competitiveness, reducing borrowing costs. Monetary easing and low inflation support a gradual rise in lending.
2021-23: Renewed growth in domestic equity and bond issuance as state banks dial back subsidised credit lines.
The labour market
2019-20: Unemployment remains high. Government implements additional measures to reduce the cost of labour.
2021-23: Steps to boost long-run labour productivity complicated by weaker education policies.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Infrastructure concessions to advance (through the PPI), but political and institutional constraints may cause delays.
2021-23: Incumbent construction companies hurt by corruption and recession leave greater room for newcomers, but their lack of experience causes project delays.
Technological readiness
2019-20: 5G frequencies auction held in March 2020. Quality of communication services improves as demand expands.
2021-23: Building of 5G infrastructure network to commence, but roll-out to consumers will be slow.

Brazil's performance will be weaker than that of other South American commodity exporters such as Chile, Peru and Colombia in the forecast period. Brazil´s recovery from a deep 2015-16 recession stumbled in 2018 amid electoral uncertainty and in January-June 2019 over pension reform approval.
Our baseline economic policy scenario-approval of a fiscally robust pension reform by October 2019-is subject to risks. This would pave the way for other productivity-enhancing reforms such as tax simplification and privatisation. Failure to approve pension reform would trigger a market sell-off over debt-sustainability concerns and take Brazil back into recession.
Fiscal consolidation means that the private sector will have to drive growth. Spare capacity, a weak labour market, and tepid international conditions are obstacles for renewed private investment, but infrastructure concessions and privatisations should provide a stimulus. Fiscal consolidation and fewer distortions in credit markets as the role of public banks is dialled back will contribute to lower interest rates and inflation than in the past. This should stimulate household credit and support business lending via a deepening of the local capital markets. Even so, Brazil's low savings rate means that the economy remains dependent on capital inflows for growth. FDI should perform reasonably well given the still-large market opportunities; portfolio flows will suffer from the global and US slowdown in 2020.

We expect improvements in policy towards private enterprise and competition, particularly with privatisations later in the forecast period. Economic and political factors are much better aligned now to favour privatisation than in the past. The fragile finances of many state companies (partly because of corruption) have increased support for liberal economic solutions, where privatisation is a key element. Many important sectors still face some degree of monopoly power from major state players, like oil and gas (Petrobras), energy (Eletrobras), post services and distribution (Correios) and, to a lesser degree, banking (Banco do Brasil, Caixa and BNDES). Even though broader privatisation of most of these state giants is unlikely, the selling of part of their assets and subsidiaries should advance. However, the highly liberal orientation coming from the Ministry of Economy under Paulo Guedes tends to run counter to other less market-friendly ministries and institutions, such as the executive bureaus run by former military officials (including the president), the Congress and sometimes even the Supreme Court.
Political and institutional constraints are the greatest source of risk for the evolution of the privatisation agenda. Government efforts will be focused on pension reform to the extent that the rest of its privatisation agenda will take a back seat until approval is attained. In this sense, the selling of state companies should be stronger in the second half of the forecast period.
Differing views between the Ministry of Economy and former military officials in executive posts, such as at the Ministry of Infrastructure, and Mining and Energy, may hinder the privatisation impetus of some state companies. Former military officials, including the president to some extent, still prefer national ownership of infrastructure assets. This means that many firms and agencies will be restructured to improve governance, rather than being divested.
Legislators view state-owned companies as an opportunity to exchange political support for lucrative posts. As Mr Bolsonaro has promised to refrain from "give and take" politics (and privatisation of parent companies still requires congressional approval), legislators may resist divestments to keep some power.
Another obstacle to privatisation is that the Supreme Court (STF) is a source of legal insecurity. Changes in interpretation of laws and injunctions by judges are common. The STF has shown an increasingly active role in arbitrating disputes involving the sale of state-owned enterprises. For example, the announced sale in April 2019 of TAG, a gas distributor and Petrobras subsidiary, to an international consortium, was initially suspended by one of the STF's 11 judges, but then went ahead after the plenary made a ruling in June stating that the executive could sell state-owned subsidiaries (but not parent companies) without legislative approval and without bidding-in a boost to privatisation.

Brazil ranks as one of the top 10 recipients of FDI globally and its score and global ranking improve. The government's pro-market orientation and the fiscal and governance crisis that have affected many local companies since 2014 create opportunities for higher participation of foreign capital in sectors such as transportation, logistics, power generation, sanitation, construction and housing, oil and gas, renewable energy and the airline industry. Brazil's probable entry into the OECD later in the forecast period will boost FDI.
Infrastructure concessions offer attractive opportunities
Recent successful infrastructure concessions examples include (i) the latest pre-salt auction held in September 2018, which attracted many foreign players, now that tenders for areas no longer require that Petrobras take a minimum 30% share (this delayed auctions as it did not have the capital)-rather, it now has an option to do so; (ii) the concession of 12 airports in three regional blocks in March 2019, which attracted national and international players in a very competitive bid and (iii) the sale of Embraer's commercial branch to Boeing. Moreover, the regulatory and legal framework has been continuously adapted to allow for a higher share of foreign funding in such assets. In mid-2019 Congress approved a presidential decree authorising aviation companies with headquarters in Brazil to have unlimited participation of foreign capital (previously limited to 20%).
Foreign investors are guaranteed national treatment by law, but restrictions apply to activities involving nuclear energy, mail and telegraph services (except parcel delivery), some aerospace activities (such as launching and deployment of satellites), acquisition or rental of rural property, media (including television networks, magazines, newspapers and radio broadcasting stations) and mining.
There is a risk that ideological factors will obstruct FDI from some countries. Mr Bolsonaro and some of his core supporters are more inclined to establish alliances with advanced western countries run by right-wing parties (like the US and some European countries) rather than countries under left-wing governments (like Mexico or China). During his election campaign, Mr Bolsonaro suggested some pushback in reference to the acquisition of energy assets, stating that, "The Chinese are not buying in Brazil, they are buying Brazil." It remains to be seen whether or not Mr Bolsonaro puts aside these ideological views in favour of economic pragmatism.

Brazil's score and rankings improve. The liberal agenda espoused by Mr Guedes involves opening the economy (exports and imports amount to 24% of GDP-Brazil is quite closed), removing or lowering existing barriers to imports, recovering the strategic importance of Mercosul (a customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) as a regional trading bloc and making the Brazilian Real fully convertible. We expect the landmark EU-Mercosul free-trade agreement (FTA) struck in June 2019 to be ratified by governments later in the forecast period. The deal may well encourage other countries to seek a deal with Mercosur so as not to lose market share to EU countries, including South Korea and Japan. But anti-globalisation movements in the developed world could pose some limits to FTAs between countries and regional blocs. Mr Bolsonaro's preference for dealing with countries whose leaders share his ideological beliefs rather than those with which Brazil has long-term diplomatic ties may hamper the country's future strategic trade efforts.
The conclusion of the EU-Mercosul FTA deal, after 20 years of on-off negotiation, sends a positive signal to investors and has significant economic upside for both blocs. It brings together a combined population of 780m people in an agreement that will eliminate nearly 100% of EU tariffs and 90% of Mercosur tariffs, assuming that a signed deal is ratified by all Mercosur and EU member parliaments. The ratification process will be politically complicated (resistance from farmers and environmental groups in countries like France pose a risk), and the FTA will probably not come into effect until 2021 at the earliest. For Brazil (and Argentina) this will provide time for much needed economic reforms to boost competitiveness of the manufacturing and services sectors, which will now take centre stage on the reform agenda. South America's agro-industry has competitive advantages and will be a winner of greater EU market access.
While the Brazilian Real is not fully convertible, the country has no major restrictions on current and capital-account flows or on foreign exchange transactions. The solid international reserves position (about US$380bn, 19% of GDP), combined with a favourable balance of payments (the capital account fully finances the current-account deficit) shields Brazil from potential currency pressures. Policymakers have signalled they want to make the Real a convertible currency and turn it into a regional reference currency. We expect some steps in this direction once the government regains market confidence through pension and tax reforms.

While we expect there to be some improvements in terms of simplifying the tax system, there is also uncertainty about other tax changes, so the score does not improve in the forecast period. The fiscal consolidation approach of the newly elected government follows a liberal orientation, with a greater emphasis on spending cuts (through structural reforms, such as the pension reform), rather than on tax increases. The tax burden will remain high for an emerging market, however (32.3%, according to the federal revenue service, on a par with OECD countries like the UK and Canada). Brazil has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world, ranked 184th of 190 countries in the World Bank's annual Doing Business survey for 2019. According to the survey, it takes the average Brazilian company almost 2,000 hours a year of administrative effort to file its tax returns, against a world average of 253 hours/year. In addition, the high degree of indirect taxation reduces the country's global competitiveness, as it increases the costs of production and consumption. Besides, the huge array of sectoral benefits and tax exemptions is a big cause of inefficiencies and competition asymmetries within local markets. The government hopes to address some of these issues.
Tax simplification is on the cards
A bill is advancing in Congress that unifies three federal taxes (PIS, Cofins and IPI), one state tax (ICMS) and one municipal tax (ISS) into a single VAT-style tax to be called the Imposto sobre Bens e Serviços (IBS). Because of the complexities of the ICMS tax, and how it has become used to offer tax incentives as part of a "fiscal war" between states, there is an elevated risk that the ICMS (and ISS) taxes could be dropped from the final bill after pushback from state governors.
The tax simplification may have its core text amended during the legislative approval process, with the inclusion of other tax-reform measures proposed by the government, such as the reduction of corporate income tax rates (perhaps including, at least partially, reductions on payroll contributions), taxation on distributed profits and dividends and ending the deductibility of interest on equity. Other suggested measures, such as raising the individual income tax threshold (to up to five minimum wages) and taxing all types of financial transactions are less likely to go ahead.

The already strong and liquid financial system will benefit from measures to improve efficiency, competitiveness and to reduce the cost of credit. While the Selic policy interest rate is at historically low levels (under 3% in real terms), Brazil still ranks as one of the countries with the highest real rates in the world. The decline in the Selic and of banking spreads over the last three years has reduced the overall cost of credit for consumers and companies. Its level (around 20%) is still high, but should ease. The government is dialling down the availability of subsidised and abundant lending from state banks, especially from the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES, the national development bank). Still, state banks will continue to exercise an important role as sectoral lenders, such as in infrastructure (BNDES), agriculture (Banco do Brasil) and housing (Caixa).
Lower interest rate and inflation environment will boost credit
The "BC+ Agenda", fostered by the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank), has been active since 2016 in promoting modern regulations to strengthen the financial system and reduce the cost of credit. This agenda is expected to advance further and should help to boost credit. The new market-based Taxa de Longo Prazo (TLP, the benchmark long-term financing rate), created in 2018 under this agenda, reduces the monopoly power of the BNDES and improves the effectiveness of monetary policy, since the new rate is more sensitive to the Selic rate (the TLP rate will converge with those of Notas do Tesouro Nacional-B series government bond, whose rates are based on a premium above inflation). The BC+ Agenda is also promoting the regulation of credit fintechs and facilitating the participation of foreign capital in this new market.
Broad and outright privatisation of public banks is unlikely, but the sale of some subsidiaries, the opening of capital to specific segments and measures to enhance capital markets are on the agenda. The BNDES is going through a change of orientation, diverting lending from big to mid-sized companies and primarily to infrastructure projects, combining both public and private funding. The new, more limited focus comes as BNDES returns over US$100bn in debt-creating government transfers extended following the global financial crisis.

The score improves as we expect the government will continue to introduce measures to make the labour market more flexible, consolidating the landmark labour reforms enacted in 2017. The transfer of the Ministry of Labour to the structure of the Ministry of Economy suggests that the government views the pension and labour reforms as complementary actions to reduce labour costs. Mr Guedes' idea of launching a "Carteira de Trabalho Verde Amarela" (Green and Yellow Labour Register), a more flexible labour contractual arrangement, depends on the approval of a new capitalisation pension scheme as a follow up to pension reform, which currently looks unlikely. While wages are relatively low in Brazil (the average monthly income is under US$600), the overall cost of labour for employers is still high, with social security obligations and labour benefits adding an extra cost of close to one-third of salaries.
The new labour legislation was expected to spur job creation as it made the labour market more flexible and dynamic. But the persistently high unemployment rate (over 12%) suggests that this is not yet happening. Still, there was a 34% decrease in the number of labour lawsuits entering courts in 2018, which reduces the high and unpredictable legal costs to firms. Under the new rule, employees who sue an employer and lose the case must pay attorney fees.
Measures to reduce the cost of labour in the short-to-medium term may well be implemented. First, the government seems inclined to alleviate the burden of formal labour by exempting or reducing payroll contributions. Second, the rules defining the monetary value of the minimum wage may change after wage rises in the past got well ahead of productivity gains. Up until 2019, the minimum wage increased every year according to past inflation (as defined in the constitution) plus the real GDP growth rate of two years earlier. The 2011 law formalising this framework expires this year. For 2020, the government has decided that the new minimum wage will be adjusted according to past inflation only, suggesting that this might be the future policy thereafter.
Actions to improve workers' productivity in the long run may be temporarily hurt or delayed given difficulties in the management of education policies. Under the new administration, the Ministry of Education has suffered from political turmoil, which led to the replacement of its former minister (Ricardo Vélez) and to protests across the country on May 15th criticising the spending cuts announced by the new minister, Abraham Weintraub. The ministry is a battleground for the ideological wing of the Bolsonaro government.

Brazil's already fragile infrastructure is currently suffering from a lack of public investment, which reached an all-time low of 1.85% of GDP in 2017 and is estimated to have fallen even further since. This reflects a combination of economic recession, fiscal deterioration and corruption scandals. While tax revenues plummeted during the economic crisis, government spending kept increasing, especially due to a rigid budget structure, where most spending items are mandatory current expenditures. In order to meet their fiscal targets, governments had little choice but to cut their investments. Pension reform will not provide much relief in the forecast period, as the savings will build over the longer term (to 1% of GDP annually later in the 2020s). Moreover, the corruption scandal set off by the Operação Lava Jato since 2014 (Car Wash Operation) has been a major negative shock to the investment projects of Petrobras and large construction companies involved, such as Odebrecht, OAS and Camargo Corrêa, which particularly affected the oil and gas sector. Finally, the deleveraging of the BNDES has resulted in more selective lending by the national development bank, which is traditionally a big funder of infrastructure projects in the energy and logistics sectors. The resumption of investment will hinge on the extent of macro and microeconomic reforms and improvements in the legal and regulatory framework for infrastructure concessions.
Infrastructure concessions envisaged under the Investment Partnerships Program (PPI)-the main state programme for concessions and public-private partnerships (PPPs)-should be one of the most promising initiatives of this government's microeconomic agenda. A legacy of the Temer administration (2016-18), the PPI introduces a series of business-friendly innovations in the governance models and legal frameworks of infrastructure projects. Collectively, auctions in the electricity (2017), oil and gas (2018), and airport sectors (2017, 2019) have raised about US$6bn in initial bids so far, with follow-up investments far exceeding this. The success of the latest auction of a batch of regional airports in March-the first under the Bolsonaro government-reaffirmed foreign investors' appetite for Brazilian assets and the government's commitment to promoting private-sector participation in infrastructure, including measures to facilitate the entry of foreign capital.
Over the last three years, the PPI board has approved 193 projects with expected investments of R365bn (US$94bn). Of those, 147 were completed (auctioned or renewed), with committed investments of about US$67bn, notably on oil and gas (US$45.5bn), energy (US$15.5bn) and airports (US$2.6bn). The remaining backlog of projects points to an estimate of US$27.2bn in investments, mainly in railways (US$15.2bn), roads (US$14.8bn) and ports (US$1.5bn).

The federal government views information and communication technology (ICT) as a strategic area. In 2018, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication (MCTIC), together with BNDES, drafted directives for a National Plan for the Internet of Things (IoT), containing the implementation of 76 actions in areas such as innovation support, international outreach, infrastructure for connectivity and data privacy regulations. Brazil already ranks as the country in the world with the 7th-highest level of investments in ICT and the highest in Latin America, with total investments of US$144bn in 2018, followed by Mexico (US$74bn) and Argentina (US$27bn). The sector employs 1.5m people and is expected to account for almost 11% of the country's GDP by 2020. Universities have an important role in producing innovation. Linkages with the industry are weak, but will continue to grow. According to the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), of the 20 organisations with the highest rates of patents registered in Brazil, 18 are public universities (mostly federal), having filed 674 patent requests in 2017. But this rate is low compared to the total of 5,480 resident patent applications filed that year, according to data from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). While Brazil is the 8th-largest economy in the world, it ranks 19th (out of more than 120 countries) on the number of Intellectual Property (IP) filing requests, according to the WIPO. This ranking includes patents, trademarks and industrial design filing requests.
Nearly 60% of mobile subscriptions use 4G technology. The National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) will hold auctions of 5G frequency in March 2020; the network should begin to be built from 2021. The launch of 5G technology is the first major step towards the Internet of Things (IoT), providing a broad and direct connection of devices, computers and machines.
Brazilians are heavy internet users: the country ranks as third globally in terms of the number of hours per day spent on the internet, behind only Thailand and the Philippines, according to a 2017 survey by GlobalWebIndex, a market research company. Most of this internet usage is related to social media, but an important part is drifting to online shopping: according to data by eMarketer, by the end of 2019, 47.2% of the Latin American e-commerce revenue will be generated in Brazil, followed at a distance by Argentina (12.2%) and Mexico (9.9%).
Fixed broadband internet service is available to 45% of Brazilian citizens. The quality of communication services is reasonable and has been improving along with the expansion of demand. Among the five most populous countries in the world (China, India, the US, Indonesia and Brazil), the country has the third-fastest internet speed (mobile and fixed), behind China and the US.
The digital revolution in Brazil has fostered a continuous and promising increase in the number of start-ups, especially in banking and finance, education, transportation and logistics and food delivery. In 2018, six Brazilian start-ups became local "unicorns", each worth more than R1bn (US$260bn).
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Political alignments between the executive and centrist parties holding a majority in Congress bode well for imperative economic reforms, and on this basis The Economist Intelligence Unit expects progress in many areas, including but not limited to pension reform, tax reform and the privatisation and infrastructure concessions agenda. However, the window of opportunity will close as the October 2020 municipal elections approach and this creates some risks to our forecast, as do ideological differences within the administration and political tensions between the executive and Congress. The economic minister, Paulo Guedes, espouses free-market policies but Mr Bolsonaro's own interventionist tendencies-and those of the handful of retired military officers who are active in his government-may cause some tension and inconsistencies in programme delivery. We assume that Mr Bolsonaro will continue to push for-and succeed in passing-pension reform, as well as other adjustments required to ensure that public spending caps enacted in 2016-designed to stabilise a high (and rising) public debt/GDP ratio-are not exceeded, otherwise debt sustainability stresses and higher inflation would return.
The original pension reform proposal submitted to Congress in February envisaged fiscal savings of R1.2bn (US$310bn) over the next decade, mainly by gradually raising the minimum retirement age (to 65 for men and 62 for women). But its fiscal impact has already been watered down by the rapporteur in the lower house. We assume that pension reform will be approved by October (two rounds of votes in each chamber of Congress with a three-fifths majority each time are required, as consti-tutional amendments would be needed) in a diluted form-to around R800bn, representing fiscal savings of 1% of GDP annually in the long term, bolstering confidence in the public finances.
Reducing bureaucracy and lowering the custo Brasil (the additional cost of doing business in Brazil compared with other emerging markets, stemming from the high regulatory and tax burden) is one of Mr Guedes's objectives. However, these decades-old problems will be a struggle to fix amid push-back from vested interests. We currently expect piecemeal progress, given the fragmentation of Congress and the narrow window of opportunity for reform (typically the first 12-18 months in office). Moreover, we remain unconvinced that Mr Bolsonaro will be fully committed to Mr Guedes's proposals if these face strong resistance in Congress or from other stakeholders. But there is some upside risk to our economic growth forecasts if the government makes greater progress than expected on a long list of outstanding microeconomic reforms. These include:
Tax reforms. Our forecasts assume that some simplification of the tax system (revenue-neutral) will be approved and will offer a tangible productivity boost, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that cannot afford to hire legions of staff to comply with the complicated tax regulations. Mr Guedes wants to unify three sales taxes into a value-added tax (Imposto sobre Bens e Serviços, IBS). He is expected to announce his plans shortly, which may also include proposals to cut corporate taxes. Congress is advancing its own tax simplification bill, which adds a state (Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços, ICMS) and municipal (Imposto Sobre Serviços, ISS) tax too. But given probable pushback from stakeholders-governors and mayors, who would lose control over these important sources of revenue-the ICMS and ISS are less likely to be included in an eventual deal.
Privatisation and infrastructure concessions. Concessions in airports, roads, railways and ports will attract greater private investment than in the past owing to better terms and conditions, and we assume greater privatisation revenue in our forecasts than under previous administrations. Mr Guedes is proposing a sweeping privatisation programme, which aligns with Mr Bolsonaro's rhetoric of removing political appointees (which, in many cases, has led to mismanagement and corruption). A slew of state enterprises are operating at both the federal and the state levels, so there are many potential targets for privatisation. But Brazil's "crown jewels" will be mostly off the table, including Banco do Brasil and Caixa (two large retail banks) and Petrobras (some of its refineries will be divested, however). A priority will be the privatisation of Eletrobras (the state-owned electricity company) in 2020. Some companies on Mr Guedes's list may instead remain in state hands owing to pushback from stakeholders, but governance will be restructured.
Trade liberalisation. This is high on Mr Guedes's agenda and would oblige Brazil's cosseted industries to become more competitive. The objective would also be to integrate manufacturing more closely into global value chains.
"Rightsizing" the public sector. Reforms here would help to free up resources for public works, which have fallen below 1% of GDP. Mr Bolsonaro favours a slimmer state, but will be up against powerful civil servants' unions.

Total public sector debt 77.2 81.8 82.2 80.5 80.2 80.1
We expect the primary balance to move into surplus in the forecast period, assuming that fiscal adjustments materialise and economic recovery boosts revenue. Mr Guedes initially said that he wanted to reduce the primary deficit to zero in 2019 through exceptional revenue from privatisation proceeds and an auction of Petrobras's excess reserves from a "transfer of rights", dating back to its 2010 capitalisation. However, this is unlikely and would only be a temporary solution, and other adjustments will be required over the medium term. Lower interest rates than in the past will ease debt-interest payments in 2019-20, but these will remain sizeable (and will rise slightly in 2021-23 as the policy rate returns to more neutral levels). Overall (including debt interest payments), we forecast that the public-sector deficit will fall from 8% of GDP in 2017 to 5.6% of GDP by 2023. Assuming that pension reform and moderate GDP growth materialise as forecast, the rise in the public debt/GDP ratio (from 77% in 2018) will slow, remaining below 85%. This forecast assumes some debt reduction from privatisation proceeds.

Fiscal consolidation and the likelihood that the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) will gain formal independence will help to strengthen the inflation-targeting framework. The central inflation target has been set to fall by 25 basis points annually from 4.25% in 2019 to 3.5% 2022. Amid a weak economy, spare capacity and well-anchored inflation expectations, we now expect the central bank to cut rates by a total of 50 basis points starting in September to 6% and remain on hold in 2020. We expect a mild tightening cycle to begin in mid-2021. Real policy interest rates are likely to converge to a neutral rate of around 3% thereafter (lower than in the past-based on the assumption of fiscal consolidation). An unexpected failure to pass the pension reform would produce a more hawkish stance in response to a souring of investor sentiment that would trigger capital outflows, currency pressures and higher inflation.

Our forecasts currently assume pension reform approval and tax simplification, as well as piecemeal progress on other items on the microeconomic reform agenda. On this basis, we continue to expect Brazil's economy to pick up from the deep recession of 2015-16 and weak recovery in 2017-19-we forecast annual average growth of 2.3% of GDP in 2020-23. In the short term, investors will remain cautious until there is greater clarity regarding pension reform approval. After falling by 0.2% in January-March, GDP is estimated to have grown by only 0.2% in April-June, and although we expect some greater sequential gains in the rest of the year, we now expect GDP growth of only 0.8% for 2019. The upturn will be driven by an increase in investment and private consumption as the jobs market gradually improves and credit rises. Brazil's upturn will be capped by a US slowdown in 2020, before resuming thereafter.
On the supply side, most components of the services sector are unlikely to recover much dynamism, as they are impaired by low productivity and skills shortages. However, retail, financial services, telecom-munications and trade will benefit to the greatest degree from a forecast recovery in private consumption. Manufacturing suffered much more than services during Brazil's recession, and so its performance during the recovery phase will be weaker than suggested by the average growth rate of 2.3% that we are projecting for 2020-23; activity will continue to be held back by competitiveness and business environment problems.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Agriculture has an importance beyond its small share of GDP (under 6%), owing to its significance as an employer in rural areas and the importance of agribusiness industries for the domestic market and exports. Favourable weather led to record grains harvests in 2016/17 and 2017/18 of around 230m tonnes. The sector will remain vulnerable to adverse weather (particularly the cyclical El Niño weather phenomenon) but will be supported by technological improvements and more intensive land use, as well as by good fundamentals for soft-commodity exports, owing to rising demand in the developing world.
Competitiveness shortcomings persist despite reform efforts
Fiscal constraints will impede credit extension. Competitiveness shortcomings (including a high tax burden, poor infrastructure and high labour costs) will continue to hinder manufacturing (a sector worth 13% of GDP). Light manufacturing industries in particular have lost market share, owing to a surge in Chinese imports in recent years. Capital goods industries will face similar problems, but will be buoyed by domestic demand. Higher investment will enable some labour-intensive manufacturing activities to move up the value chain, but many will struggle to cope with rising import competition. Brazil's manufacturing sector has been mostly inwards-looking and, with a few exceptions, companies have failed to enter linkages with global production systems. Extractive industries are expected to perform reasonably well in the medium term. Although a slowdown in China has softened prices for Brazil's export commodities, demand growth will continue to support mining activity, notably of iron ore. Investment in other mining activities will be boosted following reforms to the mining law in 2018 (lifting royalties for the government and improving the regulatory framework).
Oil and gas provide opportunities
Brazil has the potential to be a major oil player, following a series of discoveries since 2006 in the "pre-salt" layer, a large area in ultra-deep waters off the south-eastern coast that could lift reserves to 80bn barrels, which would place Brazil among the world's top ten reserve-holders. However, supply bottlenecks caused by strict local-content laws in place for projects before 2016 and a huge corruption scandal have set back Petrobras's schedule for producing the oil. Pre-salt fields are producing over 1.7m barrels/day (b/d) of oil from nearly 100 wells, over half of total oil output (2.7m b/d). Petrobras now accounts for under 78% of total production as foreign companies increase their share. Royal Dutch Shell (UK/Netherlands) has an 11.6% share, followed by Repsol-Sinopec (Spain-China), with 3%; Petrogral (Portugal), 2.8%; and Equinor (formerly Statoil, Norway), 1.5%, among others. Most crude oil output is offshore in deep water and production is mainly of heavier grades. More than 80% of oil production and about 40% of natural-gas production is concentrated off the shores of Rio de Janeiro. We expect Brazil's total crude oil production to reach 3.5m b/d by 2023.
BG Group (UK) and Galp (Portugal) were among the few foreign companies acquiring pre-salt reserve fields before auctions were halted in 2006 pending a change in legislation. In 2016 Shell acquired BG Group and these assets. At the first pre-salt auction under the revised rules, held in October 2013, a consortium including Petrobras, CNOOC (China) and Total (France) acquired the Libra block with up to 12bn in reserves, and production began in late 2017. Changes to pre-salt legislation in October 2016 by the Temer government paved the way for the second and third auctions of the pre-salt area (covering eight fields) in October 2017. Out of those allocated, six went to a series of international consortia. Shell was the big winner, gaining three blocks in partnership with a number of other companies, including Petrobras, Total and CNOOC. BP (UK) gained two blocks, also in partnerships. The fourth and fifth pre-salt rounds in June and September 2018 attracted some of the largest oil companies in the world, including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Equinor, Galp and Shell, as well as Petrobras. A mega-auction of "excess" pre-salt reserves of 6bn-15bn oil barrels has been set for November 2019. The state awarded the fields to Petrobras as part of a "transfer of rights" contract dating back to 2010. Petrobras began production in the fields in 2013 and discovered that there was more crude than the 5bn barrels initially estimated. Burdened by massive debt, Petrobras lacked the capital to develop the discoveries, and policymakers want to auction the excess volumes and monetise the significant interest in the reserves.
Services sector is unlikely to recover much dynamism
Most components of the services sector, which accounts for almost 70% of GDP, are unlikely to recover much dynamism in the medium term, as they are impaired by low productivity and skills shortages. However, retail, financial services, telecommunications and trade will perform above the sector average. When credit growth recovers, it is expected to be weaker in the medium term (5-1o% in real terms) than during Brazil's credit boom in 2006-12. The retail sector will be supported by household expenditure growth and rising incomes among poorer households, but will also be weaker than in the past.

Higher food and transport prices lifted inflation to 4.7% in May. We expect inflation to ease and to fluctuate close to the gradually declining central inflation target. Inflation expectations are now better anchored than in the past. A mild monetary tightening cycle over the medium term will keep inflation close to the mid-point of the target range, barring periodic food shortages reflecting adverse weather cycles.

Other than associated volatility as the pension reform debate continues (jitters in May weakened the Real to R4.1:US$1, leading to central bank intervention, and it has since strengthened to R3.86:US$1), we expect the Real to fluctuate in line with Brazil's terms of trade and global financing conditions. By end-2023 we expect the Real to be trading close to R4:US$1. We also expect the Real to be 10% weaker in real effective terms in 2019-23 than in 2008-17, when it was clearly overvalued. Failure to approve pension reform would lead to a sell-off where the Real would be weaker than currently forecast over the medium term.

Large trade surpluses will reduce the current-account deficit in the short term, but it is expected to widen as economic recovery lifts imports. Although prices for Brazil's commodities exports will be higher than in 2014-16, the country will not enjoy terms of trade as favourable as those seen during the 2004-11 economic boom.
A recovery in domestic demand and the resulting rise in imports will narrow the trade surplus from 2.9% of GDP in 2018 to 1.8% of GDP by 2023. The primary income deficit will average 2.2% of GDP in 2019-23, reflecting profit remittances and debt payments, and the services deficit will average 2.1%. These trends will widen the current-account deficit to 2.9% of GDP by 2023, up from an estimated 0.8% of GDP in 2018. Foreign direct investment will average 4.8% of GDP in 2019-23, owing to sizeable market opportunities.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Brazil
Stocks and flows
Brazil is one of the largest FDI recipients and preferred investment destinations in Latin America. Globally, Brazil ranks as one of the top 10 recipients of FDI in the world. According to data released by the Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank), in 2018 total FDI inflow reached US$88.3bn (including intercompany transfers and reinvested profits), a 26% increase over 2017. Foreign investments have shown some resilience during difficult economic times: the average FDI inflow of US$79.3bn seen during the post-crisis period (2017-18) was relatively similar to the US$81.4bn average observed during the pre-crisis period (2013-14). Even during the recession (2014-16), average FDI amounted to US$66.8bn (3.3% of the GDP). By the end of 2018, the stock of FDI reached US$762bn (40.8% of GDP).
Origin and distribution
According to UNCTAD, nine out of ten of the largest acquisitions by foreign companies in 2017 in Latin America occurred in Brazil, with seven involving Chinese buyers (the majority in the energy sector). The acquisitions were mostly related to companies in the electric, oil, infrastructure (gas transmission) and agribusiness sectors. Regarding crossborder transactions, the most active investor countries in Brazil are the US, UK, France, Canada and Germany, accounting for 65% of the 329 inbound crossborder transactions in 2018. Other relevant countries investing in Brazil via acquisitions are China, Mexico, Japan, Singapore and Argentina.
Determinants
Brazil's attractiveness to foreign investors has traditionally been determined by a combination of its market size, regional influence, macroeconomic stability, richness of natural resources and diversified industrial base. The country is a major global player in agribusiness, mineral commodities and bioenergy. However, its complex tax system, relatively unstable legal framework and high borrowing costs have limited a more abundant inflow of foreign investments.
Impact
FDI has played an increasingly important role in recent infrastructure concessions and in the latest pre-salt bids. In this sense, FDI is considered a key success factor in the promotion of higher capital productivity and sustained long-term growth. From a balance-of-payments perspective, FDI has fully covered the current-account deficit in recent years, therefore allowing a healthy and balanced exchange between Brazil and the rest of the world. Although it is hard to measure the direct effects of FDI on productivity, it is clear that the presence of international companies operating in Brazil has a positive correlation with an active research and development activity: patents filled by non-residents through the Brazilian offices amounted to 20,200 in 2017, way exceeding the 7,500 patents filed by residents.
Potential
While the recent economic and fiscal crisis has led to a slowdown of foreign investments, positive expectations about the government's ability to advance with the pension reform, the privatisation agenda and the opening of the economy make the country an interesting investment opportunity for the next five years. Besides the pension reform, expected to be approved at the end of this year, there is a mild chance that the current administration approves changes in the tax system, combining five taxes (federal, state and municipal) into one single value-added tax (VAT), which would greatly simplify the country's complex tax system, considered one of the major barriers to investment. Assuming the pension and tax reforms are implemented during the current administration, Brazil could recover the investment grade by 2023.

Brazil is undergoing a rapid demographic transition, marked by a strong reduction in birth rates and an increase in life expectancy. In 2000, there were 52.1m people in the country aged zero to 14 years, corresponding to 30% of the population, according to the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). By 2015, this age group accounted for 45.3m people (22.3% of the population), equivalent to a 7.7 percentage points fall over 15 years. In the same period, the elderly population (over 65 years), grew by 2.8 points from 5.6% in 2000 to 8.4% of the population in 2015. Considering IBGE's projections for 2030, the share of the elderly population will reach 13.5% of the population, an increase of 5.1 percentage points over 2015.
Rapid demographic transition will hit the workforce
The ratio of the working-age population (15-64 years) over total population is currently reaching its peak, as it went from 68.9% in 2012 to 69.7% in 2017 and is expected to fall again to 69.6% in 2022. This will increase the old-age dependency ratio, that is, the degree to which elderly population depends on the working-age population. In 2023 the old-age dependency ratio is forecast to reach 0.15, meaning that there will be 15 old-aged people depending on 100 people at working age (in 2002 this ratio was 0.10, or 10 old-aged depending on 100 working-age people). This means that future workers will suffer a much harder pressure to finance the ever-increasing number of pension beneficiaries. This is unlikely to be resolved by productivity gains in the labour market, since the current levels of education and skills of the workforce are low and are not expected to advance significantly over the next decade.
Solving the pension system imbalance by raising taxes or labour contributions would be costly and counterproductive. Given the already relatively high tax burden in Brazil, additional tax increases would increase production costs, reduce the level of employment and ultimately limit consumption, growth and revenue collection. In sum, Brazil's demographic transition challenges the fiscal and financial sustainability of the country's current "pay-as-you-go" pension system, even after a probable pension reform in 2019.
The ageing of the population impacts not only the social security system but also the health system, as medical and hospital costs increase with ageing. The country has one of the largest public healthcare systems in the world, as the Constitution of 1988 made healthcare universal and decentralised according to the degree of treatment complexity (municipalities are responsible for basic care and states for medium-to-high levels of care). But the system is already overstretched with growing demand, recently boosted by the economic crisis, as many people migrated from private healthcare insurance (mostly through company schemes) to public health services. And the demands will increase, stretching budgets.
Despite the fact that Brazil is still a young democracy (the average age of the population is just under 30), the country spends 13-14% of GDP on pension-related payments and benefits, while the total sum of public spending on health and education does not go much beyond 10% of GDP.
Given the speed of the demographic transition and the pressure it imposes on the pension and health systems, labour productivity would have to rise to levels that are probably unthinkable in the long run. Real GDP is expected to grow by 2.2% a year on average over for the next five years, while total factor productivity (labour and capital) should only increase by 0.6%. Albeit positive, these growth rates are well below the average of 3.5% and 1% growth rates of GDP and TFP seen during the pre-crisis period (2007-14).
While immigration could be a potential driver for promoting labour productivity, there has not been a policy designed to attract skilled labour nor is there likely be one in the near future. Most of the recent immigrants (South Korean, Chinese, Bolivian, Haitian and Venezuelan) have been absorbed by low-skill functions in the retail sector rather than in the industry, where most of the demand for high-skill labour is found.

Brazil ranks as the eighth-largest economy in the world, with a total GDP of nearly US$2trn, similar to that of Canada and Italy and above Australia, Spain and Mexico. But, given its large population (over 210m people, the fifth-largest in the world), GDP per capita is around US$8,800 (at market exchange rates), rising to US$10,507 by 2023, placing Brazil as an upper-middle country, or the 60th to 70th (depending on the metrics used) richest country in the world, close to Mexico, above China, but below Argentina and Chile. When measured by purchasing power parity, per capita income is a bit higher (US$16,435 in 2019, rising to US$18,535 by 2023). The divergence between the GDP per capita measured by markets rates and PPP reflects the fact that, in emerging economies such as Brazil, lower wages make the price of services and non-traded goods relatively cheap compared to richer countries. Since services represent more than 70% of the GDP, per capita income measured by the PPP exchange rate tends to be higher than at the market exchange rate.
The relatively low median monthly personal income (around US$600) results in a low marginal propensity to save and high marginal propensity to spend. According to research by the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities (Anbima), 58% of Brazilians do not have any financial investments. The high share of income diverted to consumption means household consumption represents about 65% of the country's total GDP. The flipside of this equation is that both savings and investments are very low in the country, with gross fixed investments representing only 15% of the GDP. Even among families who save some of their income, most allocate it in very conservative instruments, primarily in savings accounts, with low interest rates, sometimes even below inflation rates (real savings interest are negative). Little knowledge about financial markets is another cause for low levels of savings in Brazil, so most families do not get much extra income from financial returns.
Low levels of savings reduce the amount of financial guarantees and collateral available to households to borrow from banks. This helps to explain why total domestic credit to the private sector by banks represents only about 60% of the GDP in Brazil, a much lower ratio compared to the average of 113.2% of the GDP for upper-middle income countries in 2017, according to the World Bank. All in all, this means most of the consumption is diverted to goods and services that are less dependent on credit, such as non-durable goods (food and beverages, health and beauty) and semi-durable goods (clothing, house goods, electronic equipment). Consumption of durable goods, such as automobiles and housing, which are based on lending, seem to have been too dependent on governmental stimulus in the past.
The boom and bust cycle experienced between 2003-14 illustrates these consumer and credit trends. During the 2003-11 upswing, private credit surged, buoyed by a reform allowing payroll guarantees, and fuelled purchases of automobiles and home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, etc.). Moreover, the government opted to lower taxation on industrial production, further triggering a consumption boom of durable goods. During the 2011-14 bust phase, there was strong growth in public credit, mainly for social housing programmes destined to poorer families (such as the Minha Casa Minha Vida housing programme). The huge expansion of credit supply during these two periods (the total stock of banking credit went from 27.7% to 66% of GDP between 2003 and 2014) led to a rapid increase in consumption, which was accompanied by an intensive increase in employment in construction and services. However, as these stimuli were not accompanied by productivity gains, the aftermath was a serious problem of indebtedness, both private and public. Working through this balance-sheet overhang has contributed to the tepid nature of Brazil's recovery in 2017-19.
The 2014-16 recession was a hangover effect from the previous fiscal and credit boom. Although credit concessions are showing signs of recovery since 2017, the stock of credit is still below the pre-crisis level (59.7% of GDP in 2017 against 66% in 2014). In this sense, consumption of durable goods should recover only at a moderate pace in the short to medium term, especially given the lack of public stimulus (directly through public budget or indirectly through public banks). The industrial sector, especially civil construction (including housing), has been one of the worst affected sectors and should only reach its pre-crisis levels by 2023, lagging behind other sectors, such as services (expected to recover the pre-crisis level only by 2021) and agriculture (already above the pre-crisis level).
The pace of recovery will also be different among regions due to high disparities in income and growth. Brazil comprises 26 states-plus the federal district-divided into five regions. The north and north-east regions, while comprising 36% of the country's population, represent 23.6% of the national income and almost 20% of GDP, specialising in industrial production of durable and semi-durable goods (as with the Tax Free Industrial Zone of Manaus, capital of the Amazonas in the north) and agriculture and mining (north-east). The south-east region alone concentrates 42% of the population, 51% of income and 53% of GDP, with a very diversified industrial, agricultural and services base, especially in the state of São Paulo. The central-west, Brazil's agricultural belt, specialises in livestock, grains (soybean and corn) and cotton, and concentrates 7.7% of the population, 8.5% of income and 10% of GDP. Finally, the South has 14.3% of the population, 17% of income and 17% of GDP, and mostly specialises in agro-industry.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecast anticipates slower average annual GDP growth over the next 31 years (1.9%) than in 1991-2014 (3%). Even this assumes that labour productivity growth will accelerate beyond recent historical levels, which have been poor. This is needed to help to offset worsening demographic factors. If policy improve-ments and structural reforms were to exceed expectations, faster growth rates would be achievable. Assuming that the potential of oil reserves materialises and that these are relatively well managed by the state, Brazil will figure among the world's largest exporters in the 2020s, which, in turn, will support GDP growth prospects.
Initial conditions: Brazil's advantages of vast natural-resource potential and a young labour force are mitigated by a series of structural constraints, including weak political effectiveness, a generally low level of education and skills, income disparities, low savings rates, difficult logistics (mainly due to chronic underinvestment in infrastructure), and a relatively high fiscal burden. Other than in the agricultural sector, productivity growth has been disappointing in recent years, notwithstanding the acquisition of more advanced technology by the manufacturing sector, which took advantage of exchange-rate appreciation between 2005 and 2014 to increase imports of machinery and equipment. Gradual improvements in the quality and availability of primary and secondary education, and efforts to address infrastructure deficiencies, simplify the convoluted tax system and reduce red tape will underpin stronger productivity growth in the long term. Our projections are based on expectations that a commitment to macroeconomic discipline will prevail.
Demographic trends: Brazil's demographic profile will become less supportive of growth prospects further into the long-term period. Despite the fact that a declining birth rate and a relatively static mortality rate will increase the median age of the population, this will remain low when compared with the major economies of the US, Western Europe and Japan. As population growth will begin to outpace working-age growth in the early 2020s, Brazil's "demographic dividend" is close to ending. Policymakers will have the challenge of addressing the fiscal burden of an ageing population.
External conditions: Although structural external vulnerabilities have declined, the Brazilian economy remains exposed to changes in external financial market conditions through its low domestic savings rates, and the volume of external capital inflows is strongly correlated with risk aversion. Although the public sector has been cautious about external borrowing, corporates have borrowed overseas, and can be affected by sudden stops in capital flows. A rising degree of trade openness and continued diversification of export partners will allow the country to continue benefiting from global trade growth. Some insulation from commodity price shocks is provided by Brazil's strong competitive advantage in the production of agricultural products and its large industrial export base. Global trade liberalisation is expected to make little headway, preventing Brazil from realising its full export potential, particularly in the agricultural sector.
Institutions and policy trends: Democracy has consolidated since the return to civilian rule in 1985. But many political institutions are still ineffective; in particular, the political spectrum is fragmented among several relatively weak parties, producing a legislature that is dominated by vested interests. This will improve slightly on the assumption that measures to enhance party loyalty are implemented. Fiscal pressures will mount, as lawmakers will shy away from watering down the benefits and entitlements enshrined in the constitution of 1988. Spending commitments will rise as the population ages. Tax revenue is already high (32% of GDP), so adjusting the public finances to stabilise and reduce Brazil's high public debt/GDP ratio will prove challenging. A heavy debt burden will keep interest payments high, crowding out the private sector. With much public expenditure characterised by poor effectiveness, fiscal policy will not make a major contribution to long-term growth. We anticipate gradual progress on structural reforms over the coming decade, which will help to ease other constraints on GDP growth, including the convoluted tax system, shortcomings in infrastructure and weaknesses in the labour market. These measures will start to improve Brazil's relative attract-iveness for investors only in the next decade. Regulatory issues will be addressed gradually and improvements in the efficiency of the judiciary should materialise over time.
Long-term performance: Brazil will continue to catch up only slowly with the US, with GDP per head (in US dollars at purchasing power parity) increasing from 26% of that in the US in 2017 to 33% in 2050. Macroeconomic stability will continue to reduce the volatility of economic growth, and forecast GDP expansion of 1.9% annually in 2018-50 will be weaker than the average in 1991-2014 (3%). Improvements in infrastructure, trade expansion, a broader presence of multinational business and a reduction in the debt-service burden will mitigate the slowing in growth of the labour force and help to lift labour productivity growth throughout the outlook period. This is dependent on progress in the politically difficult process of institutional reforms. Our outlook is based on the assumption that governments will remain broadly committed to pushing through changes in the long term. Otherwise, productivity growth and the average rate of GDP growth will fall short of our forecast. The country's political system makes it hard to advance structural reforms. Political reforms could alter this, although these appear intractable. The commercial exploitation and relatively prudent management of the proceeds of Brazil's huge reserves of deepwater oil are now factored into our baseline forecasts, and therefore major setbacks would pose a downside risk to our long-term forecasts. Our forecasts now capture the impact of climate change, as a result of which Brazil's GDP is forecast to be 4% smaller in 2050 than without climate change.

Climate change and sustainability
Brazil adopted its first National Plan on Climate Change Adaptation Goals in 2008 and ratified the UN-brokered December 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change in September 2016. Under the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Brazil has committed to greenhouse gas emission (GGE) control targets. A significant carbon polluter in its own right, Brazil's stance on the enlargement of climate commitments matters. Although Brazil now embraces cuts to GGE it remains a staunch defender of a country's prerogative for economic expansion. It does not pay into a UN climate fund, but instead shares its expertise with poorer nations on renewable energy sources and on slowing deforestation-serving as an example to the likes of China, India and Indonesia, whose shares of emissions are growing.
Brazil's own climate change projections raise considerable concerns over the potential impact on agriculture. An official model for the impact of temperature increases on crop areas for the nine most cultivated crops (responsible for 85% of Brazil's agribusiness) shows that only sugarcane planting would expand. Diminished crop areas occur for cotton, rice, coffee, beans, sunflowers, cassava, corn and soya beans, the latter being the worst affected with a projected decline of around 25%.
The government has developed a climatic risk zoning programme, which produces municipal maps that demonstrate the appropriate cultivation area for major crops, as well as the potential future shifts in these areas due to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. The programme indicates to farmers "what to plant, where to plant and when to plant". The National Monetary Council has mandated that only farmers that grow crops deemed appropriate for their area are eligible for rural credit and insurance. Brazilian institutions have been actively investing in genetically enhancing crops to improve tolerance against dry spells and temperatures. For instance, Embrapa Soja and the Agronomy Institute of Parana created varieties of soybean tolerant to dry spells and heat, and Epagri (Santa Catarina) has made advances in more temperature resilient fruits. The Brazilian National Institute for Space Research has developed a state-of-the-art forest fire early warning system using satellite imagery. To mitigate the vulnerability faced by its energy sector due to a heavy reliance on hydroelectricity (around 64% of total installed electricity generation capacity), alternative renewable sources are being promoted.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]the issue is likely to fester in the lead-up to the federal election. [...]the Liberal government plans to impose the same federal carbon tax on the province of Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down in March, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. [...]the Canadian dollar will depreciate slightly this year, on average, against its US counterpart, to C$1.32:US$1.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October election. However, it will be a tight contest and the Liberal government's current parliamentary majority is at risk.
The renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has eased trade uncertainty, but we expect delays in the ratification process of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA; NAFTA's successor), probably until 2020. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its key export market.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.6% in both 2019 and 2020, as private consumption growth moderates and an economic slowdown in the US dampens export demand. Real GDP growth will average 2.3% per year in 2021-23.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 2% in 2019, from 2.2% in 2018, reflecting recent monetary tightening, weaker external demand and generally lower oil prices. Inflationary pressures will ease further in 2020, in line with a subdued economy, before picking up from 2021 as growth regains momentum.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. We expect it to keep rates on hold in 2019, before sanctioning a 25-basis-point cut in 2020, as global economic growth slows further. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. The merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.6% of GDP during 2019-20.

Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.
2021-23: The government completes its update of financial legislation, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
The labour market
2019-20: Canada will enact policies to streamline processes and increase quotas to expedite the hiring of foreign talent by companies.
2021-23: The government further encourages the entry of skilled workers and professionals by raising its immigration target.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Work begins on the Trans Mountain Expansion project, which will pipe additional crude oil from Alberta, although further legal challenges could slow progress.
2021-23: After years of uncertainty, pipelines to carry more energy resources from Alberta begin to come on stream.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The technology sector benefits from workers moving from the US, especially those on that country's H1B visas, for whom the political climate becomes more difficult.
2021-23: Expertise in artificial intelligence takes root, particularly in the academic centres of Toronto and Montreal.

Background: The Canadian economy was the tenth-largest in the world in 2018 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 75% of its goods exports and is the source of 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue; just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French-speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the two leading political parties in the province is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party has led a majority government since 2015; the next general election will be held in October 2019.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. In 2016 the government introduced a new top marginal rate of personal income tax of 33%, which applies to taxable income over C$210,371 (US$157,706) in 2019.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$17bn in 2018 and the current-account deficit was US$45.3bn (2.6% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party government, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, won a majority at the federal election in 2015, ending a decade of Conservative Party rule. The government has made progress on most of its reform agenda. However, controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case has tarnished Mr Trudeau's political brand, and friction with provincial administrations over environmental policy has intensified. The next federal election is due on October 21st and unofficial campaigning is already underway, after parliament went into recess in June. Although the opposition Conservatives remain ahead in opinion surveys, the Liberal Party is regaining ground and the election results will be tight. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberals to remain in government after the election, but its parliamentary majority is at risk, raising the prospect of legislative gridlock.
Mr Trudeau's popularity has been significantly damaged by his mishandling of allegations by the former attorney-general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, that he and his officials put inappropriate political pressure on her to abandon the criminal prosecution for alleged fraud of SNC-Lavalin (a large Quebec-based construction and engineering firm, which denies the charges). Ms Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, resigned from their positions, citing a lack of confidence in the government. They were both expelled from the caucus in April and will run as independents in October. As a result, the issue is likely to fester in the lead-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments has intensified in recent months, owing mainly to disagreements on environmental legislation. Opposition parties have taken control of several provincial governments in recent years, setting the stage for policy battles ahead of the federal election. The most significant change of power has been the return to provincial government in Alberta of the United Conservative Party, which defeated the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) government at the provincial election in April. The new Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, is a vocal critic of the federal Liberal government's environmental policies, which he argues have harmed Alberta's resource-based economy. In May he repealed the carbon tax in the province introduced by the former NDP government. As a result, the Liberal government plans to impose the same federal carbon tax on the province of Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. The imposition of the carbon tax in these provinces, and the nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project, has raised questions over federal jurisdiction. The Trans Mountain expansion, designed to carry additional crude oil from Alberta to a port in British Columbia (BC), is opposed by the NDP provincial government in BC and by environmentalists, and the federal cabinet's decision on June 18th to proceed with the project is controversial.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Political fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair saw the opposition Conservative Party overtake the Liberals in opinion surveys in February 2019, although support for the Liberals has begun to recover in recent weeks. According to an average of recent polls published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on July 10th, the Conservatives were supported by 34.3% of respondents, compared with 31.4% for the Liberals. The NDP was well behind, in third place, backed by 13.7% of those surveyed. Mr Trudeau's overall approval rating remains slightly below that of the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer.
We nevertheless expect the Liberal Party to be in a position to form a minority government after the federal election, due on October 21st 2019, reflecting the advantages of incumbency, and the implementation of much of the government's agenda, including the legalisation of cannabis.
However, the contest will be tight. Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and have built momentum under Mr Scheer. They will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes, government spending, the cost of its climate change policies, and its broken pledge to change the electoral system from first-past-the-post to proportional representation. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing over 40,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Under the Liberals, Canadian foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. This is in clear contrast to the policies pursued by Donald Trump's administration in the US. As a result, bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration. Canada will, nonetheless, seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far. Where possible, Canada will attempt to circumvent the White House by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The signing in November 2018 of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA and preserve the trilateral arrangement, mitigates significant trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier deal. In particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which Canada relies on to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. It also grants the US greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). Canada also negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports. The lifting in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports has removed a key obstacle to ratification of the USMCA. However, the timing for ratification of the agreement poses a challenge for all three administrations. Ongoing delays on the US-Mexico side, and Canada's parliamentary recess until November 2019 will complicate the ratification process. Our central forecast is that the USMCA will be ratified by all three nations, but this process could extend into next year. Downside risks to ratification will grow as time passes, owing to the start of the presidential election season in the US.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to key Asian markets over the forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines. With full implementation, the figure is set to rise to 99%.
China was a key target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities on fraud charges (that she denies). Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. In March the Canadian government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition. In response, China has detained two Canadians on charges of spying, sentenced two others convicted of drug crimes to death and used non-tariff barriers to impede imports from Canada, including canola (rapeseed), bull semen and meat. Bilateral relations will remain tense for as long as Ms Meng faces the threat of extradition to the US.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government will seek to support domestic industries that are adversely affected by US trade protectionism and Canada's trade issues with China. Measures to boost the competitiveness of Canadian businesses following tax cuts in the US last year included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. However, the government will struggle to balance environmental policy with support for the fossil fuel industry. It has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20/tonne (US$15/tonne) in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. This tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. But it has also approved the controversial C$7.4bn (US$5.5bn) expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which it now owns. The project still faces some regulatory hurdles, and construction work, which is scheduled to begin this year, could be delayed further by legal challenges.
Policymakers will continue to keep a close eye on the residential property market, which remains a key risk owing to monetary policy tightening last year and overleveraged Canadian households. Measures introduced by the federal government and provincial governments in Ontario and BC have helped to cool the housing market. In Vancouver and Toronto, foreign buyers are now subject to a 15% tax on property purchases, while the federal government has tightened mortgage requirements nationwide, which has improved the quality of new mortgage lending. National house prices have softened modestly since December, although trends vary across the country. We expect the housing market to remain sluggish in 2019, reflecting a combination of tighter lending standards, continued affordability pressures, and diminished investor activity, although a major correction is unlikely in the absence of higher interest rates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure and other spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but this will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the introduction of the carbon tax and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018 will weigh on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit, as increased government support will be expected to shore up the economy and government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down in March, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. Official projections show the budget deficit declining to C$9.8bn, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, by 2023/24. We project that the fiscal deficit will expand from 0.4% of GDP in 2018 (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based) to 0.9% of GDP in 2019 and 1% of GDP in 2020. The government will look to narrow the deficit in the longer term, and we expect it to fall gradually, to 0.7% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points between July 2017 and October 2018, in response to rising inflation, and to discourage highly indebted households from accumulating further debt. The BoC has since kept rates steady, reflecting a sharp drop in inflation in early 2019, and weak real GDP growth in the first quarter. The year-on-year inflation rate has since picked up to around the BoC's 2% inflation target, while the economy appears to have perked up in the second quarter. However, the BoC has cautioned that the economic outlook remains clouded by global trade tensions, which will continue to weigh on export growth and investment.
We forecast that the Federal Reserve (the Fed, the US central bank) will cut its policy rate in December 2019, with two more rate cuts to follow in 2020. We continue to expect that the BoC will keep its policy rate unchanged this year, as it views the current level of 1.75% as stimulatory. However, we now expect it to sanction a 25-basis-point cut in 2020, as US growth slows further; because of the close ties between the two countries, this will weigh on economic growth in Canada. The BoC will begin gradually to tighten monetary policy again from 2021.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to 1.9% in 2018, from 3% in 2017, and we expect the pace of economic expansion to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. Previous monetary tightening, high household debt levels and the subdued housing market will weigh on private consumption growth this year. However, solid growth in government spending will help cushion the impact. Export growth is also expected to moderate as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's key export market.
Much of 2018 was characterised by the escalating trade dispute with the US. The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the key downside risks to our forecast, although the timeline for the ratification of the successor agreement, the USMCA, could be extended into 2020. Canadian producers and manufacturers will benefit from the removal in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports, and the end of the retaliatory import tariffs that Canada imposed, but are feeling the pinch from trade restrictions imposed by China on some Canadian farm exports, such as canola. Global trade uncertainty remains a major downside risk to out forecast. Other risks to the economic outlook include a sharp drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
Growth in the US and world trade will continue to lose steam in 2020, when we expect real GDP growth in Canada to remain well below its long-term trend, at 1.6%. The pace of economic expansion is expected to pick up again in 2021, and real GDP growth will average 2.4% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued public investment in infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices throughout much of 2018 and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures last year, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation accelerated to an average of 2.2%. The inflation rate fell back to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, below the BoC's 2% target rate, owing to lower petrol prices and the impact of previous monetary tightening by the central bank. However, it has picked up more quickly than we expected, to 2.3% year on year in May. In view of this, we have pushed up our forecast for consumer price inflation in 2019, which we now expect will average 2% (previously 1.8%). Subdued economic growth and generally lower oil prices will lead to a further easing in the inflation rate next year, before it picks up again from 2021 as the economy strengthens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Falling oil prices and slowing growth weighed on the currency late last year and in early 2019. As a result, the Canadian dollar will depreciate slightly this year, on average, against its US counterpart, to C$1.32:US$1. Downward pressure on the Canadian dollar next year from continued weak economic growth, soft oil prices and modest monetary easing by the BoC will be mitigated by deeper interest-rate cuts from the Fed, keeping the local currency broadly unchanged at an average of C$1.33:US$1 in 2020. A pick-up in growth from 2021, and the resumption of monetary tightening, will underpin a modest appreciation in the Canadian dollar in the latter part of the forecast period, with the currency forecast to average C$1.30:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. The merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will therefore remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.6% of GDP during 2019-20. The CPTPP, the effects of which will first be felt at the start of the next decade, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. We expect that this will help to narrow the current-account deficit to 2.1% of GDP by 2023.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly. [...]that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty offers credible. [...]violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the line in the sand that provokes some sort of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. [...]power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable, and we currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures, and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we assume that there will be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and Europe of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry.
The pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands for some politically difficult reforms from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2019-23, up from 80th in the historical period. Assuming regime change, improvements are expected, but it will take time for reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment to bear fruit.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Large-scale emigration of skilled labour complicates hiring.
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid means that rationing and unpredictable blackouts continue. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$18bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply let to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the current-account surplus at 2% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable, and we currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures, and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we assume that there will be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
Our forecast for regime change is based on the extent of the economic and humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Venezuela. This has deeply damaged support for Mr Maduro among the population at large; we believe that it will ultimately erode support for Mr Maduro among key supporters in the military who currently prop him up in power. It is less clear, however, what the exact trigger for regime change will be. There are three main paths to a political transition: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the risk of military action, by the US or Colombia, is very low; although negotiations have been ongoing in recent weeks, we believe trust issues on both sides will be insurmountable and do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis.
On this basis, we believe the most likely scenario for regime change is some sort of internal coup. With US sanctions adding to the problem of dollar scarcity, Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee the regime's raison d'etre-the enrichment of its members-and we expect pragmatists within government and within the military to turn on him and pave the way for some sort of political transition. A failed uprising on April 30th demonstrated the difficulty of this sort of effort, and has incurred a heavy political cost, as the regime has become ever more vigilant of discontent among its ranks. However, the April uprising, which apparently included the participation of top-ranking government officials alongside Mr Guaidó, confirmed the existence of cracks within the regime's ranks at the highest levels. On this basis, our forecast for regime change still stands.
This forecast is underpinned by three key assumptions. Firstly, that regime pragmatists will prevail over hardliners. Despite the ongoing collapse of the patronage system, there are risks to this assumption, considering frequent purges within the military and the presence of dozens of important military figures, leading to co-ordination problems. Secondly, that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a government transition is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this forecast come in the form of greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities that could be providing the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
We recognise the very high risks to our baseline view, and believe there are two main alternate scenarios. The first, and more likely, alternate scenario is the maintenance of the status quo, with a protest-fatigued population, the regime hunkering down, the opposition deflating, and the country becoming increasingly isolated and impoverished. The second scenario is one of prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict among regime factions. That said, we expect neither of these scenarios to be tenable in the medium to long term: with no prospect of real reform, we believe that a chronically weak economy will ultimately make Mr Maduro's position untenable. Moreover, violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the line in the sand that provokes some sort of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. For these reasons, we continue for now to believe that regime change in the forecast period remains likely, even if it does not occur in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. Although this timeline is extremely ambitious given the scale of the task, we tentatively expect national elections to take place by the end of 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming. The task will be huge, as deep reforms to the electoral authority, to the electoral registry and to the voting system will be required, and rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised his presidency. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative lacks international legitimacy. However, if tension ratchets up and domestic violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and the state oil company, PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in terms of investment, and we believe that Russia and especially China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt to protect their current investments in Venezuela. Indeed the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, recently expressed his willingness to potentially work with Mr Guaidó, with the condition that he is legitimately chosen via a presidential election.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy to rein in hyperinflation and to abandon foreign-exchange controls (with few foreign reserves left to protect). However, we believe such efforts are doomed to failure without comprehensive microeconomic reform and improvements in rule of law and policy predictability that will not be forthcoming under the present regime.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and Europe of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands for some politically difficult reforms from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$46bn in 2020-23) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect that the non-financial public-sector deficit this year will be well into double digit levels as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Under our expectation of substantial currency adjustment, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise dramatically in coming years; however, our forecasts assume that a combination of debt restructuring and deep fiscal adjustment gradually bring the debt ratios under control. The process will be complicated, however, by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds and all but one of PDVSA's bonds are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. However, other investors have taken claims to the courts, and the results of these court battles will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining company, Crystallex, is seeking to collect an arbitration award by seizing shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. A ruling on the treatment of PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the government is pending, and will have implications for future debt restructuring. The US government now considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but nonetheless, the risk of seizure of Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments, will remain high in the short term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year has had a temporary stabilising effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise somewhat over rcent weeks. On the basis that this measure is insufficient to tackle underlying inflation pressures, we expect monthly inflation to rise again in the short term. But based on our assumption that a transition government that places a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation will soon come to power, we do not currently project a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced during 2018 (though there are substantial political risks to this forecast). Instead, under a new government, we expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of an emergency macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency, a temporary peg or outright currency substitution in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 18.5% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. Our forecast for an economic recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 60% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.
Our forecast for a recovery in investment from 2020 assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment. We expect oil output to bottom out at 700,000 barrels/day (b/d) over the coming quarters, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2019-23) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will start to recover in 2020 on the back of the oil sector recovery, but an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb some of the projected increase in oil output. At the same time, import demand will rise sharply in 2020. All this will constrain the rebound of GDP initially, but in 2022-23, we do expect real GDP growth to gather some pace.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, dollar constraints on import capacity, and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant gap between these data and other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. These data have shown some disinflation in recent months, with monthly inflation falling below the hyperinflation "threshold" of 50% per month. Huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand persist, however, and we expect inflation to remain extremely high for as long as the Maduro regime remains in power. On the basis of our assumption of regime change in the short term, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast of a political transition later in 2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) to try to tackle the inflation problem is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such moves is hard to predict. Our forecasts currently assume extremely large currency adjustments that restore some competitiveness to the local currency in real terms over time. For now, and with few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime has announced a loosening of currency controls. However, access to dollars via formal means will remain extremely difficult, and we believe that the foreign-exchange system will remain highly controlled in practice. In this environment a strong black-market exchange rate premium is likely to re-emerge. By end-June the premium was widening but was still small by historical comparison, with the official rate at around BsS6,725:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of over BsS7,900:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We have revised our current-account data in line with the recent publication of official data for 2017-18 by the BCV, which show that Venezuela continued to post current-account surpluses in the period on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. However, we continue to project a shift into current-account deficit this year, bearing in mind the collapse of export earnings stemming from US sanctions on the oil trade. This deficit will emerge despite the non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). We have also excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data, on which our debt forecasts are based. Later in the forecast period we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, but we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been severely reduced. These factors will keep the current account in deficit, although we expect the latter to narrow to a manageable level of around 3% of GDP towards the end of the forecast period.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. It hinges on substantial IMF finance, rapid macroeconomic stabilisation, the fast resolution of a debt-renegotiation process, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufacturing goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016), and the official rate will be kept fairly stable.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Oil prices and exports will fall in 2019-20 but so will imports. Both imports and exports will then expand in 2021-23 but a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score will improve slightly but its global and regional rankings will worsen as the administration struggles with the reform process and other countries make more significant improvements.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but capital controls will not be necessary barring another (not expected) oil price crash.
2021-23: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will markedly increase the fiscal cost of the civil service.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically following the completion of the 2019 elections, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won a presidential election in February 2019 and will remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. For any Nigerian leader, managing the country's myriad security threats would be an insoluble challenge, but under Mr Buhari there are particular reasons to expect serious unrest.
The foremost challenge to stability is an over-stretched military and police force, which will be unable to manage simultaneous security crises. The government cannot afford to upgrade Nigeria's security capabilities to an adequate level without making sweeping reforms to increase the tax take, and no such overhaul is anticipated.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), is heating up, with insurgents appearing better equipped and staging more audacious attacks than had been the case in recent years. Military setbacks are getting worse and, as this is one of Mr Buhari's voter strongholds, the president will be keen to reassert control over the situation. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east of Nigeria will remain a low-level conflict zone, albeit isolated, and the campaign will divert military resources from pockets of severe instability elsewhere. One such hotspot is just to the south, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, where violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for land have killed several thousand civilians in recent years. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be used to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of constricted food supply and, as a result, consumer prices.
The military and police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping in the north and north-west, where widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook. Finally, militants in the oil-producing south will remain aggrieved by inertia over their key demand for more federal revenue from hydrocarbons to be kept locally for development. Wholesale reform of the oil sector is a massive task and one that The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to be achieved in the forecast 2019-23 period. Our assumption is that attacks by aggrieved militants and saboteurs on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem in Delta State, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The election in February 2019 reaffirmed a deep electoral divide between the APC-supporting north and southern Nigeria, a stronghold of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). In the next general election in 2023, custom dictates that the candidates of both main parties will be southerners, giving the PDP a chance to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the 2019 presidential vote, which cost them victory. Moreover, Nigeria's economic outlook is bleak, with growth barely keeping pace with a rapidly increasing population. Much of the cause of rising poverty and high unemployment will be political in origin; the parliamentary election gave the APC a large majority in both houses, which in theory should be enabling, but Mr Buhari's first term was marked by divisions between the executive and parliament (as had happened to presidents before him), and crucial bills including the national budget were delayed by months. As legislators typically prioritise the interests of their constituents over party and federation in Nigeria, similar tensions could easily reoccur in Mr Buhari's second stint. This will prevent meaningful reform (for example on managing the oil sector), and inactivity on such fronts means that the APC will be the subject of voter frustration. The PDP candidate should be able to capitalise from this, giving them an edge from the start.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian import restrictions) could strain ties. Relations with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second and final term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be pursued. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies, and Mr Buhari will not willingly attempt to dismantle consumer price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system will be off-putting to foreign direct investors or those acquiring illiquid assets, for fear of a return of capital controls (last imposed in 2016). Concerns about this will be especially pronounced whenever global crude prices soften, but the omnipresent risk of convertibility restrictions will ultimately keep foreign direct investment well below Nigeria's potential throughout the forecast period, with inflows expected to be below 1% of GDP in all years.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC become profitable rather than relinquish state control over them entirely. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint-ventures that it has with international oil companies, but demand will be held back by the difficulty of operating in Nigeria and uncertainty about fiscal terms (with deep political divisions about how to distribute hydrocarbons revenue having stalled critical legislation). As a result, investor interest will be short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off key public assets for a low price. As a consequence, the NNPC will continue to domineer the oil sector, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes, and a probable hike to value-added tax (VAT), but any increase in revenue will be from an extremely low base. Instability in many parts of the country will also impede collection. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example, in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day-a level not seen since the oil price slump, and one that will be unobtainable given underinvestment and OPEC production quotas. In all, federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.9% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2022 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with a low capital budget and poor execution. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the roll-out of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, fiscal flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, as a result, revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit averaging 1.9% of GDP over 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20, notwithstanding a small rate cut by the CBN in March (upheld in May). Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise during 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above or around the target. However, real interest rates will be too high to be viable for much of the private sector.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019-20 the economy will be held back by power shortages, insecurity, high inflation and tight credit conditions. A slower global economy will also hold back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for some monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken, although remain well below potential at an annual average of 3.3%. This is still abnormally low for Nigeria, especially as we forecast population growth of 2.6% a year for the 2019-23 forecast period.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will drive higher condensate output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans, as well as power supply gaps. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism (affecting trade), tight credit conditions affecting areas such as real estate and finance, and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will remain elevated at 11.8% in 2019, as a 67% increase in the minimum wage combines with disruptions to local food supply and widening import restrictions. In 2020 inflation will remain well above the CBN's targeted ceiling of 9%, at 10.9%, as demand-side forces from the minimum-wage rise continue. It is also likely that there will be a three percentage-point hike to VAT, with oil prices (and, as a result, fiscal revenue) likely to come under pressure in that year. With the base effects from this fading, core inflation will gradually ease over the rest of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Conflict and supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's agricultural heartland-will prevent a faster slide, together with widening protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad. Currently 43 items are barred from foreign-exchange access, the most recent addition being textiles, and the CBN wants to increase the list to 50 as a means of stimulating non-oil activity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. Overall the set-up is not expected to be tampered with. Although we anticipate a fall in exports over 2019-20, the decrease will not be steep or sustained enough to force a devaluation of the official exchange rate. Over this period flat or declining interest rates in the US (we expect a 50-basis-point drop to be executed by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, in 2020) will also support foreign-exchange supply via portfolio inflows. Higher global crude prices thereafter mean a flat official rate is likely throughout the forecast period. In real terms, currency stability (for both the official and more market-determined rates) means real appreciation of the naira against trading partners as inflation remains high. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue or allowing more market-determined rates to weaken in order to regain international competitiveness. However, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, is set against the idea, and in any case industrial strategy is focused on import-substitution and supplying the domestic market. As a result, devaluation is not included in the core forecast.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The profile of export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. Output gains will keep earnings in growth in 2019, and higher global prices in 2021-23 and continued output gains (with a new mega-refinery coming on stream in around 2021) will do likewise. Only in 2020-when prices fall faster than incremental production gains-will exports drop.
Nigeria's government actively promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural produce). However, this policy is oriented more around stimulating local industry than reducing imports per se, and an overvalued naira will contribute to fairly strong consumer demand. Imports will fall only slightly in 2019-20, however, reflecting lower global crude prices (Nigeria imports almost all its petrol requirement). As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise, imports will then grow faster. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will average 1.6% of GDP in 2019-20, widening to 2.4% of GDP in 2021-23 as oil prices strengthen and the new refinery comes on stream.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars. The EU's creation dates back to the Rome Treaty of 1957, which created the European Economic Community between the six founding EU member states (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). After four enlargements in 1973 (UK, Denmark, Ireland), 1981 (Greece), 1986 (Spain and Portugal) and 1995 (Austria, Finland and Sweden), the EU counted 15 members. The collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU; UK-EU negotiations on the UK's exit from the EU have so far been difficult. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than those of other east European countries. The effects of war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-eastern Europe. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, many countries continue to have deep economic and political ties with Russia.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular, the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-notably those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at EU level. A total of 19 EU members share the euro as their currency and are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have sometimes been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform, and institutional change, vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster-and more successfully-with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with the traditional mainstream parties will persist during the forecast period (2019-23), leading to greater success for far-right, far-left and centrist parties in elections; difficulties in government formation; and the creation of unusual (and in some cases unstable) coalitions.
The European Parliament elections resulted in a more fragmented political landscape. The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) remained the two largest groups in the European Parliament in the 2019 elections, but lost their majority for the first time. The appointment process for a number of top EU jobs becoming available later this year will be tricky, and is likely to take some time.
The UK remains in political deadlock over Brexit. The EU has stated that it will not revise the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, but the British parliament has rejected both this deal and a "no-deal" Brexit. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that a general election is the most likely way out of the current impasse, with a second referendum a subsequent possibility. A no-deal Brexit remains a significant risk.
Economic policy
We expect the euro zone to resist steps towards full fiscal integration, but the Franco-German axis will drive forward some reforms in the coming years.
A number of countries will continue to push back against EU and euro zone rules. Most notably, the dispute between the Italian government and the European Commission over the country's fiscal plans will continue later in 2019, with the imposition of an excessive-deficit procedure (EDP) now looking likely.
We expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain a dovish stance, in view of the pronounced downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook. We expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate in June 2020 and the main refinancing rate in December 2020, with tightening proceeding thereafter at a gradual pace.
Economic growth
The euro zone's economic recovery became broad-based and sustained in 2017, but sentiment indicators declined and growth slowed in 2018. This loss of momentum has carried through into 2019 and we expect a substantial slowdown in growth rates across the bloc this year.
The main reason for the slowdown is a deterioration of the external environment, with softer global trade and high geopolitical uncertainty, reflecting US-China trade tensions, the threat of a US tariff increase on EU automotive exports and the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the UK.
However, domestic demand has remained firm, with private consumption supported by widespread labour market improvements, and investment growth fuelled by high capacity-utilisation rates and favourable lending conditions.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries, as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period (2019-23). The negative political fallout from the global financial crisis and euro zone crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the traditional political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. The fragmentation of the political landscape is leading to delays in forming governments after elections, unstable coalition governments, and a gradual hardening in rhetoric and policy on migration. The rise in populism has also hampered significant reform efforts at both the national and regional levels, and a meaningful overhaul of the European institutional framework is unlikely.
Leading issues for European political stability as we approach the mid-point of 2019 include the ongoing fallout from the Brexit vote in the UK, the nomination process for the top jobs becoming available later this year at the EU institutions and the political impact of hardening attitudes towards migration.
Challenges for the EU today include Brexit, new leaders and migration
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a challenge for the bloc, and the departure of one of the EU's largest members will continue to reverberate after the UK leaves (probably in 2019 or 2020). The country's departure will leave a hole in the EU budget, which will be difficult to overcome without generating antagonism within the bloc. However, so far Brexit has resulted in increased European solidarity rather than tensions between member states. This is because several member states-including France and Germany-are keen to send a strong political message to governments contemplating exiting the EU that a departure from the bloc is inevitably difficult, and must ultimately be inferior to EU membership.
In the wake of the European Parliament elections on May 23rd-26th the EU is hard at work on the appointments to a number of top jobs coming up in the second half of 2019. The presidencies of the European Commission, European Council, European Parliament and European Central Bank (ECB) will all become available, along with a new foreign policy high representative; and the nominations will need to ensure a balance across countries, genders and political preferences. The fact that the European Parliament elections have delivered a more fragmented parliament (compared with the 2014 Parliament elections) means that the process of choosing the next Commission president will be lengthy. The main point for financial markets, however, is that a hawkish new head of the ECB remains unlikely-we expect one of the dovish north European candidates to take this role.
Across the continent populist parties and politicians are putting pressure on mainstream parties to address their concerns, notably on migration and integration policies. The issue of refugee relocation has been a focal point since 2015 for tensions between the EU, which wants to avoid the burden of looking after migrants from falling exclusively on Greece and Italy, where most arrive, and a core of central European countries that do not want to accept these people. Elsewhere, popular concerns about the difficulties of integrating asylum-seekers have led to rising support for far-right parties, and a shift towards the right on the part of many centre-right parties with regards to social issues.
The political scene in Germany will be much less stable than in the recent past
Germany is a leading example of a country where support for the traditionally dominant mainstream parties has declined sharply as the landscape of voter support has become more fragmented. The government installed in Germany in March 2018 is another grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the Christian Social Union (CSU, its Bavarian sister party) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). The election dealt a blow to the two leading parties, which recorded their worst results since the 1950s and brought the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), where it is now the largest opposition party.
Germany has played an important role on the EU stage in recent years, under the chancellorship of Angela Merkel since 2005. However, Ms Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU in December 2018, and her successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is unlikely to play as high profile an international role. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer has a similar policy-positioning and consensus-building approach as Ms Merkel, but seems keen to shift the party slightly further to the right, especially on migration, and has made a series of gaffes since her nomination, suggesting that she will not be as adroit a politician as her predecessor.
At the same time, the SPD is in crisis, with its leader, Andrea Nahles, stepping down after an exceptionally poor performance in the European Parliament elections in May. The upcoming leadership contest is likely to hinge on whether the party should remain in the grand coalition, and this raises the risk of a pre-term federal election (before 2021).
In France political stability has returned, for now
In France Mr Macron enjoys the support of a solid majority of deputies in the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), which has enabled him to make substantial progress on his ambitious legislative agenda since taking office in May 2017. He came to power determined not to give in to the sort of street protests that had derailed the policies of many of his predecessors and front-loaded difficult structural reform efforts in the hope that the results would materialise before the end of his term in 2022.
However, from late 2018 he found himself facing growing criticisms that he was "out of touch" and the "president of the rich", with a demonstration against a proposed fuel-tax rise in November escalating rapidly to a nationwide series of protests and significant violence. Protesters, who are named the "Gilets Jaunes" because of their high-visibility jackets, are angry about stagnant incomes, tax reforms that seem to be squeezing the lower-middle classes and a perceived decline in public services. The government announced EUR10bn in tax concessions in December and held an unprecedented national debate in January-March to allow people to air their grievances. At the end of April Mr Macron announced a raft of new measures to ease the tax burden, lift pensions and boost public service provision.
We expect reform progress to be slower now in France than at the start of Mr Macron's tenure. However, the overall direction of travel is unchanged, and the president's approval ratings have experienced a modest recovery, suggesting that political stability has been recovered in France-at least for now.
Political stability will improve in Spain, but the Catalan issue is still unresolved
In Spain politics has become increasingly unsettled in recent years. Parliamentary fragmentation, a litany of political graft scandals and rising regional nationalism in Catalonia have all posed serious challenges to governance. Against this backdrop, in late April 2019 Spain held its third general election since December 2015. The snap vote was triggered by the rejection at the hands of two Catalan pro-independence parties of the 2019 budget proposal made by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government. The PSOE, led by Mr Sánchez, won a decisive victory at the election, raising its vote share from 22.6% in 2016 to nearly 29%. The nationalist, far-right Vox entered the national parliament for the first time after surging to 10.3% of the vote. Government-formation negotiations will be tricky, but we believe that the most likely outcome is a left-wing minority government led by the PSOE, and supported by the far-left party, Unidas Podemos (UP) and several other parties.
Once the government has been formed, we expect an improvement in political stability relative to 2015-18. Removing a government from office is exceptionally hard in Spain (it requires proposing an alternative). And to pass legislation, the PSOE will be able to count not only on the parties that we expect would support its investiture, but also on the liberal Ciudadanos (Citizens). On the downside, the Catalan issue will persist with no clear solution in sight.
Brexit is likely to be delayed owing to a political deadlock in the UK
The UK is currently in a political deadlock over Brexit. If the UK were to exit the EU without a deal, which remains an active risk, this would be extremely disruptive to the British and EU economies. British members of parliament (MPs) have therefore voted against a "no-deal Brexit", and the speaker of the House of Commons (the lower house of parliament), John Bercow, has made clear that a no-deal Brexit cannot happen without parliamentary approval. At the same time, MPs have repeatedly voted against the agreement reached by Mrs May with the EU in November 2018, and against a variety of other potential post-Brexit configurations. The EU has made clear that renegotiating Mrs May's deal is not an option. Solving this impasse under the current parliament therefore looks unlikely.
After lengthy negotiations at an emergency summit in April, the EU agreed to delay Brexit for "as long as necessary", but to no later than October 31st. After failing to reach a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party on how to move forward, Mrs May stood down as prime minister on June 7th. A Conservative Party leadership contest is taking place, which will determine who takes over as prime minister and the government's next steps. We believe that there is a strong chance of a new general election in order to resolve the deadlock, with no Brexit and no deal still both live options.
The Italian government will be unstable and will not last long
The general election in Italy in March 2018 produced a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 33% of the vote, and the Eurosceptic anti-immigrant Lega, which secured 17%. Following prolonged post-election negotiations, the two parties agreed to form a coalition at end-May. The administration is led by Giuseppe Conte, a law professor and an independent who is close to M5S. The leaders of M5S and the Lega, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini respectively, serve as deputy prime ministers. Giovanni Tria, an independent economist, serves as minister of economy and finance.
We expect the Conte government to be unstable and short-lived. It is likely that Mr Salvini will seek to engineer a political crisis later on this year in order to trigger an early general election in the first half of 2020-perhaps using the opportunity provided by frictions between the M5S and the EU over the budget. In this snap election we expect the Lega to emerge as the single largest formation, at the head of a broad centre-right alliance.
Turkey has completed its transition towards one-man rule
In Turkey we expect the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in mid-2016, to remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond. In mid-2018 Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president of Turkey for a second term in the first round of a snap election while the AKP secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), in an election that was mostly free, but largely unfair.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers with little oversight (including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary) and has abolished the role of prime minister. This will greatly curtail the role of parliament.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Although the government lifted a state of emergency when it expired in July 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
There is an ongoing security risk from terrorist activities by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels.
The transition to a post-Putin Russia has led to greater political jockeying
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, won a comfortable victory in the March 2018 presidential election. Although Mr Putin's re-election itself was a non-event, given Mr Putin's high approval ratings and the absence of credible opposition candidates, it has ushered in a period of political uncertainty as various factions of the elite jockey to secure their positions in the post-Putin political order-assuming that the president stands down at the end of his term in 2024 (our core forecast). This transition period will encounter an elevated degree of uncertainty owing to the weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the personalised and opaque governance system around Mr Putin.
Mr Putin's fourth term will be characterised by broad continuity in his policy agenda, which focuses on "conservative cultural values", an authoritarian political culture and overt anti-Westernism. We also expect a renewed focus on domestic policy in an effort to arrest the current decline in living standards and bolster growth following the 2015-16 recession. Even modest liberalising reforms are unlikely, and we expect the state to retain its dominant role in the economy.
On the international stage, we believe that Russia will continue to pursue a muscular foreign policy, with the aim of asserting its status as a major global player, on par with the US. Its influence will be strengthened by the conclusion of international deals in strategic sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear-power plants and military equipment.
The CIS region will be mostly stable
We do not expect political or economic upheaval in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the near term. The exceptions to this are Uzbekistan, where the new president will continue to pursue a reformist course, and Armenia and Georgia, where street protests in 2018 led to a change in government, and where economic growth will outpace that of most other countries in the region. Kazakhstan will undergo a successful managed political transition, with Kasym-Jomart Tokayev (the chosen successor of the former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev) winning a landslide victory in the June presidential election. We believe that no significant political or economic change will take place in the other central Asian countries (the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan).
Political outlook: Election watch
General elections across Europe since 2017 have confirmed rising disaffection with the political establishment, which has been reflected in the decline of the two-party system and the rise of far-right parties. Increasing political fragmentation across the region has resulted in a more complicated policymaking outlook, but has also made forming governments more difficult and given rise to the emergence of some unusual coalitions. For example, in Italy a government composed of both far-left and far-right parties is now in office.
The far right is no longer in government in Austria, but its ideas remain
Austria provides another example. Following the election in October 2017 the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP), led by Sebastian Kurz, formed a government with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). This proved unstable: in May 2019 all of the FPÖ deputies resigned after a taped conversation emerged in which the party's then leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, appears to offer public contracts to a Russian oligarch in return for campaign help. Mr Kurz subsequently lost a vote of no confidence in parliament and stepped down as chancellor. Nonetheless, with the ÖVP having shifted further to the right (especially on migration) over this period, we expect it to win the largest share of the vote again in the snap election in September 2019.
European Parliament elections result in a more fragmented EU political scene
The European Parliament elections, held May 23rd-26th, reflected similar trends to those since 2017 at the national level. There were significant gains for the liberal, centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and for the Greens/European Free Alliance, alongside a continued rise in support for nationalist, populist and Eurosceptic parties (most notably the single-issue Brexit Party in the UK). The traditional mainstream parties struggled in comparison, with the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) losing their majority for the first time.
The result, as expected, is a more fragmented political landscape, which is likely to make EU governance more complicated. The nomination process for the next European Commission will be protracted and could hamper European reform efforts; the approval of the EU's 2021-27 multiannual financial framework will be lengthy; and any major decision on trade negotiations (especially with the US) will prove to be contentious.
Nonetheless, the results from May 2019 do not pose a threat to the European project, as some had feared before the event. We consider a coalition bringing the EPP and S&D together with the Greens and/or ALDE to be the most likely eventual result, and the balance of power within the European Parliament will remain largely pro-EU-even more so once the UK leaves the bloc and its members of European Parliament (MEPs) stand down. We do not expect the hardline Eurosceptic parties, which are highly heterogeneous, to be able to form a cohesive, united front.
Recent and upcoming Ukraine elections hinge on question of corruption
Another significant election in the second quarter of 2019 was the presidential election in Ukraine in April, in which Volodymyr Zelenskyi, a comedian and television celebrity with no political experience, won a decisive victory in a second-round vote against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko. This victory was the result of a widespread popular rejection of political elites in general and of Mr Poroshenko in particular, as well as a perception that the changes promised after the 2014 revolution had never materialised. With currently no seats in parliament, Mr Zelenskyi's ability to govern will depend on the results of the parliamentary election, now due on July 21st 2019 (brought forward from October to capitalise on the momentum of Mr Zelenskyi's presidential election success). The new president has been in effect given a mandate to "clean up" the political class by the majority of Ukrainians, who see the parliament as inherently corrupt. He also has the backing of several other political forces, and we expect his party to win a majority of seats in parliament, which bodes well for political stability and legislative progress.
A number of elections in Europe are still upcoming this year. In Greece the ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, suffered a heavy defeat in the European Parliament elections (as well as regional and municipal polls the same day) at the hands of the main opposition party, the centre-right New Democracy (ND). Mr Tsipras then called a pre-term general election, which is scheduled to be held on July 7th. We expect that ND, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, will win the election and could secure a clear parliamentary majority without the need for the support of another party. Nonetheless, the next government will face formidable challenges: ND has pledged, if elected, to renegotiate the North Macedonia name-change deal-opposed by a majority of Greeks-and Syriza has left to its successor the task of correcting fiscal slippage and backsliding on structural reforms.
Fine Gael minority coalition government will not survive a full term
The Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland does not have the capacity or cohesion to address effectively the mounting economic and political challenges in the country, and our view remains that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021. We currently expect a snap election to take place in late 2019 or early 2020-although we do not expect this to produce a government any more stable or effective than the current coalition. This existing administration, led by Leo Varadkar, relies on the support of a disparate group of independent MPs, and a three-year "confidence and supply" agreement between Fine Gael and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. The agreement with Fianna Fail was extended in December, as neither Mr Varadkar nor Micheal Martin, the leader of Fianna Fail, was willing to trigger an early election while there was still great uncertainty regarding Brexit. Nevertheless, the durability of the government will be further tested by several challenges that lie ahead, including crises in housing and healthcare. There is also a public-sector pay deal to be negotiated, overspending in major departments to be managed and the awkward recalibration of the state's property tax. We expect the political environment to remain volatile, leaving the coalition vulnerable to a crisis.

Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt rows between EU members has fallen sharply since 2016, in the context of stronger economic growth across the bloc. The ECB has overcome objections in a number of countries-notably Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing (QE) has not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. There were fears that one or some euro zone countries might exit the bloc during the financial crisis; however, this scenario now seems highly unlikely, and the financial stability of the bloc looks strong despite the high public debt levels of some south European countries (such as Greece, which existed its bail-out programme in August 2018).
Italian government is testing the limits of the EU's patience on fiscal rules
The trend toward "sovereignist" and Eurosceptic politics has played out dramatically over the past year. In Italy, the government, composed of the anti-establishment M5S and the anti-immigration Lega, has tested the limits of EU rules, particularly on fiscal policy and immigration. The administration's draft government contract contained a series of incendiary proposals-such as plans for a renegotiation of the EU treaties to allow countries to leave the euro area or the EU, or the introduction of tradable tax refund notes, effectively a parallel currency, which were eventually watered down. The administration also sought to appoint a Eurosceptic minister of finance, whose appointment was vetoed by the Italian president.
Finally, the Italian government also insisted on passing an expansionary budget in 2019, which would widen the fiscal deficit from an officially projected 1.2% of GDP next year to 2.4%. In June 2019 the Commission recommended that the EU Council open an EDP against Italy for its failure to comply to the EU debt-reduction criterion in 2018. The 2020 budget negotiations are set to be difficult, as Mr Salvini has said multiple times that he will go forward with the Lega-sponsored so-called flat tax system, even if it means pushing the budget deficit wider than 3% of GDP. Meanwhile, so-called safeguard clauses built into the country's fiscal framework will raise the headline rate of value-added tax from 22% to 25.2% in 2020 if EUR23bn (1.3% of GDP) in alternative sources of revenue or expenditure cuts are not legislated in the budget. We expect a protracted dispute with the European Commission in the fourth quarter of 2019, and renewed volatility on financial markets. The opening of an EDP is likely.
Hungary and Poland will continue to clash with the EU over illiberal policies
The nationalist, socially conservative governments in Hungary and Poland have come into conflict with the EU over the EU's refugee-relocation policy and also over the creation of what the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has called-in reference to his own country-an "illiberal" state. In addition to refusing to take their allocation of refugees, the Hungarian and Polish governments have curbed the independence of the judiciary, imposed government control over the public-service media and clamped down on civil-society groups. The Commission has referred several of these measures to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), but it has so far struggled to find an effective response. Steps taken by the Commission and the European Parliament since December 2017 to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, possibly resulting in the suspension of a member country's voting rights, are unlikely to succeed; they require the unanimous vote of all members, and Hungary and Poland have made clear that they would support one another in such an event.
Turkey's foreign policy with the EU and US will be increasingly confrontational
We expect that Turkey's relationships with the EU and the US will remain antagonistic, and fundamentally transactional rather than strategic. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations between Turkey and its Western partners, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the 2016 failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; tensions with Cyprus about the delimitation of the exclusive economic zones of Turkey and Cyprus in the Mediterranean; and US sanctions on Turkish officials between August and October 2018 owing to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges.
In 2019 relations with the US will continue to be tested owing to Turkey's decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system, which the US and NATO believe can allow Russia to gather sensitive information on NATO's equipment. We expect Turkey to purchase the S-400 system regardless, as Mr Erdogan wants to assert Turkey's sovereignty. Backing down would also have a negative effect on Turkey's relations with Russia, a significant ally of neighbouring Syria. The US will have to respond, probably through limited individual sanctions on Turkish officials. In addition, the US will probably freeze Turkey's participation in the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme and delay the delivery of Turkey's F-35 jets.
We do not expect a complete collapse in Turkey's relations with the EU or the US. Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling migrant, and refugee, inflows from Syria and Iraq. The US will also want to avoid pushing Turkey towards Russia and Iran. However, this forecast is highly uncertain.
Russia-West tensions are at their highest level since the cold war
Political tensions between Russia and the West are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Western countries have accused Russia of financing extremist opposition parties in western Europe, employing cyber-warfare against Western targets and engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West. Meanwhile, Russia is seeking to reassert its role on the global stage and is dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in 2015, and its subsequent breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and backing of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, resulting in an ongoing conflict in this region, has led to a further deterioration in Russia's relations with the West. The Minsk II agreement, signed in 2015, is unlikely to resolve the conflict; we expect a regularly breached cease-fire and contained levels of fighting to endure. This serves Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict prevents closer Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO, which Russia would view as a direct threat to its national interests. In response to Russia's actions regarding Ukraine, the EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials, as well as on the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. We expect these mutual sanctions to remain in place over the medium term.
The EU has labelled China a systemic rival. The BRI divides opinions
The EU has labelled China a "systemic rival" and recently adopted a regulation setting up a framework to scrutinise foreign investments from non-EU countries, a move that is widely understood to be directed towards foreign direct investment from China. Although the EU supports improving connectivity between Europe and Asia (as pointed out in the EU Connectivity Strategy), it has not formally come out in support of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-China's flagship foreign policy initiative that aims to create a "New Silk Road" of trading routes, and to expand China's economic and diplomatic ties. However, despite the EU's hesitation to officially support the BRI, several European countries have signed onto this, including Italy, Portugal, Greece and several countries in the western Balkans. One of the points of concern for the EU regarding the BRI is the near monopoly that Chinese companies enjoy in implementing these projects. Until transparency regarding the terms of BRI funding improves and the procurement processes are made more inclusive and competitive (allowing for participation from European companies), the EU is unlikely to change its stance on the BRI.
Macroeconomic policy
The Franco-German axis will drive foward some euro zone reform plans
The commitment in 2012 by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning-point for the bloc. In 2017 EU leaders renewed their push for further integration of the economic and monetary union to boost the bloc's resilience to future shocks, and in June 2018 Germany and France presented a shared set of proposals. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects progress to remain patchy.
We do not expect the emergence of the type of full fiscal integration that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been pushing for, but the strength of the Franco-German axis, with support from a number of southern member states, is likely to be sufficient to lead to a relatively ambitious set of reforms, which will nevertheless take several years to implement fully. These would include reform of the current bail-out fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which could be turned into something akin to a version of the IMF. Such a move could shift the responsibility for fiscal and economic monitoring of member states away from the European Commission to the revised ESM, and include restructuring of sovereign debt as a strict conditionality to any bail-out. One of the three pillars of the banking union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which has yet to be implemented, will continue to meet political resistance from several north European member states. The planned EDIS would increase the responsibility of healthy economies for bad debts in others.
France and Germany believe that a new EU industrial strategy is a priority
France and Germany have taken the lead in pushing for a new industrial strategy for the bloc, and also a potential revamp of EU competition policy, in the wake of the Commission's decision to block the planned merger between two train manufacturers, Alstom (France) and Siemens (Germany). Both countries' ministers of the economy are pushing for a revision to EU competition law to enable such mega-mergers in the future, in order to build European champions capable of competing with the largest of their US and Chinese rivals. Their manifesto also argues for greater funding for innovation, and a European strategy to become a world leader in artificial intelligence, among other areas. They are also emphasising the need to develop more robust rules for screening inward foreign direct investment (FDI), especially from China. We expect continued French-German co-operation on these issues, with the aim of developing a more protectionist stance for the bloc.
Talks over the EU's next seven-year budgetary framework will be tough
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will start to emerge in the second half of 2019. The most contentious issue is the European Commission's proposal to increase member states' financial contributions to meet the shortfall created by the withdrawal of the UK, a major net contributor. Although some southern member states and Germany are willing to contribute more, fiscally hawkish countries like Austria and the Netherlands oppose this. Another point of controversy is the Commission's proposed introduction of conditionality in the next budget cycle, linking the transfer of funds to rule-of-law compliance. This emerged in response to the illiberal drift in countries like Poland and Hungary. The idea has created an east-west split, but we expect a version of an introduction to conditionality to be approved.
The 2021-27 budget will also include a new, small euro zone budget, after a compromise was reached between France and Germany. Far from providing a fiscal stabilisation function-as favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron-the euro zone budget will instead be channelled to countries looking to improve competitiveness and convergence. The topic has proved contentious among the so-called New Hanseatic League, a group of fiscally hawkish Nordic and Baltic countries led by the Netherlands.

Data based on national definitions.
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This created a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) started to tighten monetary policy in late 2015. In contrast, we do not expect the ECB to start tightening its monetary policy until mid-2020 at the earliest. We continue to expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in most European countries, and believe that fiscal policies will be broadly supportive of economic growth during our 2019-23 forecast period.
Fiscal policies will be supportive of growth in the euro zone
Almost all European countries improved their fiscal position in 2009-18, and there has now been a widespread repositioning towards a looser stance. Although we expect fiscal policies to now be slightly more supportive of economic growth, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The average euro zone government debt/GDP ratio was 87.2% at end-2018, but Belgium, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal all had ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the zone for many years. Although the cost of debt servicing has fallen dramatically in recent years owing to exceptionally low interest rates across the bloc, borrowing costs are set to rise gradually as monetary policy is normalised.
Some national governments are pushing back against EU fiscal rules
Within the EU, a number of national governments are showing signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. The Italian government has recently mounted a more serious challenge to euro area fiscal rules, proposing an expansionary 2019 budget that the Commission sees as violating the debt-reduction criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact. The administration eventually reached a compromise with the EU institutions on a deficit target of 2% of GDP in 2019. However, we expect the dispute between the Italian government and the Commission on Italy's fiscal plans to continue throughout this year, potentially resulting in the imposition of an excessive-deficit procedure (EDP).
The UK government has shifted towards a slightly looser fiscal stance
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016-18, but a looser policy stance was announced in late 2018, meaning that the deficit will widen slightly in 2019, to 1.6% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2018. The objective was in part to cushion the economy through a period of softer growth owing largely to the impact of Brexit uncertainty that is largely the result of Brexit uncertainty. However, Mr Hammond has stated that fiscal "discipline will remain", and we believe that policy will remain relatively tight throughout our five-year forecast period. We expect the deficit to narrow again in 2020, to 1.5% of GDP, and to 0.6% by 2023. We forecast that public debt will decline from about 87% of GDP in 2017 to less than 80% of GDP by 2022.
Fiscal performance has improved markedly across central Europe
As a result of robust economic growth and tighter controls on spending, fiscal performance has improved markedly across the central European countries in recent years, with the Czech Republic posting a budget surplus in 2018 and Poland and Slovakia both having deficits narrower than 1% of GDP. In Hungary, in contrast, fiscal loosening ahead of the April 2018 parliamentary election led to a widening of the budget deficit, to 2.2% of GDP in 2017 and 2018. We expect little change in the main trends in fiscal performance in 2019-23, except in Poland where the lowering of the retirement age and the expansion of generous social benefits will result in a widening of the annual budget deficit from 0.4% of GDP in 2018 to more than 2% by 2020. We forecast that public debt, which is the equivalent of 50% or less of GDP in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia-but is 71% of GDP in Hungary-will continue to decline in all these countries. Given Hungary's high public debt, the country's fiscal position and currency will remain vulnerable to volatility on world markets.
Higher oil prices are easing fiscal constraints in Russia
The tight budget constraints facing Russia's government are abating owing to higher global oil prices. We expect oil prices to stand at US$60-75/barrel in 2019-23-an improved but still challenging outlook for oil producers-up from an average of about US$50/b in 2015-17. However, the Ministry of Finance intends to relax fiscal policy only slightly in 2019-21. Military spending will remain high, but part of it will be redirected towards health and education, as recently promised by the president, Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, higher global oil prices-and the government's conservative oil price forecasts (retaining a US$40/b oil price assumption)-almost guarantee that revenue will outperform expectations. We expect the budget, which returned to surplus in 2018, to remain greater than 1% of GDP throughout 2019-23.
Turkey's fiscal position looks relatively solid
The public finances have traditionally been one of Turkey's most reassuring economic aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits widened the deficit to about 2% of GDP in 2018, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance-sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% of GDP in 2019 to 1.7% in 2023. The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.9% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017). The ratio will decline slightly, to about 26.6% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Macroeconomic policy: Monetary policy and exchange rates

10-year German government bond yield 0.4 0.3 0.6 1.1 1.5 1.7
The ECB's asset-purchase programme, quantitative easing (QE), came to an end in December 2018, but monetary policy conditions will remain loose, especially if growth continues to soften in the euro zone. The ECB has decided to continue reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities purchased under the QE programme "for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the main ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation". In 2019 policy rates will remain close to zero. Global uncertainty has increased in the past year, driven mainly by the US-China trade war and Brexit, which have started to weigh on growth. Combined with a slowdown in growth rates across the euro zone this means that the economic outlook for the bloc has become more subdued.
The ECB will maintain a dovish stance
At its latest meeting on June 6th the ECB adopted a dovish stance, delaying the next rate rise from early 2020 until mid-2020 at the earliest. This was in line with our existing forecast; we expect the ECB to raise its deposit rate in June 2020 and the main refinancing rate in December 2020, with policy tightening proceeding thereafter at a gradual pace. The bank also announced that the interest rate on its third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III) could go as low as -0.3% to encourage lending. Should economic conditions deteriorate further, for instance given an escalation in the US-China trade war or a "no-deal" Brexit (not our core forecast), we would expect the ECB to resume its QE programme or to cut rates again. That said, we would expect the bank to change its stance only if data revealed that global uncertainty was disrupting the "virtuous circle" between employment, labour income and consumption, which-for the moment-is holding up.
When setting interest rates, other central banks will have to weigh up the net effect of a moderating euro zone economy and greater protectionism elsewhere against their desire to normalise monetary policy. Caution is likely among European central banks, and rate rises will be gradual.
The BoE has paused its tightening cycle
The Bank of England (BoE, the UK central bank) raised its policy rate for the first time in a decade in November 2017 and again in August 2018. However, this year it has adopted a more dovish stance. The BoE revised down its forecasts for economic growth and inflation in February, citing a weaker global environment and Brexit-related uncertainty. The bank still expects domestically driven price pressure to build gradually in the forecast period, but the timing of future rate rises will depend on the nature and outcome of Brexit. We expect the BoE to delay the next increase in the policy rate until the fourth quarter of 2019. However, there is a high risk that the next rate increase will be delayed until 2020 and that policy tightening will occur at a slower pace.
In the event of a disorderly UK withdrawal from the EU at end-October (not our baseline forecast), we expect the bank to make whatever policy changes are required to support economic activity. The BoE has emphasised that it is prepared for such an outcome; a worst-case scenario used in the bank's stress tests for the banking system involves a decline in the pound's value, higher unemployment and inflation, an increase in borrowing costs and a decrease drop in property prices, of about 35% after three years. However, the UK's banking system has sufficient capital, and monetary policy would be loosened.
In Scandinavia, the Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) started its tightening cycle in December 2018, amid strong inflationary pressures and firm economic momentum. Norges Bank (Norway's central bank) also started its tightening cycle, in September 2018, and will proceed at a faster pace than its peers, with the next rise set to take place in March. Meanwhile the Swiss National Bank (SNB, Switzerland's central bank) has reduced its foreign-exchange interventions in and will closely track the policy movements of the ECB.
Turkey still faces the risk of another sharp depreciation of the lira
Turkey's economy has displayed resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, well capitalised banking sector, and dynamic and diversified private sector. Nonetheless, we expect the currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession to put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets.
After the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August 2018, the Central Bank of Turkey raised its main policy rate to 24%, from 17.75% previously. From mid-2019 to 2020 we expect the central bank to gradually lower its policy rate in response to easing inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. However, we expect inflation to remain greater than the target of 5% in 2021-23.
We expect a gradual appreciation in the lira in the second half of 2019, to a year-end exchange rate of about TL:5.70:US$1. This forecast assumes that the Turkey-US dispute will not result in damaging sectoral sanctions; that government policy will be credibly reoriented; and that the central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy stance, lowering interest rates only as price pressures fade. However, there are large risks to this forecast, with another sharp lira depreciation still a possibility. In 2020 we expect the lira rate to depreciate gradually against the US dollar as the current-account deficit widens and central banks in advanced economies re-embark on a path of monetary policy tightening.
We expect one or two rate cuts in Russia in 2019
In Russia in December 2018 the Central Bank of Russia (CBR, the central bank) increased its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 7.75%, in anticipation of the inflationary pressures expected in 2019, driven by an increase of the value-added tax (VAT) rate and the resumption of foreign-currency purchases from January 2019. However, the CBR has since said that inflation accelerated less than expected in response to the increase in the VAT rate, and that its pre-emptive rate increase in December 2018 was sufficient to offset this one-off price rise. The central bank expects above-target inflation of higher than 5-5.5% in 2019, before a return to the targeted 4% in 2020. This is broadly in line with our inflation forecast. We expect the CBR to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points once or twice in 2019. However, any downward shock to global oil prices or new sanctions on Russia would prompt the CBR to tighten policy quickly to soften the resulting depreciation of the Russian currency against the US dollar.
Many currencies in eastern Europe remain pegged to the euro
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of the Fed's and the ECB's policy trajectory. However, we do not believe that there are significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in North Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a cause for concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of a strong tourism performance, have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2019.
We expect broadly accommodative monetary policy stances in Central Asia
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, only Kazakhstan has allowed its currency to float. Given Kazakhstan's trade ties to the Russian economy, it would lose competitiveness if the tenge appreciated significantly against the rouble. Azerbaijan appears to have returned to a US dollar peg since April 2017. The monetary policy stances of oil-exporting countries such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are closely linked to oil price fluctuations, since the exchange-rate movements of these countries are closely linked to global oil prices (which determine export earnings). With global oil prices expected to remain firm in our forecast period, these countries will maintain an accommodative monetary policy, which will also support domestic economic growth.

Economic growth in the euro zone will lose momentum, but remain firm
The recovery of the euro zone economy from the global financial crisis of 2008-10 began in 2013, after the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, committed to doing "whatever it takes" to restore confidence in the euro. The recovery strengthened once this commitment was backed by a large-scale quantitative easing (QE) programme. By 2017 the euro zone's expansion had gathered sustained and broad-based momentum, and this, in turn, benefited neighbouring economies that receive EU funding and rely on EU trade. However, growth in the euro zone eased in 2018, and will moderate further in 2019. In the second half of last year the German economy stagnated and momentum softened in France, and Italy entered a technical recession.
Some of the reasons for the slowdown were temporary: adverse weather conditions, rail strikes and protests weighed on growth in France in 2018, and Germany's manufacturing sector was hit by changes to European car-emissions regulations and disruptions to freight transport. However, there has also been a marked deterioration in the external environment from 2018 and into 2019, with softer global trade and high geopolitical uncertainty, reflecting rising US-China trade tensions, the threat of a US tariff increase on EU automotive exports and the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit. Concerns about these issues, and a softening of demand across Asia, the euro zone, the UK and (to a lesser extent) the US, have fed into a decline in manufacturing data and sentiment indicators.
Against this less supportive external environment, domestic demand has remained firm, driving quarterly growth in the euro zone to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019-stronger than in the three previous quarters. High-frequency indicators such as consumer confidence, employment data and retail sales are robust, supporting private consumption, and a buoyant housing market, high capacity-utilisation levels and favourable funding conditions are fuelling investment. Across most of the bloc recovering labour markets, accommodative monetary policy and gradual fiscal loosening are supporting growth.
Nonetheless, the risks to The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast remain skewed to the downside. The most immediate risk is the US administration's threat to raise tariffs on imported European autos and auto parts (from 2.5% at present). Our core view is that the US will refrain from raising these tariffs. There is significant opposition to doing so in the US market, and with the next presidential election in November 2020, opening yet another front in the trade war would be a risky move. However, should the current dispute over subsidies at Airbus and Boeing, two aerospace companies, result in mutual tariff imposition, this would change the calculation. The German economy is particularly exposed to this threat, given its dominant role in the European automotive industry and highly open economy.
Economic growth is slowing markedly in Germany
Real GDP growth accelerated to 2.5% in Germany in 2017, the strongest annual expansion since 2011, in line with a euro zone cyclical upturn. Growth slowed to 1.5% in 2018, driven primarily by weaker car production in the second half of the year-as the industrial sector scrambled to respond to new European car-emissions tests-and by a less supportive external trade environment. Given the openness of Germany's economy-with exports equivalent to 50% of GDP, far higher than in any other of the other major world economies-this external context is a significant factor influencing growth.
We expect a substantial further slowdown, to 0.8% in 2019, owing to the impact of the less supportive external environment on the industrial and export sectors. The main driver of growth will be private consumption as the tight labour market feeds into significant nominal wage increases while the government embarks on its strongest fiscal stimulus since 2010. Investment growth will also be robust, driven by capacity constraints, skills shortages, investment in new technologies, additional residential construction and favourable financing conditions. After this year we expect a gradual strengthening of growth, to 1.7% by 2023-near its potential rate. Over the longer term, the poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain potential growth. A further challenge is that Germany's flagship industry, the automotive sector, risks being disrupted by technological change.
Growth will remain relatively solid in France, despite a slowdown in 2019-20
France's recovery from its slump in 2012 was slow by European standards, with growth recovering to its 2008 rate only in 2017, supported by a cyclical upswing in the euro zone. After real GDP growth of 2.4% in 2017, growth eased in 2018 and we forecast a sharper slowdown, to 1.2% in 2019, as external demand softens. In 2020-23 we expect annual average growth of 1.6% as recent reforms to the business environment start to bear fruit and external demand picks up. However, structural rigidities-especially regarding the tax system and the labour market-will not disappear entirely, and the country will continue to struggle to improve its competitiveness over the medium term, with often negative investor perceptions of the country likely to prove slow to change.
Italy's economy entered a recession in the second half of 2018
The Italian economy has softened since mid-2018, contracting on a sequential basis in the second half of last year. On the basis of weakening sentiment and high-frequency indicators, we now forecast real GDP growth of just 0.1% this year, after it registered 0.7% in 2018. Risks are firmly to the downside, as political and policy uncertainty, as well as flagging consumption and investment, may result in a deeper contraction than expected, pulling full-year growth into negative territory in 2019. In 2020 the euro area's third-largest economy will fare little better, expanding by a modest 0.4% in real terms, as cooling external demand in the euro area and the weight of global trade tensions and a slowdown in the US continue to hold back economic recovery. From 2021 to 2023 growth should return to closer to 1% per year on average, a respectable performance by Italian standards, but still weak in the context of euro area economies, as structural rigidities, a high level of sovereign debt, clogged credit channels and policy uncertainty continue to exert a drag on growth.
Structural reforms have improved the context for growth in Spain
In Spain, a combination of reform and austerity has given rise to a marked economic improvement since 2014. The financial sector is now in a better position, owing to reforms undertaken as part of Spain's EUR41.3bn bank bail-out process, and we believe that further episodes of instability-particularly at institutions of systemic importance-are unlikely. Meanwhile a landmark labour market reform implemented in 2012 lowered dismissal costs, clarified and narrowed the definition of unfair dismissal, reduced the collective bargaining power of trade unions, and made it easier for companies to cut wages and working hours. This has contributed to an improved domestic context for growth, supported by a more relaxed government stance towards wage growth, low interest rates and moderate inflation. We expect average annual growth of about 2% in 2019-23 (the forecast period), easing from more than 3% in 2015-18.
The recovery in Greece remains fragile, with political instability a central risk
Greece exited its third bail-out programme in August 2018, but we are sceptical that the country will experience rapid and sustained growth. Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. The recovery began in 2017 is fragile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Real GDP accelerated in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final quarter of the year. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained, at about 1.9% in 2019-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
The UK economy is suffering from the uncertainty stemming from Brexit
The UK economy was relatively resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016, but lost momentum in 2018. Real GDP growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018 as weaker global demand reduced exports, and political turmoil over the outcome of Brexit hurt sentiment and business investment. Consumer spending has held up, as softer inflation and faster wage growth (reflecting a tight labour market) has supported a pick-up in real income growth. However, Brexit-related uncertainty will persist in 2019, and we expect an extended slowdown in real GDP growth, to about 1.3%, from 1.4% in 2018.
Consumer spending growth should strengthen gradually in 2020-22-owing to pent-up demand as uncertainty recedes (assuming that a solution to the current Brexit impasse has been found and implemented by this point). We also expect business investment to firm gradually for most of the forecast period from 2020 as uncertainty recedes and capacity constraints make capital spending necessary. However, during the forecast period industrial activity will continue to be weighed by the decisions of various companies to scale down or end production in the UK. In February 2019 Honda, a Japanese carmaker, announced that it would close its UK-based plant in 2022.

The Visegrad countries will continue to post above-average growth rates
Much of central Europe faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding, such as the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) in particular, will register real GDP growth well above the EU average in 2019-23. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to begin in 2016, holding back activity in that year, but funds began to flow again in 2017-18, contributing to stronger economic activity, and projects are in progress that will support economic growth rates during 2019-23. Increased employment and soaring wages-driven in part by a tight labour market-have fuelled private consumption since 2017, and this will continue in the forecast period. We expect that growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-will remain solid, albeit slowing owing to trade tensions hurting car manufacturers and tight job markets weighing on growth. The German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Economic activity accelerated in south-eastern Europe, but is now moderating
In south-eastern Europe the economic recoveries are continuing, although growth has generally lost momentum. In the region's largest economy, Romania, the economy grew by 4.1% in 2018 after growth of 7% in in 2017. We expect continued weak employment growth related to large demographic constraints, with a less certain global environment and the volatile policy environment weighing on economic growth in 2019. In 2020-23 we forecast average real GDP growth of abou 3.4%. The economy will remain excessively reliant on exports and consumption, with internal investment far below the levels required for achieving convergence with the EU. In Bulgaria, a recovery in domestic credit growth, a strengthening labour market and firmer real wage growth have underpinned the acceleration of economic growth in recent years. In 2019-23 we expect growth to decelerate to 2.7% per year on average, reflecting less favourable global conditions and labour capacity constraints.
Structural imbalances in the western Balkans have been largely corrected
Economic activity in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) broadly picked up in 2015-18, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices in 2015-16 and a strong pick-up in demand from the euro zone in 2017. In 2018 the Serbian economy accelerated, bringing up the regional average after a decade of uneven growth. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the western Balkans should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans of about 3.3% in 2019-23.
Exchange-rate volatility has pushed Turkey into a recession
In Turkey government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2017 (from 3.3% in 2016), but this surge exacerbated internal and external discrepancies. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018.
The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to continue in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a contraction in full-year real GDP of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
Growth in Russia will slacken this year
According to Russia's Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Russian real GDP grew by a surprisingly strong 2.2% in 2018-the fastest growth rate since 2012. The strong growth rate was largely driven by the inclusion in output data of investment in construction work at the third phase of the Yamal gasfield, as well as high levels of exports. This is unlikely to be sustained in 2019 owing to weaker growth in external demand, a new deal with OPEC to constrain oil production, and a lower projected grain harvest. Domestic demand is also likely to slacken this year owing to higher interest rates and an increase in value-added tax (VAT). International sanctions-and broader political and business uncertainty-will remain significant constraints on investment, as will the lack of a "culture of failure" (the absence of entrepreneurial spirit weighs heavily on innovation and investment). We forecast that economic growth will ease to 1.2% in 2019. In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low productivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth, to an annual average of 1.6% in 2019-23.
The possible end of Russian gas transit represents a large risk for Ukraine
Real GDP decreased by a cumulative 16.4% in Ukraine in 2014-15 amid conflict and a chaotic political situation. The disruption of these years accentuated a structural change in the Ukrainian economy away from heavy industry and towards agriculture. The economy has been recovering since 2016, driven by vigorous growth in private investment and private consumption. Real GDP growth stood at 3.3% in full-year 2018. Household spending continued to increase (supported by solid wage growth and high inflows of remittances) and investment remained robust. In 2019-23 we expect average annual average real GDP growth of about 2.7% per year, with household consumption making the largest contribution to GDP growth in each year. However, soft global steel prices, rising production costs and a worsening external environment will weigh on growth, especially in 2019-20. The probable end of Russian gas transit in 2019 or 2020-when the current transit contract expires and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to the EU is supposed to begin operations-represents a significant risk.
Growth rates in the CIS will be similar in 2019 to those recorded in 2018
Growth and exchange-rate movements in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are highly correlated to movements in global oil prices, especially in large oil exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Owing to important trade links and high levels of remittance flows, the performance of the Russian economy has an impact on that of smaller countries in Central Asia (the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) and the South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia, not CIS members). We forecast growth of 1.2% in Russia, 1.8% in Azerbaijan, 3.9% in Kazakhstan and 2.7% in Ukraine in 2019. Given our forecast for an oil price corridor of about US$60-75/barrel in 2019-23, the growth outlook for most countries is unlikely to diverge significantly from their 2018 final outturn.

Price pressures remain modest in Europe, but are building gradually. Inflation in the euro zone accelerated to 1.7% in 2018 from 1.5% in 2017 (and 0.2% in 2016), but this increase stemmed chiefly from higher energy prices, which have since reversed course. Nevertheless, in 2019 we expect domestic price pressure-stemming from tighter labour markets and firmer wage growth-to become increasingly responsible for driving inflation higher, offsetting a diminishing contribution from external price pressure. We forecast average inflation in the euro zone of 1.3% in 2019 and 1.8% per year in 2020-23. In the EU28 we expect inflation to average 1.9% per year throughout the forecast period. The most notable exception from this pattern is Turkey, which will struggle to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% official target in our forecast period.

Business environment rankings cover 82 countries
The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of 11 categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into 11 categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2014-18) and the forecast period (2019-23), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair are, in most countries, well under way. Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America, and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe, and Asia and Australasia, but it performs better than Latin America, or the Middle East and Africa.
EU countries and Nordics score particularly well in our rankings
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Business environment in eastern Europe has improved since 1990s
The investment climate of central and eastern Europe has improved considerably in recent years. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even there. Factors such as a low-cost, but well-qualified, labour force, proximity to developed markets, and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region over the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. Throughout the region, the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable. In Russia, the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the Russian government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. However, low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to seek to open up and diversify their economies.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]the disconnect between Nigeria's south and mainstream politics is unlikely to heal. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. [...]in Mr Buhari's first term, it was clear that military engagements in other parts of Nigeria have priority when it comes to deploying the army's thinly spread resources, and the same is likely to be true in his second. [...]Nigeria's economic outlook is bleak, with growth barely keeping pace with a rapidly increasing population. [...]investor interest will be short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off assets for a low price.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufacturing goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016).
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Oil prices and exports will fall in 2019-20 but so will imports. Both imports and exports will then expand in 2021-23 but a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but capital controls will not be necessary barring another (not expected) oil price crash.
2021-23: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will markedly increase the fiscal cost of the civil service.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically following the completion of the 2019 elections, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won a presidential election in February 2019 and will remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. For any Nigerian leader, managing the country's myriad security threats would be an insoluble challenge, but under Mr Buhari there are particular reasons to expect serious, albeit localised unrest.
The election revealed a deep sense of voter apathy in southern Nigeria-an economically vital region, although prone to militancy and separatism. In his first term Mr Buhari was seen by many in the southern region as absent, rarely making visits there. With the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) vote share being heavily concentrated in Nigeria's north-and with that region facing various and urgent security issues-government attention will probably remain focused there. As a result, the disconnect between Nigeria's south and mainstream politics is unlikely to heal. Indeed, the government will give priority to containing banditry in the very far north-west and the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which is resurgent in the north-east and is utilising new tactics and more sophisticated hardware. Mr Buhari's "zero tolerance" approach to terrorism was a major reason for the strong turnout and support for him in the affected regions, and steadily worsening security in states such as Borno means a concerted response is forthcoming. As was the case in his last tenure, substantial federal resources are likely to be channelled towards restoring law and order in the region. However, militants in the oil-producing south cite the use of oil earnings for far-flung causes such as combating Boko Haram-rather than for local development-as justification for the insurgency. Our assumption is that attacks by aggrieved militants on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state.
Boko Haram will probably be aggressively countered, but in the process the north-east of Nigeria will essentially become a low-level conflict zone. Just to the south of this region, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, a more insoluble challenge will be addressing extremely violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for increasingly scarce water and land resources. Formal land titling is a potential answer, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Moreover, in Mr Buhari's first term, it was clear that military engagements in other parts of Nigeria have priority when it comes to deploying the army's thinly spread resources, and the same is likely to be true in his second. Again, the direct security impact of the conflict will be localised, with little spillover into the administrative capital, Abuja, or the economic capital, Lagos. The entire country will feel the secondary effects, however, in the form of constricted food supply and high consumer prices.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The election in February 2019 reaffirmed a deep electoral divide between the APC-supporting north and southern Nigeria, a stronghold of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). In the next general election in 2023, custom dictates that the candidates of both main parties will be southerners, giving the PDP a chance to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the 2019 presidential vote. This low participation is largely what cost them victory. Moreover, Nigeria's economic outlook is bleak, with growth barely keeping pace with a rapidly increasing population. Much of the cause of rising poverty and high unemployment will be political in origin; the parliamentary election gave the APC a large majority in both houses which in theory, should allow for the swift passage of legislation, but Mr Buhari's first term was marked by divisions between the executive and parliament (as had happened to presidents before him), and crucial bills including the national budget were delayed by months. As legislators typically prioritise the interests of their constituents over party and federation in Nigeria, similar tensions could easily reoccur in Mr Buhari's second stint which will prevent meaningful reform (for example on managing the oil sector). Inactivity on such fronts means the APC will be the subject of voter frustration. The PDP candidate should be able to capitalise from this, giving them an edge from the start.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian import restrictions) could strain ties. Relations with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second and final term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be pursued. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies, and Mr Buhari will not willingly attempt to dismantle consumer price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system will be off-putting to investors fearing a return of capital controls. Concerns about this will be heightened whenever global crude prices soften and foreign reserves decline (as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects in 2019-20).
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but again no structural reforms (such as full or partial privatisation) will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC become profitable rather than relinquish state control over them entirely. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint-ventures that it has with international oil companies, but demand will be held back by the difficulty of operating in Nigeria and uncertainty about fiscal terms (with deep political divisions about how to distribute hydrocarbons revenue having stalled critical legislation). As a result, investor interest will be short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off assets for a low price. As a consequence, the NNPC will remain dominant, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Instability in many parts of the country will also impede collection. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, while budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day (b/d)-a level not seen since the oil price slump, and one that will be unobtainable given underinvestment and OPEC production quotas. In all, federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.9% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2022 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the roll-out of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, fiscal flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit averaging 1.9% of GDP over 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20, notwithstanding a small rate cut by the CBN in March (which was upheld in May). Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise over 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above or around the target. However, real interest rates will be too high to be viable for much of the private sector.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019-20 the economy will be held back by power shortages, insecurity, high inflation and tight credit conditions, notwithstanding a recent 50-basis-point drop in the policy rate. Some sectors will benefit from targeted protectionist policies (via exchange-rate restrictions for imported goods), but this will be at the expense of preventing further rate cuts by the CBN and more broad-based growth. A slower global economy will also hold back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and inflation gradually comes down (allowing for some monetary easing) the rate of growth will quicken, although remain well below potential at an annual average of 3.3%. This is still abnormally low for Nigeria, especially as we forecast population growth of 2.6% a year for the 2019-23 forecast period.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will be a new driver of condensate output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans, as well as power supply gaps. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism affecting trade, tight credit conditions affecting areas such as real estate and finance, and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will remain elevated at 11.8% in 2019, as a 67% increase in the minimum wage combines with recently loosened monetary policy, disruptions to local food supply and widening import restrictions. In 2020 inflation will remain well above the CBN's targeted ceiling of 9%, at 10.9%, as demand-side forces from the minimum-wage rise continue. With the base effects from this fading, inflation will gradually ease over the rest of the forecast period, to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Conflict and supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's agricultural heartland-will prevent a faster slide, together with widening protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food and manufactured goods. Currently 43 items are barred from foreign-exchange access, the most recent addition being textiles, and the CBN wants to increase the list to 50 as a means of stimulating non-oil activity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. For this reason, the set-up is not expected to be tampered with. Although we anticipate a fall in exports over 2019-20, the decrease will not be steep enough or sustained to a point where devaluation of the official naira:US dollar exchange rate will be necessary. Over this period flat or declining interest rates in the US (we expect a 50-basis-point drop to be executed by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, in 2020) will also support foreign-exchange supply via portfolio inflows. Higher world crude prices thereafter mean a flat official rate is likely throughout the forecast period. In real terms, currency stability (for both the official and more market-determined rates) means real appreciation of the naira against trading partners in 2019-20 as inflation remains high. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue or allowing more market-determined rates to weaken in order to regain international competitiveness. However, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, is set against the idea and so devaluation is not included in the core forecast.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The profile of export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. In 2019-20, output gains will be outweighed by a drop in world crude prices, as well as periodic pipeline outages disrupting supply. Only in 2021-23 when prices recover and Nigeria begins to sell refined oil overseas (a new mega-refinery being developed is expected to be export-oriented) will export earnings grow.
Nigeria's government actively promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural produce). However, this policy is oriented more around stimulating local industry than reducing imports per se, and an overvalued naira will contribute to fairly strong consumer demand. Imports will only fall slightly in 2019-20, however, reflecting lower world crude prices (Nigeria imports almost all its petrol requirement). As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and world oil prices rise, imports will then grow faster. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will average 1.4% of GDP in 2019-20, widening again to 2.4% of GDP over 2021-23 as oil prices strengthen and the new refinery comes on stream.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly. [...]that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty offers credible. [...]violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the line in the sand that provokes some sort of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. [...]power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable, and we currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures, and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we assume that there will be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and Europe of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry.
The pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands for some politically difficult reforms from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2019-23, up from 80th in the historical period. Assuming regime change, we do expect improvements, but it will take time for reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment to bear fruit.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Large-scale emigration of skilled labour complicates hiring.
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid means that rationing and unpredictable blackouts continue. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$18bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply let to increasing import dependence. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable, and we currently base our forecasts on a political transition within our five-year forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures, and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we assume that there will be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
Our forecast for regime change is based on the extent of the economic and humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Venezuela. This has deeply damaged support for Mr Maduro among the population at large; we believe that it will ultimately erode support for Mr Maduro among key supporters in the military who currently prop him up in power. It is less clear, however, what the exact trigger for regime change will be. There are three main paths to a political transition: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the risk of military action, by the US or Colombia, is very low; although negotiations have been ongoing in recent weeks, we believe trust issues on both sides will be insurmountable and do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis.
On this basis, we believe the most likely scenario for regime change is some sort of internal coup. With US sanctions adding to the problem of dollar scarcity, Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee the regime's raison d'etre-the enrichment of its members-and we expect pragmatists within government and within the military to turn on him and pave the way for some sort of political transition. However, a failed uprising in late April demonstrated the difficulty of this sort of effort: some high-ranking members of the military were apparently negotiating with Mr Guaidó in April before backing out of the coup attempt at the last minute. But April's failed uprising did seem to confirm the existence of further cracks among the regime's ranks, and at the same time it is clear that lower-ranking members of the military are deeply dissatisfied. On this basis, our forecast for regime change still stands.
This forecast is underpinned by three key assumptions. Firstly, that regime pragmatists will prevail over hardliners. Despite the ongoing collapse of the patronage system, there are risks to this assumption, considering frequent purges within the military and the presence of dozens of important military figures, leading to co-ordination problems. Secondly, that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a government transition is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this forecast come in the form of greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities that could be providing the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
We recognise the very high risks to our baseline view, and believe there are two main alternate scenarios. The first, and more likely, alternate scenario is the maintenance of the status quo, with the regime hunkering down, the opposition deflating, and the country becoming increasingly isolated and impoverished. The second scenario is one of prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict among regime factions. That said, we expect neither of these scenarios to be tenable in the medium to long term: with no prospect of real reform, we believe that a chronically weak economy will ultimately make Mr Maduro's position untenable. Moreover, violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the line in the sand that provokes some sort of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. For these reasons, we continue for now to believe that regime change in the forecast period remains likely, even if it does not occur in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. Although this timeline is extremely ambitious given the scale of the task, we tentatively expect national elections to take place by the end of 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming. The task will be huge, as deep reforms to the electoral authority, to the electoral registry and to the voting system will be required, and rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised his presidency. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative lacks international legitimacy. However, if tension ratchets up and domestic violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and the state oil company, PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in terms of investment, and we believe that Russia and especially China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt to protect their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy to rein in hyperinflation and to abandon foreign-exchange controls (with few foreign reserves left to protect). However, we believe such efforts are doomed to failure without comprehensive microeconomic reform and improvements in rule of law and policy predictability that will not be forthcoming under the present regime.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations such as the US and Europe of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands for some politically difficult reforms from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$46bn in 2020-23) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect that the non-financial public-sector deficit this year will be well into double digit levels as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Under our expectation of substantial currency adjustment, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise dramatically in coming years; however, our forecasts assume that a combination of debt restructuring and deep fiscal adjustment gradually bring the debt ratios under control. The process will be complicated, however, by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. However, other investors have taken claims to the courts, and the results of these court battles will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining company, Crystallex, is seeking to collect an arbitration award by seizing shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. A ruling on the treatment of PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the government is pending, and will have implications for future debt restructuring. Following the imposition of sanctions on January 28th, the US government now considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but nonetheless, the risk of seizure of Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments, will remain high in the short term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year has had a temporary stabilising effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise somewhat in recent weeks. On the basis that this measure is insufficient to tackle underlying inflation pressures, we expect monthly inflation to rise again in the short term. But based on our assumption that a transition government that places a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation will soon come to power, we do not currently project a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced during 2018 (though there are substantial political risks to this forecast). Instead, under a new government, we expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of an emergency macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency, a temporary peg or outright currency substitution in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 18.5% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 60% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.
Our forecast for a recovery in investment from 2020 assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment. We expect oil output to bottom out at 700,000 barrels/day (b/d) over the coming quarters, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2019-23) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will start to recover in 2020 on the back of the oil sector recovery, but an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb some of the projected increase in oil output. At the same time, import demand will rise sharply in 2020. All this will constrain the rebound of GDP initially, but in 2022-23, we do expect real GDP growth to gather some pace.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, dollar constraints on import capacity, and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant gap between these data and other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. These data have shown some disinflation in recent months, with monthly inflation falling below the hyperinflation "threshold" of 50% per month. Huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand persist, however, and we expect inflation to remain extremely high for as long as the Maduro regime remains in power. On the basis of our assumption of regime change in the short term, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast of a political transition later in 2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) to try to tackle the inflation problem is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such moves is hard to predict. Our forecasts currently assume extremely large currency adjustments that restore some competitiveness to the local currency in real terms over time. For now, and with few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime has announced a loosening of currency controls. However, access to dollars via formal means will remain extremely difficult, and we believe that the foreign-exchange system will remain highly controlled in practice. In this environment a strong black-market exchange rate premium is likely to re-emerge, although in mid-June this was small by historical comparison, with the official rate at around BsS6,500:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of over BsS6.350:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We have revised our current-account data in line with the recent publication of official data for 2017-18 by the BCV, which show that Venezuela continued to post current-account surpluses in the period on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. However, we continue to project a shift into current-account deficit this year, bearing in mind the collapse of export earnings stemming from US sanctions on the oil trade. This deficit will emerge despite the non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). We have also excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data, on which our debt forecasts are based. Later in the forecast period we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, but we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been severely reduced. These factors will keep the current account in deficit, although we expect the latter to narrow to a manageable level of around 3% of GDP towards the end of the forecast period.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. It hinges on substantial IMF finance, rapid macroeconomic stabilisation, the fast resolution of a debt-renegotiation process, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: [...]the issue is likely to fester in the lead-up to the federal election. [...]the Liberal government plans to impose the same federal carbon tax on the province of Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. [...]the Canadian dollar will depreciate this year, on average, against its US counterpart, to stand at C$1.34:US$1.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October 2019 election. However, it will be a tight contest and the government is likely to lose its majority.
The renegotiation of NAFTA has eased trade uncertainty, but we expect delays in the ratification process of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA; NAFTA's successor), possibly until 2020. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its key export market.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.6% in both 2019 and 2020, as private consumption growth moderates and an economic slowdown in the US dampens export demand. Real GDP growth will average 2.2% per year in 2021-23.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.8% in 2019, from 2.2% in 2018, reflecting recent monetary tightening, weaker external demand and generally lower oil prices. Inflationary pressures will ease further in 2020, in line with a subdued economy, before picking up from 2021 as growth regains momentum.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. We expect it to keep rates on hold in 2019-20, owing to the weaker economy and housing market, and the benign outlook for inflation. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. The merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period.

Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.
2021-23: The government completes its update of financial legislation, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
The labour market
2019-20: Canada will enact policies to streamline processes and increase quotas to expedite the hiring of foreign talent by companies.
2021-23: The government further encourages the entry of skilled workers and professionals by raising its immigration target.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Work begins on the Trans Mountain Expansion project, which will pipe additional crude oil from Alberta, although further legal challenges could slow progress.
2021-23: After years of uncertainty, pipelines to carry energy resources from Alberta begin to come on stream.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The technology sector benefits from workers moving from the US, especially those on that country's H1B visas, for whom the political climate becomes more difficult.
2021-23: Expertise in artificial intelligence takes root, particularly in the academic centres of Toronto and Montreal.

Background: The Canadian economy was the tenth-largest in the world in 2018 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 75% of its goods exports and is the source of 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue; just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French-speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the two leading political parties in the province is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party heads a majority government since winning the general election in 2015.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. In 2016 the government introduced a new top marginal rate of personal income tax of 33%, which applies to taxable income over C$210,371 (US$157,706) in 2019.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$17bn in 2018 and the current-account deficit was US$45.3bn (2.6% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party government, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, won a majority at the federal election in 2015, ending a decade of Conservative rule. The government has made notable progress on its reform agenda. However, controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case has tarnished Mr Trudeau's political brand, and friction with provincial administrations over environmental policy is intensifying. Although the Conservatives are currently ahead in opinion surveys, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party to regain ground in the coming months and remain in government after the next federal election in October 2019. However, the Liberals are likely to fall short of a parliamentary majority, raising the prospect of legislative gridlock.
Mr Trudeau's popularity has been significantly damaged by his mishandling of allegations by the former attorney-general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, that he and his officials put inappropriate political pressure on her to abandon the criminal prosecution for alleged fraud of SNC-Lavalin (a large Quebec-based construction and engineering firm, which denies all charges). Ms Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, resigned from their positions, citing a lack of confidence in the government. They were both expelled from the caucus in April and will run as independents in October. As a result, the issue is likely to fester in the lead-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments has intensified in recent months, owing mainly to disagreements on environmental legislation. Opposition parties have taken control of several provincial governments in recent years, setting the stage for policy battles ahead of the federal election. The most significant change of power has been the return to provincial government in Alberta of the United Conservative Party, which defeated the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) government at the provincial election in April. The new Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, is a vocal critic of the federal Liberal government's environmental policies, which he argues have harmed Alberta's resource-based economy. In late May he repealed the carbon tax in the province introduced by the former NDP government. As a result, the Liberal government plans to impose the same federal carbon tax on the province of Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. The imposition of the carbon tax in these provinces, and the nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project, has raised questions over federal jurisdiction. The Trans Mountain expansion, designed to carry additional crude oil from Alberta to a port in British Columbia (BC), is opposed by the NDP provincial government in BC and by environmentalists, and the federal cabinet's decision on June 18th to proceed with the project will be controversial.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition Conservative Party has overtaken the Liberals in opinion surveys since the SNC-Lavalin affair in February. According to an average of recent polls published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on June 10th, the Conservatives were supported by 35.3% of respondents, compared with 29.6% for the Liberals. The NDP was well behind, in third place, backed by 15.4% of those surveyed. Mr Trudeau's approval rating is now slightly below that of the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer.
We nevertheless expect the Liberal Party to be in a position to form a minority government after the federal election in October 2019, reflecting the advantages of incumbency, and the implementation of much of the government's agenda, including the legalisation of cannabis.
However, the contest will be tight. Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and are building momentum under Mr Scheer. They will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes, government spending and the cost of its climate change policies. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing over 40,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Under the Liberals, Canadian foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. This is in clear contrast to the policies pursued by Donald Trump's administration in the US. As a result, bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration. Canada will, nonetheless, seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far. Where possible, Canada will attempt to circumvent the White House by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The signing in November 2018 of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA and preserve the trilateral arrangement, mitigates significant trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier deal. In particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which Canada relies on to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. It also grants the US greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). Canada also negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports. The lifting in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports has removed a key obstacle to ratification of the USMCA. However, the timing for ratification of the agreement poses a challenge for all three administrations. Ongoing delays on the US side, and Canada's parliamentary recess from June 21st until November will complicate the ratification process in those two countries. Our central forecast is that the USMCA will be ratified by all three nations, but this process could be delayed until next year. Downside risks to ratification will nevertheless grow as time passes, owing to the start of the presidential election season in the US.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to key Asian markets over the forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines. With full implementation, the figure is set to rise to 99%.
China was a key target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities on fraud charges (that she denies). Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. In March the Canadian government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition. In response, China has detained two Canadians, sentenced two others convicted of drug crimes to death and blocked canola (rapeseed) imports, on the alleged grounds of biosecurity concerns. We expect tensions to persist, preventing progress on exploratory free trade.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government will seek to support domestic industries that are adversely affected by US trade protectionism and Canada's trade issues with China. In 2018 the finance minister, Bill Morneau, announced measures to increase the competitiveness of Canadian businesses after the introduction of tax cuts in the US at the start of last year. These included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. However, the government will struggle to balance environmental policy with support for the fossil fuel industry. On the one hand, the government has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20/tonne (US$15/tonne) in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. The federal tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. On the other hand, the federal government has approved the controversial C$7.4bn (US$5.5bn) expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which it now owns. The project still faces some regulatory hurdles, and the start of construction work could be delayed further by legal challenges.
Policymakers will continue to keep a close eye on the residential property market, which remains a key risk owing to monetary policy tightening last year and overleveraged Canadian households. Measures introduced by the federal government and provincial governments in Ontario and BC have helped to cool the housing market. In Vancouver and Toronto, foreign buyers are now subject to a 15% tax on property purchases, while the federal government has tightened mortgage requirements nationwide, which has improved the quality of new mortgage lending. Price growth has slowed markedly, with some measures showing a dip in house prices since late 2018, although trends vary across the country. We expect the housing market to remain sluggish in 2019, reflecting a combination of tighter lending standards, continued affordability pressures, and diminished investor activity, although a major correction is unlikely in the absence of higher interest rates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure and other spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but this will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the introduction of the carbon tax and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018 will weigh on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit, as increased government support will be expected to shore up the economy and government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. Official projections show the budget deficit declining to C$9.8bn, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, by 2023/24. We project that the fiscal deficit will expand from 0.4% of GDP in 2018 (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based) to, respectively, 1% of GDP in 2019 and 1.2% of GDP in 2020. The government will look to narrow the deficit in the longer term, and we expect it to fall gradually, to 0.7% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points between July 2017 and October 2018, in response to rising inflation, and to discourage highly indebted households from accumulating further debt. However, the BoC has kept rates steady at its last five scheduled interest-rate meetings, owing to lower energy prices late last year, which pushed down the headline inflation rate in early 2019, and slowing real GDP growth in the first quarter. The central bank is in no hurry to resume the process of returning interest rates to what it considers a neutral level, which it believes stands between 2.25% and 3.25%.
Given the benign outlook for inflation, weak household spending growth, the soft housing market and a loss in global economic momentum, we expect the BoC to leave the policy rate unchanged throughout 2019. We forecast that rates will remain on hold in 2020 as US growth slows further; because of the close ties between the two countries, this will weigh on economic growth in Canada. Modest monetary tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to an upwardly revised 1.9% in 2018, from 3% in 2017, and we expect the pace of economic expansion to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. Previous monetary tightening, high household debt levels and the subdued housing market will weigh on private consumption growth this year. However, solid growth in government spending will help cushion the impact. Export growth is also expected to moderate, as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's key export market.
Much of 2018 was characterised by the escalating trade dispute with the US. The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the key downside risks to our forecast, although we expect delays (possibly until 2020) in the ratification process of the successor agreement, the USMCA. Canadian producers and manufacturers will benefit from the removal in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports, and the end of the retaliatory import tariffs that Canada imposed, but are feeling the pinch from trade restrictions imposed by China on some Canadian farm exports, such as canola. Global trade uncertainty remains a major downside risk to out forecast. Other risks to the economic outlook include a sharp drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
Growth in the US and world trade will continue to lose steam in 2020, when we expect real GDP growth in Canada to remain well below its long-term trend, at 1.6%. The pace of economic expansion is expected to pick up again in 2021, and real GDP growth will average 2.2% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued public investment in infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices throughout much of 2018 and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures last year, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation accelerated to an average of 2.2%. The inflation rate fell back to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, below the BoC's 2% target rate, owing to lower petrol prices and the impact of previous monetary tightening by the central bank. However, it has picked up more quickly than we expected, to 2.1% year on year in May. In light of this, we have revised up slightly our forecast for consumer price inflation in 2019, which we now expect will average 1.8% (previously 1.7%). Subdued economic growth and generally lower oil prices will lead to a further easing in the inflation rate next year, before it picks up again from 2021 as the economy strengthens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Tighter monetary policy, a broader improvement in the global economy and the draining of the surplus in the oil market lent support to the Canadian dollar in the first half of 2018, but falling oil prices and weakening growth weighed on the currency late last year and in early 2019. As a result, the Canadian dollar will depreciate this year, on average, against its US counterpart, to stand at C$1.34:US$1. Downward pressure on the Canadian dollar from continued soft economic growth and oil prices next year will be mitigated by interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), keeping the local currency broadly unchanged in 2020. A pick-up in growth from 2021, and the resumption of monetary tightening, will underpin a modest appreciation in the Canadian dollar over the remainder of the forecast period, with the currency forecast to average C$1.30:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. The merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will therefore remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period. The CPTPP, the effects of which will first be felt at the start of the next decade, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. We expect that this will help to narrow the current-account deficit to 2.4% of GDP in 2023.

Full text: Ecuador--highlights: Political outlook
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Lenín Moreno, to continue to decline in popularity for the remainder of his term (ending in 2021) as his administration implements austerity measures and structural reforms as part of an IMF-backed economic programme. Mr Moreno will maintain a tenuous advantage over the fragmented opposition after securing sufficient support from opposition parties to make headway on certain structural reforms, including labour market liberalisation policies. More contentious reforms, namely tax reform measures, will weigh on political stability and governability. Although there is not an indication of who is running for Mr Moreno's party in the 2021 election, we expect a victory for a centre-right opposition candidate, such as Jaime Nebot. Provided that Mr Moreno doesn't exercise executive powers to push through reforms, we would not expect major policy reversals.

Some improvements in the business environment are likely under Mr Moreno's more market-friendly admin-istration, particularly in terms of official policy towards foreign investment and private enterprise. However, structural impediments such as weak legal security, inadequate access to local finance, the small market size and continued political risk will prove much more difficult to tackle. This explains why Ecuador continues to rank poorly in our business environment rankings. A modest uptick in investment is likely, but many investors are likely to steer clear until the government has demonstrated a solid and longer track record of policy stability.
Ecuador--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP growth (%) 1.4 0.2 1.1 2.0 1.9 2.2
Consumer price inflation (av, %) -0.2 0.3 1.9 2.3 2.6 2.6

Exchange rate US$:US$ (av) 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
The high public spending and investment that formed the pillars of growth under the former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), will abate as Mr Moreno moves ahead with fiscal adjustment measures. Cuts to capital expenditure and a slowdown in consumption will keep growth weak. Following a small current-account deficit in 2018, the current has widespread support, as it has delivered macroeconomic stability and helped to tame inflation. As part of the government's IMF-backed economic programme, we expect a build up international reserves and measures that reinforce the foundations of dollarisation in 2019-23.
Ecuador--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2013 2018 2023
Total 15.8 17.0 18.2
 Male 7.9 8.5 9.1

Population growth   1.9 1.3
Working-age population growth   1.97 1.58
Labour force growth   2.9 1.7
Population growth is slowing because of a falling birth rate and continued, albeit lower, emigration. However, at an annual average rate of 1.3% per year in 2019-23, population growth will be on a par with that of neighbouring Andean nations. The unemployment rate will rise to 4.7% by 2020 before falling to 4.1% in 2023. Underemployment will remain high, exceeding 50%. Despite forthcoming labour reforms, Ecuador's informal sector is expected to remain substantial, owing in part to deeply entrenched labour market rigidities.

Household consumption per head (US$) 3,800 3,840 3,910 4,000 4,140 4,290
Although Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings, its significant mineral reserves will continue to attract oil and mining investors, and we expect the domestic market to grow moderately. Business opportunities outside of the extractive sectors will remain restricted by low purchasing power, with GDP per head estimated at US$6,370 in 2018 and forecast to reach US$6,951 in 2023. Persistent income inequality and anaemic growth will hinder robust growth in household consumption.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, provided that policies are implemented to transform its resource wealth into productive investment in other sectors. Ecuador will benefit from dollarisation and incremental improvements to the business environment. However, poor prospects for significant improvements to Ecuador's institutions do not bode well for a more stable economic policy direction. Assuming persistent structural deficiencies and inconstant policymaking decisions, we forecast that long-term investment will be lacking and income levels will continue to trail OECD levels in the long term.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions are fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protests since 1997. The current president, Lenín Moreno, took office in May 2017, succeeding Rafael Correa (2007-17), the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the re-introduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved in a referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation and has strengthened Mr Moreno's political power to a certain extent, persistent social and fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on governance.
Political structure: The political system is fragmented. Mr Moreno's Alianza País lost considerable standing in recent municipal elections. The 2008 Constitution granted more power to the executive, but has done little to foster the institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability, but has also exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitiveness. Reforms are needed to address business environment deficiencies, which include inefficient and costly utilities, legal insecurity, a rigid labour market and low skill levels. Mr Correa adopted expansionary fiscal policy in 2007-17, facilitated by high oil prices. Mr Moreno will not be as lucky: oil prices will remain modest by the standards of the previous decade during the forecast period, which will force the government to make fiscal adjustments. The government secured external financing from multilateral organisations and the IMF after borrowing in international capital markets became unsustainable, given high risks resulting from liquidity issues. This will lead to a bolder fiscal adjustment, with a three-year IMF deal dictating the policy direction for the remainder of Mr Moreno's administration (ending in 2021).
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador posted a trade deficit of US$263m in 2018 (compared with a US$312m surplus in 2017), as a pick-up in imports surpassed oil export revenue. Efforts to boost competitiveness will produce a trade surplus in 2019-23.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Ecuador has a multi-party democracy. The centre-left president, Lenín Moreno, from Alianza País (AP), took office in May 2017 for a four-year term, after winning a run-off against Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo). At the onset of Mr Moreno's term, the president's party had a legislative majority, but following a power clash with his predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17), the AP split in 2018 with Mr Correa's supporters forming a new political bloc, Revolución Ciudadana (RC). Lacking a majority, Mr Moreno counts on support from opposition parties.
The biennial reorganisation of the National Assembly in May 2019 gave rise to a novel legislative pact between the AP, Creo and two legislative blocs that include legislators from a series of small parties, among them the hard-left indigenous party Pachakutik, centre-left Izquierda Democrática, populist Partido Sociedad Patriótica and centre-left Fuerza Ecuador. The agreement provides a working majority, albeit tenuous, which allows Mr Moreno to pursue structural reforms that intend to ease employability, bolster public finances and restore central bank independence, as well as strengthen the public pension system. Explicit backing for more contentious legislation, such as tax reform, was lacking from the agreement and is likely to undermine co-operation in the second half of 2019. The redistribution of legislative committees led to the removal of the RC from the Consejo de Administración Legislativa (the legislative administrative committee), a powerful panel that vets incoming legislation, and prevents the party from presiding over any other legislative panel, effectively curtailing Mr Correa's influence in congress.

Political outlook: Political stability
For the remainder of Mr Moreno's term in office, ending in May 2021, the president will face the political challenge of implementing ambitious structural reforms and austerity measures envisaged in his economic programme, which is backed by an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF. Although the government is poised to receive a total of US$10.3bn in multilateral financing over the next three years to cover its financing needs, bolstering political stability, adjustments are bound to fuel public discontent and test the government's commitment to the programme. This is likely to put Mr Moreno, of the ruling centre-left Alianza País (AP), under increased pressure and weigh on his already-waning popularity-and hence congressional support for him.
Governability will receive a boost from the biennial restructuring of the National Assembly in May. Although Mr Moreno lacks a congressional majority-requiring 69 legislators-his party forged a deal with the largest opposition party, Creando Oportunidades, and several small parties in the National Assembly, including Pachakutik, a hard-left indigenous party. With this pragmatic alliance, Mr Moreno is likely to receive sufficient backing to make headway addressing structural deficiencies, including labour market reforms (a bill is set to be submitted later in May).
Opposition parties, however, did not offer their backing for a tax reform that is set to be introduced in October. It is likely that Mr Moreno will make concessions to opposition parties to pass revenue-raising legislation, settling for a diluted bill. This is the most likely scenario given approaching elections and the presence of obstructionist legislative blocs. The probable conservative frontrunner in the 2021 presidential election, Jaime Nebot, the leader of the second-largest opposition party, Partido Social Cristiano (PSC), has previously spoken against any sort of IMF deal and is only likely to support the tax reforms if he decides that he can capitalise on the political cost to the AP. Members of the AP and legislators that support Mr Moreno may well be hesitant to back tax hikes out of fear that they may hurt their chances of re-election. Staunch supporters of Rafael Correa, the former president (2007-17) are likely to oppose any legislation pursued by Mr Moreno.
If Mr Moreno does succeed in passing legislation without concessions or dilutions, he will incur even greater political costs, as austerity measures are likely to cause social unrest. This would intensify political instability and greatly diminish governability. A similar end-result is possible if Mr Moreno unilaterally pushes forward the tax reform through emergency legislation, which would require two-thirds of the National Assembly to overturn. This would probably result in political gridlock, engender political backlash and raise the likelihood that the next government in 2021 reverses the policies enacted by Mr Moreno.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Deeply politicised institutions, an inefficient bureaucracy, a complex and archaic tax system, and corruption have long undermined institutional effectiveness. Although the former administration of Mr Correa initially increased government effectiveness by allowing the executive to bypass a deeply fragmented legislature, Mr Correa's constitutional amendments in 2008 and 2015 tilted discretional power in the executive's favour, reducing accountability.
Mr Moreno has made moderate progress in addressing institutional weaknesses. The 2018 referendum enabled Mr Moreno to restructure the judicial appointment process, introduce term limits for the executive, enact stricter penalties for corruption, move to rationalise real estate taxation and introduce market-friendly regulations regarding mining investment. However, despite impending structural reforms as part of the government's economic programme (with guidance from the IMF), challenges will remain: bureaucratic inefficiencies will persist and lawmaking will be subject to the demands of an array of vested interests, while enforcement will be inadequate.
Weak institutional effectiveness will remain a hindrance
Under the presidency of Mr Correa there was a marked decline in the independence of the judiciary. Reforms were enacted that conspicuously augmented the degree of control that the executive had on the courts system, and led to the dismissal of hundreds of judges. Since coming to power in 2017, Mr Moreno has attempted to remove political interference from the judiciary and curb graft. Results have been mixed. Mr Moreno successfully installed a new panel of judges to the Constitutional Court after the previous court was terminated amid a cloud of allegations of wrongdoing, with investigations into alleged malfeasance including money-laundering and other financial crimes, which intensified the court's already-poor reputational standing due to perceptions of favouritism towards the incumbent political leadership. Nonetheless, inefficiency and corruption remain deeply rooted in the judicial system. The Council of the Judiciary has shown little progress in handling corruption cases, while access to legal protection and law enforcement remains flawed, and the lack of effective protection of rights persists.
Although historically Ecuador has had a relatively low crime rate, the security environment has deteriorated over the past decade. There is little chance of marked improvement, unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law-enforcement agencies. There are no home-grown terrorist organisations, but violence has spilled over from Colombia owing to a rise in drug-trafficking and related money-laundering by groups of dissident guerrillas from the FARC that oppose the peace deal signed in 2016 with the Colombian government. Mr Moreno will bolster Ecuador's existing international security co-operation efforts, through closer co-operation with the US as well as organisations such as Interpol and the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (a regional financial intelligence and anti-money-laundering network). But anti-corruption initiatives will yield few tangible results. Mr Moreno established an International Anti-Corruption Commission to advise state institutions on preventing corruption that will expire at the end of his term, but has otherwise struggled to make sweeping progress in combating pervasive corruption, weighing on political effectiveness.
Mr Moreno has been less confrontational with the police force than his predecessor, whose relations soured following a police mutiny in 2010, when officers rioted in the capital, Quito, in protest against pension reforms. There is little evidence to suggest that foreign businesses are singled out as targets for crime, but inept and inefficient law enforcement means that firms must provide their own security, increasing operational costs.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next legislative and presidential elections will be held in February 2021. At this stage, Mr Moreno has not given a clear indication of whether or not he intends to run for re-election. Provided that the current administration remains committed to implementing its IMF-backed economic programme, we expect the AP to decline in popularity and weaken the chances that Mr Moreno will run or that an AP candidate achieves a presidential victory. A candidate backed by Mr Correa is unlikely to play a significant role in the presidential election, while the centre-right PSC, which performed well in municipal elections in March, is best poised to capitalise on the fragmented political landscape and mount a strong campaign.
Political outlook: International relations
Ecuador's pro-Western foreign policy realignment under Mr Moreno augurs closer diplomatic and economic co-operation with the US, its largest trading partner. Since taking office in 2017, Mr Moreno has initiated talks with the US on a free-trade agreement (FTA), aligned his government with the US by recognising Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's interim president and, in April, ending the political asylum of Julian Assange-an Australian citizen subject to a US Department of Justice investigation for conspiring to help a former US army soldier, Chelsea Manning, access secret US military documents.
Apart from consolidating relations with the US, Mr Moreno's foreign policy is geared towards deepening trade and investment links within Latin America and with Europe and Asia, partly to help to diversify the economy away from oil. Mr Moreno has launched the Foro para el Progreso y Desarrollo de América del Sur (Prosur, a centre-right regional public-policy bloc) with other Latin American leaders and initiated Ecuador's accession to the Pacific Alliance, a regional trade bloc. However, we expect negotiations over the latter to last beyond 2023, partly because relations with neighbouring Peru and Colombia will face strains owing to Ecuador's import tariffs. The government has also sought to raise its trade profile with the EU and develop its commercial ties with China, while also cultivating relationships with other countries in Asia and the Middle East.

Ecuador scores poorly in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings and, despite improving in the forecast period, the country will remain towards the bottom of our global rankings (at 68th out of 82 countries). The improvements in Ecuador's underlying scores and comparative rankings mainly relate to changes that are being introduced by the president, Lenín Moreno. His policies are proving significantly more market-friendly than those of his predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17), who demonstrated a preference for state-led development and introduced more obstacles to an already-weak environment for doing business.
As such, the main categories in which Ecuador sees the most marked improvements are those related to government policy: the country's global ranking rises for policy towards private enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, as well as those related to taxes. This progress mainly reflects the scaling-back of state-led development in favour of a renewed push towards private investment. The government is looking at ways of fostering competition and reforming tax legislation in order to attract investment, which will improve the regulatory backdrop (albeit from a low base of comparison).
Other areas of the business environment, however, will be harder to tackle. The small size of the market, financing constraints and difficulties arising from bloated government bureaucracy will continue to weigh heavily on Ecuador's investment climate. The political situation will also remain a concern for investors. Despite the current government's more pro-market policy stance, there is little evidence of sweeping national (or congressional) support for broad-based structural reforms. Notwithstanding his current tenuous working majority, the president, whose approval ratings have already dropped sharply, may face an increasingly obstructionist congress, which would complicate governability. There is a risk that Mr Moreno's reforms might be rolled back by a successor administration. This uncertainty will continue to deter many investors and helps explain why we do not expect a dramatic improvement in Ecuador's overall business environment.

Business environment outlook: Ecuador's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Fuel subsidies are gradually rolled back. Implementation of antitrust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries, such as mining, benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2021-23: Fiscal austerity requires a scaling-back of the state-led development model. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. A new public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Overtures to foreign firms and pro-business reforms partly offset the government's continual interventionism.
2021-23: Inadequate property rights protection and questions over access to foreign arbitration deter investment. New mining projects attract investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Government maintains capital outflows tax and increases import tariffs to protect dollarisation.
2021-23: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness and government begins to phase out capital outflows tax.
Taxes
2019-20: Government introduces tax-reform legislation in 2019 (to be implemented in 2020-21) to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions will be eliminated while other burdensome regulations are simplified.
2021-23: Efforts continue to increase tax collection to support revenue growth. Tax system remains complex.
Financing
2019-20: Deposit and credit growth are moderate and support banking stability.
2021-23: Financing is still below potential as public-financing needs curb growth of long-term lending to the private sector.
The labour market
2019-20: Government takes steps to reduce public wage bill and reduce labour market rigidities.
2021-23: Quality of workforce remains poor. Labour reforms slow to take effect.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Fiscal constraints lead to cancellation of several projects. Efforts to drum up large-scale foreign investment meet with little success.
2021-23: Renewed interest in port and airport development sustains new cycle of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Investment to expand 4G broadband availability.
2021-23: Increasing adoption of civic technologies by the government. 5G technology remains in its infancy.

Ecuador's ranking for the macroeconomic environment category-by some distance its strongest area of the business environment-will remain stable in the forecast period. However, Ecuador's score is flattered by dollarisation as it keeps inflation low and reduces the risk of periods of sharp currency volatility. Other areas of the macroeconomic environment score much more weakly, including the quality of official policymaking and strength of economic institutions. The public finances are also a particularly weak area, with large fiscal deficits in recent years resulting in a sharp rise in public debt. A recently signed agreement with the IMF will provide crucial financing support and will help to guide the reform process, but the government will need to rein in public spending throughout the forecast period in order to put the economy on a stronger long-term footing.
The previous government's failure to diversify the economy significantly beyond the mainstay of the oil sector will hamper medium-term growth potential. Oil prices are likely to remain relatively contained in 2019-23 (West Texas Intermediate prices, which are a proxy for Ecuadorean oil export prices, are forecast to average US$62.7/barrel, only marginally higher than US$60.2/b in the 2014-18 historical period) and production volumes are set to remain weak. Faster sustainable rates of growth in the non-oil economy would require greater legal stability and improvements in the regulatory environment, as well as expanded access to foreign markets. Investment and structural reforms in electricity, telecommunications and fuel refining would also be needed to reduce the cost of these goods and services to competitive levels. Although we do expect some improvements in these areas, it will take time for investment to feed through to lifting output.

A slowly improving policy approach towards the private sector
Ecuador's score and ranking for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves during the 2019-23 forecast period. Its poor ranking in the historical period mainly reflects the Correa administration's erratic policy approach towards the private sector, but moderate improvements under the current president, Lenín Moreno, are under way. A preference for creating or developing state-owned companies has been abandoned, although a full reversal of state ownership is unlikely. This is likely to increase the scope for private-sector participation in some regulated sectors of the economy, including infrastructure and mining. However, a significant liberalisation of policy towards private enterprise and competition is unlikely, with monopolies and oligopolies remaining a feature of Ecuador's business environment (in particular in the cement, financial, supermarket and steel industries), while fixed prices or subsidisation in some areas will continue. Under Mr Correa, government regulations increased substantially and private-sector lobbies were able to exert less political influence over the Correa administration than in previous governments, but Mr Moreno has stronger ties to parts of the private sector, whose influence on policymaking we expect to increase. Although some modest reform progress is being achieved, high levels of bureaucracy will continue to constrain private investment and competition in 2019-23.
Although the government has indicated that it is considering welcoming foreign concessions in some state companies, we do not expect any significant moves towards full, or even part-privatisation of state-run assets during 2019-23. The main area identified so far by the government is the state-owned telecommunications company, the Corporación Nacional de Tele-comunicaciónes (CNT), with the authorities stating in early 2019 that they are looking to launch a tender for a stake in the company during the second half of the year. The country's 2019 budget includes US$1bn pencilled in from concessions; the government has stated that it is targeting US$250m per year over a 20-year horizon from the CNT concession, indicating that stakes in other public holdings are also being considered. However, we remain sceptical that this will materialise. There is significant public opposition to the sale of stakes in state assets, which is likely to hamper the government's plans. Moreover, it is unclear whether significant demand exists, as foreign firms may be deterred by mismanagement of state-run companies in recent years, as well as the fact that many lack fully audited accounts (which will complicate estimates of market value).
The Moreno government is pushing for all major infrastructure projects to be developed with private-sector investment, primarily using public-private partnership agreements (PPPs). The current PPP legislative framework is based on the Regulations for the Public-Private Partnership Regime, the Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment, and the General Regulations for the Application of the Framework Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment. These were all introduced in 2015-16 and essentially consist of tax breaks, including from import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT), during project construction, as well as a ten-year reprieve from income tax and from a tax on the repatriation of profits. However, institutional barriers will prevent the take-up of PPPs. A lack of staff at the national level with necessary resources to promote and support PPP development will hamper international interest in potential projects, while ongoing legal insecurity will also remain a concern for investors.
Bureaucracy will remain burdensome, albeit decreasingly owing to Mr Moreno's efforts to reduce restrictive regulations. The state will continue to be involved in price fixing. This practice is common for agricultural goods, agrochemicals, pharma-ceuticals, transport and some labour services. Energy prices (fuel, cooking-gas and electricity) are also fixed, representing a substantial fiscal burden. Mr Moreno has also supported the idea of subsidies in order to tackle poverty, despite fiscal pressures. Plans to lift subsidies on automotive diesel were abandoned in January. Efforts to control smuggling to neighbouring Peru and Colombia will remain in force, but progress will be slow and formal sector traders will continue to face disloyal competition from contraband.
In January 2019 new regulations clarifying the application of the Productive Development Law, originally enacted in August 2018 to encourage investment and generate employment, were published. These target export-oriented businesses, manufacturing and tourism. In addition to clarifying existing laws, the new regulations have been introduced to simplify environmental regulations and provide additional tax incentives. These include new processes intended to eliminate delays in the issuance of mining licences, streamline customs procedures and guarantee exporter liquidity.
An antitrust law was adopted in 2011 but parts of the legislation are poorly defined, in particular the scope for price setting by the government. Moreover, the anti-monopoly regulator, the Superintendencia de Control del Poder de Mercado, has limited resources, calling into question its efficacy. There have been some concerns that the legal framework provides ample ground for the government to extract concessions from industries on political grounds, at the expense of both market share and profitability, but Mr Moreno's efforts at conciliation with the private sector suggest that this will be less likely during 2019-23.

Interventionism and a burdensome bureaucracy will persist
Ecuador's score for policy towards foreign investment improves firmly in 2019-23 and its position in the global ranking rises to 59th from 72nd (although it remains unchanged in the regional ranking, in 10th place). The Moreno government is proving much more willing to engage with foreign investors. However, securing legislative support for deeper structural reforms to improve the business environment is far from certain. Ecuador's still relatively weak ranking reflects the likelihood of ongoing government intervention in key sectors, powerful domestic vested interests that will resist some of the government's reform efforts, and a weak legal framework.
The excessive cost of loans-for-oil deals between Ecuadorean state-owned enterprises, such as PetroEcuador, and Chinese entities, such as the China Development bank, the China Export-Import Bank and the China National Petroleum Company, have amounted to more than US$15bn since 2010. These loans have financed major infrastructure projects, including the US$2.6bn Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric project. This practice is likely to impel the Moreno administration to favour private-sector foreign direct investment (FDI; most loans carried rates higher than 10%, which is the average rate of Ecuadorean bonds' rates at issuance over the same period).
The government is more amenable to foreign investment, but pro-business reforms will be limited
There are successful examples of foreign investment in recent years (particularly in services, light manufacturing and banking), but private investment in oil and mining (the two sectors with most export potential) has been minimal, deterred by ongoing legal disputes between the government and foreign companies. A long-running dispute with a US oil company, Occidental Petroleum, was finally settled in late 2015, but Ecuador is still facing a number of outstanding claims at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The fact that Ecuador has renounced further participation in ICSID and has denounced (but will renegotiate) a number of bilateral investment treaties-most recently with 12 countries including the US and China, in May 2017-will continue to spook foreign investors.

Ecuador's economy has traditionally been one of the more open in the region, but repeated import and capital-account restrictions, as well as shifts in the government's stance on trade openness, has seen foreign trade as a share of GDP fall from close to 70% in 2006 to around 46% in 2018. We are not forecasting any significant improvement in the forecast period, and Ecuador's underlying score will remain unchanged, while its global and regional rankings will slip. Efforts to diversify export markets to Asia and Europe, the latter through a free-trade agreement (FTA) have seen limited success. The Correa government largely steered clear of signing FTAs with traditional markets, and-despite some limited progress on new FTA negotiations-we do not expect dramatic changes under Mr Moreno. Sporadic trade spats with regional partners are likely to continue, dragging down Ecuador's score in this area. Ecuador's terms of trade worsened in 2012-16-mainly reflecting oil price movements-and, despite improving slightly in 2017-18, they are expected to remain fairly weak in 2019-23.
Ecuador's trade integration with the US, the country's biggest export partner, will remain adversely affected by Ecuador's unilateral decision in 2013 to withdraw from the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). ATPDEA was an agreement that granted tariff-free access to the US market for around 6,000 goods. The government failed to secure an alternative trade agreement, forcing many non-traditional sectors such as cut flowers, fruit and vegetables to lose competitiveness against other Latin American countries that have maintained FTAs with the US. There are signs that bilateral ties are improving under Mr Moreno, with the US and Ecuador holding the first meeting of the two countries' Trade and Investment Council (TIC) in nine years. Representatives discussed a broad range of trade and investment-related issues, including bilateral trade and investment flows, co-operation projects, intellectual property aspects related to trade, investment issues, and trade in agricultural and fishery products. However, aside from negotiations there is little indication of a move to revive expired trading preferences.
The Correa government made some progress in streamlining custom procedures in order to improve efficiency, although corruption and drug smuggling via overseas shipments remain a problem. There are a number of electronic procedures and automation processes that have helped to speed up the delivery of goods. However, frequent changes to custom duties have acted as a major disincentive for legitimate businesses, and will continue to fuel contraband trade in 2019-23.

Ecuador's score and ranking for taxation improves solidly in the forecast period. In the historical period official tax policy stance was volatile and prone to abrupt changes in legislation to meet short-term financing needs. This fuelled uncertainty and was a major impediment to investment. However, under the auspices of the IMF agreement the current government is likely to table a tax reform bill in the second half of 2019. Although we expect a combination of congressional and public resistance to water down some of the measures, on balance we believe that it will raise tax revenue, help to lift compliance and streamline payment procedures. Over time, the Servicio de Rentas Internas (Ecuador's tax authority) will begin to establish a better reputation in terms of efficiency.
Tax reform will meet resistance but will help to raise revenue
The government has stated that it hopes a new tax reform will lift revenue by 1.5-2 percentage points of GDP by 2021. However we expect Mr Moreno will make concessions to opposition parties to pass revenue-raising legislation, settling for a diluted bill. Measures are likely to broaden the tax base, simplify the system through eliminating some tax breaks and removing some distortionary taxes on transactions and capital flows (including a 5% tax on overseas financial transfers). The government has indicated that it will unveil details of the bill before the end of August and that it will be submitted to the National Assembly by the end of October.
A progressive personal income-tax scale has been in place since 2007, with the upper limit set at 35% for those earning over US$115,000 a year. A minimum income tax threshold of US$11,270 is also in place. As in the corporate sector, ad hoc changes have become commonplace, including tax increases on luxury items and limits to tax deductions. For example, in May 2016 in response to a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, the government enacted a Solidarity Law with the purpose of financing rebuilding costs. This involved a one-time 3% surtax over the income tax basis for non-employed individuals and a one-time 0.9% net wealth tax on individuals with a net worth in excess of US$1m. A temporary contribution of 3.33% of monthly salary to be paid by employed individuals earning more than US$1,000 per month, for up to eight months, was also levied. Although the likelihood of these kinds of changes is reduced under Mr Moreno, it is not out of the question that the government might resort to putting in place new taxes, given the pressing need for fiscal consolidation.
Business environment outlook: Financing

Ecuador's score for financing in 2019-23 improves noticeably, but with similarly ranked countries also making improvements, Ecuador's global rankings remain relatively weak in this area. Indeed, financing will remain one of the worst areas of Ecuador's business environment. The country's financial sector remains underdeveloped in relation to the size of the economy; financial services are relatively rudimentary, with a small secondary market and two stock exchanges (Quito, the capital, and Guayaquil) vying with each other for a limited pool of bond and equity issuances. In this context, financing is (and will remain) dominated by bank loans, with only large companies able to secure the lowest rates of around 7%. Smaller companies face rates of upwards of 12%, with loan maturities often capped at three years. Long-term bank finance and capital market finance remain under-developed and difficult to secure.
State intervention in the banking sector has been a feature of the business environment in recent years, but is unlikely to pose as significant a risk during 2019-23. After years of outright hostility under the Correa government, the approach is more conciliatory under Mr Moreno. This has engendered greater confidence both amongst commercial banks and their customers, with deposit and credit growth both accelerating, albeit from a low base. Profit ratios are relatively low, although steadily rising, and the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio has increased close to the Latin American average. Despite the improving outlook, structural weaknesses continue to affect Ecuador's financing score. Even with a legacy of several banking crises, most recently in 1999, the vast majority of deposits are still held in instant-access accounts, which means that the banks are at risk of a run on deposits.
Intervention in the banking sector will remain a risk, albeit at a lower level
Confidence in the banking system is tied to the management of reserve requirements at the Banco Central del Ecuador (the central bank), which is key to sustaining dollarisation but has been the target of regulatory changes. With the government's dollar liquidity needs likely to remain high in the forecast period, there is a risk of more aggressive control on bank deposits, with potentially damaging effects on lending and market confidence. The government will continue to seek broad stability in the banking sector, reducing the risk of directed lending policies in 2019-23. However, regulatory changes made since 2014 mean that the possibility exists, as the Junta Monetaria (the monetary board) technically retains important discretionary powers. This was most recently demonstrated by a ruling by the board in April 2017 that requests for commercial and personal credit must be guaranteed by assets worth 150% of the value of the loan, which will act as a disincentive to potential borrowers. Although not part of our central forecast given the current government's more market-friendly stance, further changes to the regulatory environment cannot be discounted during 2019-23.
Business environment outlook: The labour market

Despite marginal improvements in the underlying score in 2019-23, the labour market will remain one of the weakest areas of Ecuador's business environment. An increase in spending on education and training programmes during the oil boom years failed to raise skills levels or productivity, with lower oil prices necessitating subsequent cutbacks. Although moves to increase flexibility in labour market regulation under the current government are positive, the need for fiscal adjustment will cap public investment in education, meaning that long-running and structural problems such as skills shortages are unlikely to be tackled. Access to social security has improved for some sectors of the population, but the labour market remains highly informal, which will be difficult to tackle. In comparative terms, labour costs will edge down slightly in 2019-23 but remain high, particularly in relation to productivity.
The government is likely to table a labour market reform bill in the coming weeks. The Ministry of Labour has indicated that it will include three central measures: increasing probation periods for new employees; allowing employees to work their contracted hours over a reduced or increased number of days, including weekends; and eliminating a tax that employers have to pay for temporary contracts (35% of salary levels). Increasing probation periods will give firms greater flexibility, as severance costs once employees are taken on in a permanent position are high. Allowing employees to work flexible hours is designed to encourage more women to join the labour market, while the elimination of the 35% tax on temporary contracts will make it cheaper for firms to hire. Prospects for a successful passage through Congress are relatively positive, although it will take time for the impact to be fully felt. The measures in isolation are unlikely to stimulate large-scale job creation in the formal sector, however, given that the overall investment climate remains weak.
The strength of the US dollar will compound competitiveness problems with other countries in the region in the short term (Ecuador's minimum wage is among the highest in Latin America in dollar terms, although productivity in Ecuador lags behind that of most neighbours). Although we expect some depreciation of the US dollar from 2020, this will be mild and insufficient to boost competitiveness significantly.
Mr Moreno will continue to build on initiatives begun under the Correa administration to improve public education. Initially, the president's focus appeared to be on provision at the tertiary level, with (overly ambitious) pledges to construct 40 new universities. More recently, however, the focus seems to have shifted towards early childcare: as part of the borrowing agreement with the IMF, the government has committed to drawing up an action plan by the end of September 2019 that focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of primary education. The government's commitment is positive, but fiscal constraints will hamper progress. Aside from uncertainty over the source of funding for such investment, long-standing educational challenges will not be addressed. Although net secondary school enrolment rose from 56% in 2007 to 86% in 2017, student results continue to trail those of other countries in the region. Improving results and boosting skills levels will require a sustained and long-term commitment from the government; even assuming improved quality of education policies and increased spending, student results would be unlikely to improve until towards the end of (or beyond) our forecast period.
The official rate of open unemployment averaged 4.1% in 2018. This rate is fairly low, but fails to reflect underemployment (those working on an occasional or part-time basis but looking for full-time employment), which is above 50% of the workforce. The formal sector workforce in stable employment with social security benefits makes up the other 50%.
Business environment outlook: Infrastructure

Infrastructure was one of Ecuador's stronger areas in the business environment rankings in the historical period, owing to major capital spending by the Correa administration. We expect some further improvements in 2019-23, which will lift both the score and rankings. A large public-investment programme previously put in place by Mr Correa means that multiple projects are likely to reach completion during the forecast period, given that financing has already been agreed and in many cases, the projects are under way (some, however, have been cancelled owing to project mismanagement, while others have been subject to large cost overruns). These changes mean that after decades of underinvestment-alongside frequent electricity shortages-the quality of transport, energy and road infrastructure is now comparable to the Latin American median, and telecoms development (measured in mobile and internet penetration) is above the regional average. However, given the need for fiscal consolidation, government efforts to modernise infrastructure will be reined in. The authorities will seek to attract private investment into infrastructure projects, but Ecuador lacks the solid track record of fostering successful public-private partnerships that have helped to upgrade infrastructure in other countries in the region.
Increased investment in hydroelectric generation is expected
A major focus of the government's infrastructure programme has been the development of new hydroelectric power plants to avoid importing costly energy for gas-fired and thermoelectric plants. In the medium term, there is potential not only to close the supply-demand gap but also, potentially, to allow the country to export energy. On the downside, there are some concerns that planned projects will fail to reach expected generation levels, or that government neglect of investment in transmission and distribution facilities will lead to supply bottlenecks.
Recent investment has led to road infrastructure improvements and the creation of new road networks. This is helping to boost domestic and intraregional trade but has also created challenges, including congestion (advances in traffic management have been more limited). Moreover, seasonal heavy rains that are costly and difficult to fully mitigate continue to cause seasonal disruption in some areas. The difficult topography adds an additional obstacle and there are concerns about misuse of funds. There has been much slower progress on developing mass-transport systems to relieve urban congestion, including a much-delayed underground rail system in the capital (Quito Metro) that is now projected to start operations in March-April 2020, and a tram project in Cuenca (Ecuador's third-largest city), which has been delayed but with no projected start-date.

Ecuador's score and ranking for technological readiness in 2019-23 are set to improve. However, its global ranking of 67th is still relatively low, reflecting weakness in areas such as advanced mobile technology (including low levels of smartphone penetration) and a lack of spending on research and innovation, which undermines the overall score. However, Ecuador scores relatively well in areas such as preparedness for e-commerce and cyber-security.
The government has set targets to grow the telecoms and information technology sectors. Internet access through mobile phones will drive wider mobile-phone usage during the outlook period, as handsets and data tariffs become more affordable and mobile phones are increasingly used in place of personal computers (PCs). We expect data services to be the fastest-growing segment of the mobile market. However, coverage remains inadequate and costs are high, limiting access. Efforts to loosen the grip of the two foreign-owned firms on the mobile market may boost competition, but both the investment climate and a complicated regulatory environment for foreign companies will remain impediments. Internet penetration, in particular broadband, has been limited but is expected to grow rapidly over the forecast period as technology becomes more widely available and connectivity improves. In line with this, the number of overall internet subscriptions will continue to grow strongly.
As at December 2017, the country had 70,713 km of fibre-optic transmission infrastructure installed, reaching over half a million homes, with a projected reach of 1.4m homes by 2020. As part of a state initiative to narrow the digital divide, the government has also embarked on an ambitious programme to provide 9,000 urban and rural schools with broadband internet, and to increase the penetration rate among the younger population. Over 7,000 public education institutions are connected to broadband, serving over 2.6m students. Ecuador also had 854 community telecentres (infocentros) in 736 local parishes as at May 2018, serving 7m people. However, 377 parishes continue to lack internet access, according to the Asociación de Empresas de Telecomunicaciones, an Ecuadorian telecoms industry association.
We expect internet access through mobile phones to increase rapidly as it becomes more affordable and poor fixed-line infrastructure encourages greater use of mobile data. PC ownership, which is low by global standards, will continue to grow steadily, by an annual average of 6.4%, well above the GDP growth rate. This will support increased broadband usage and penetration.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Under the auspices of an IMF External Fund Facility agreement, the Lenín Moreno administration will seek to implement structural reforms and undertake a sharp fiscal adjustment to tackle weaknesses underlying the Ecuadorean economy and restore sustainability to public finances. Technical and financial backing totalling US$10.3bn from the IMF and other multilateral institutions will be leveraged to address four priority areas: improving competitiveness, tackling fiscal imbalances, protecting the poor and tackling corruption. The fiscal consolidation process is likely to face public and political pushback, as the government begins to cut spending and raise revenues. Absent widespread support from opposition parties, it is likely that Mr Moreno will bear the political cost of fiscal consolidation.
The country's weak fiscal position precipitated the need for financial assistance and will be the primary economic policy challenge as the government aims to curb the rising public debt (estimated at US$46.2bn-around 42.6% of GDP-at end-2018) and improve access to finance without smothering already-weak economic growth. Structural reforms under the guidance of the IMF will help the government to move towards this goal, while also building upon market-friendly policies approved in August 2018 that include a combination of tax breaks, regulatory improvements and privatisations that aim to boost private investment.
The Moreno administration will have modest success in diversifying the economy away from a dependence on oil exports; a process that will remain a key policy objective. Public investment continues to account for nearly 10% of GDP and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Moreno's administration to bolster private-sector activity through IMF-backed business-friendly policies and complementary reforms, including tax incentives, privatisations, a public-private partnership (PPP) framework and promotion of the mining, telecommunications, electricity and transport-ation sectors.
The unpopularity of austerity measures under the IMF-backed economic programme will augment the risk that Mr Moreno's administration is unable to fully meet quantitative targets agreed with the IMF, posing risks to our forecast. However, the popularity of dollarisation, which bolsters living standards by fostering price stability, means that abandoning it would be politically difficult. Adherence to the IMF programme will reduce the risk of de-dollarisation.

Government expenditure 37.1 35.5 33.7 32.2 32.1 32.1
Budget balance -1.2 -0.4 2.4 1.9 1.4 1.7
As part of its arrangement with the IMF, the government will pursue a front-loaded five-percentage-point of GDP increase in the non-oil primary balance by 2021, an overall non-financial public-sector (NFPS) surplus of 2.9% of GDP by 2021 (from a deficit of 1.2% in 2018), and a public debt/GDP ratio of 40% by 2022. The government plans to reach these targets primarily through expenditure cuts, including reducing fuel subsidies, shrinking the public wage bill and dialling down capital spending. In addition, the government is developing a tax law that targets an increase in tax revenue of between 1.5% and 2% of GDP by 2021. Although we do not envisage the passage of a law that achieves these targets, we expect the government to pass legislation that does boost revenue to a lesser degree.
Our forecast assumes that the government will not fully achieve the quantitative targets set in its economic programme, as we assume that the bold fiscal adjustment plan is subject to implementation risks, given Mr Moreno's weakened political capital and the potential for social unrest. Moreover, in addition to the politically unpalatable nature of the front-loaded adjustment, the measures come amid softer international oil prices and a slowdown of the global economy. These external factors will compound the already difficult test that the government faces in implementing unpopular fiscal measures.
As the government attempts to meet its target of swinging its NFPS fiscal balance from a deficit of 1.2% of GDP in 2018 to a surplus of 2.9% by 2021, we expect expenditure cuts to take effect this year. We forecast that the deficit will narrow to 0.4% of GDP in 2019 before shifting into a surplus of 2.4% in 2020. This will support material improvements in the public debt/GDP ratio, and we expect public sector debt as a percentage of GDP to fall from 46.8% of GDP in 2019 to 41.4% by 2023. Moreover, we do not anticipate that the government will return to tap international capital markets during the duration of the IMF agreement. The sovereign most recently tapped global bond markets in January, prior to the multilateral financing deal, when it issued US$1bn in ten-year bonds at par, at a notably high yield of 10.75%, bringing the total amount of global bond issuance since the country returned to the global capital markets in 2014 to a hefty US$15.8bn. Despite still-high yields and relatively short maturities of recent issuance, we do not expect the government to undertake formal restructuring of its international bonds in the forecast period, owing to the IMF programme.

Ecuador has had a dollarised economy since 2000 and monetary conditions hinge on the foreign-exchange balance and the confidence of domestic lenders, both of which have been historically hindered by erratic policymaking. Foreign reserves cover only around 25% of total demand deposits, but we expect the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the central bank) to make a concerted effort to build up reserves as part of the three-year IMF agreement. Further reforms will be implemented with guidance from the Fund to strengthen the autonomy of the central bank. Although it does not feature as part of our baseline forecast, the threat of de­dollarisation and a weak economy sustain the risk of capital flight, which could push interest rates above our current forecasts.

Ecuador's short-term economic growth prospects are primarily encumbered by the government's front-loaded fiscal adjustment that entails cuts to public spending and investment. We estimate that fiscal tightening will depress private investment and consumption growth, dampening GDP growth, which will slow to 0.2% in 2019, down from 1.4% in 2018. Exports are expected to decline marginally this year amid slowing global trade. Import growth will be minimal as domestic demand wanes. Ongoing spending cuts will continue to weaken consumption growth in 2020, resulting in subdued real GDP growth of 1.1%.
We expect more sustained growth in the second half of the forecast period, with the economy growing by an annual average of 2% in 2021-23. The fruition of structural reforms and recovery of oil exports on the back of higher oil prices will bolster growth, albeit below the annual average of 4.5% seen in the boom years of high oil prices and expansionary fiscal policy in 2011-15. Supply-side reforms will support higher hydrocarbons output, which will continue to dominate the economy. Pro-business tax reforms will yield modest results in terms of diversification efforts, but policies that support export-oriented sectors will primarily facilitate increased investment in mining (notably gold and copper). Manufacturing growth will continue to be positive, aided by a steady inflow in foreign direct investment (FDI), following a period of contraction in 2016-17. Private investment will rise only gradually, limiting the growth of non-oil industries.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Notwithstanding efforts to diversify the economy, the oil sector will remain a critical driver of growth in 2019. We expect Ecuador's oil production to average 541,000 barrels/day (b/d) in 2019-23, remaining below the government's ambitious goal of boosting production to 700,000 b/d by 2021 (the end of the current administration's term). Owing to domestic fiscal needs, the government will endeavour to push production higher, which will occur despite OPEC setting an output ceiling of 508,000 b/d in the first six months of 2019, compared with a maximum quota of 524,000 b/d in 2018. The minister of mining and non-renewable natural resources, Carlos Pérez, has acknowledged that, although the government will continue to target growth in the oil sector, Ecuador continues to have difficulty attracting exploration (partially owing to indigenous anti-oil activism).
Growth in the oil sector will primarily emanate from increased production at the 1.6bn-barrel, heavy crude Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini oil field. However, problems in receiving environmental permits have impeded a faster expansion of production. This has also affected investment in some privately operated fields, which if allowed to proceed would help to lift production. The government has set January 2021 as a target date for the complete merger of the two state-owned oil companies, Petroecuador and Petroamazonas, that is likely to support future production. Petroecuador is currently the downstream company while Petroamazonas is responsible for upstream production. Assets of the former could potentially be under consideration for a concessionary model later in 2019, under which a private firm would administer operations and pass on a portion of net profits to the state.
The Moreno administration's more accommodative stance regarding participation by foreign private energy companies than that of its predecessor will be particularly evident in the mining sector. The sector attracted nearly US$800m in FDI in 2018 and output is poised to expand rapidly once the gold mine Fruta del Norte (projected investment stands at US$467m for the 2019-22 period, although execution of investment plans last year fell short of target), operated by a Canadian firm, Lundin Gold, and the copper mine Mirador, under development by ECSA (owned by the Chinese state company, Tongling Metals), begin production in the second half of this year. In addition, a series of further projects are underway with major mining companies competing for stakes, in contrast with the oil industry, where top-level interest is limited.
Government policy is being geared towards improving conditions for the mining sector. In the first quarter of 2019 the government overturned a 70% "windfall tax" on mining profits and plans on introducing further incentives this year. However, friction between local communities and mining firms is likely to slow investment. Many mineral deposits are located in environmentally sensitive areas, close to communities that have lodged complaints with local courts alleging that mining firms have failed to undergo consultation processes. A lack of cohesion among anti-mining activists and the differences in opinion within Ecuador means imminent cancellation of major mining projects currently under construction and under advanced exploration is unlikely. Our view is that the mining sector will continue to face difficulties that will prevent a more dramatic rise in extractive production.

Real wages 3.2 2.7 0.6 0.7 0.4 0.4
Consumer prices rose by 0.17% month on month in April, bringing the annual rate of inflation to a muted 0.2%. We expect that weak demand-side pressures, in conjunction with softer oil prices, will keep inflation subdued in 2019, reaching 0.5% by year-end. We forecast that inflation will pick up later in the forecast period, to average 2.5% in 2021-23, as imports become more expensive owing to fresh dollar weakness and an increase in commodity prices, raising domestic supply costs and so generating price pressures. Although dollarisation helps to stabilise inflation, the economy will remain vulnerable to spikes in food and energy prices.

Dollarisation maintains high levels of public support and adjustments to fiscal policy will help to rein in imbalances. In the past, expansionary fiscal policies raised concerns that dollarisation might be abandoned, but this risk was mitigated by high oil prices and access to global financing. The government's adherence to more prudential fiscal policies will diminish the risk of de-dollarisation. The real effective exchange rate will remain far stronger than its long-term, pre-dollarisation average, despite low inflation.

Under the assumption that Ecuador will implement a front-loaded fiscal adjustment and pass supply-side reforms that enhance the country's competitiveness, we project that the current-account balance will shift from a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2018 to balance in 2019. Weaker domestic demand will support a contraction of imports that will help to generate a small trade surplus of 0.7% of GDP. We expect that the current account will not return to deficit during the remainder of the forecast period, widening to an average 0.8% of GDP in 2020-23. The services deficit is forecast to remain stable and just below 1% of GDP per year in 2019-23. Large debt-service payments will keep the primary income deficit large in 2019-23 (at roughly 2.5% of GDP per year), while firm inflows of workers' remittances will keep the secondary income surplus large (at 2.3% of GDP per year). Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will register a slight increase in 2019-23, aided by more stable, pro-business economic policy, but will nonetheless remain below 1.5% of GDP annually, focused mainly on oil and mining. Foreign-exchange reserves are volatile, reflecting spikes related to periodic bond issuance and dollar outflows. But under the IMF-backed programme, we expect reserves to rise to around US$12bn by 2023, providing more than three months of import cover. Our external-sector forecasts account for the disbursement of large inflows of IMF and multilateral financing (averaging US$3.4bn in 2019-21 annually).

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Ecuador
Stocks and flows
Ecuador has historically attracted relatively little foreign direct investment (FDI). Annual inflows of FDI averaged US$700m in 1994-2008, driven mainly by the oil sector (which accounted for 80% of total FDI). After peaking at just over US$1bn in 2008 (1.8% of GDP), FDI inflows fell to only US$165m in 2010. They recovered somewhat to US$767m (0.8% of GDP) in 2016, but declined to around US$618m in 2017. However, FDI inflows jumped in 2018 and reached US$1.4bn, up by 127% from 2017. Although this is low by regional standards, it reflects the more conciliatory approach to the private sector of the current president, Lenín Moreno, than his predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17), whose policies led to the deterioration of investor confidence. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that FDI will rise moderately in the short term as the government promotes foreign investment in mining (which received 53% of inflows in 2018), as well as in the retail sector, and will average slightly above 1% of GDP in 2019-23. We estimate the total stock of inward FDI at US$18.7bn at the end of 2018. This is one of the smallest stocks among the major Latin American economies, equalling 17.2% of GDP. Ecuador's stock is also small on a per-head basis, estimated at US$1,098 in 2018.
Origin and distribution
The US, traditionally the main source of FDI inflows into Ecuador, went through a period of disinvestment in the country between 2008 and 2010, largely owing to uncertainty surrounding oil contract renegotiations and the global financial crisis. Investment from the US has since remained moderate, reaching US$61m in 2018, up from US$35m in 2017, but below inflows in in 2016 (US$87m) and 2015 (US$186m). FDI from China tapered off in 2018 and reached US$64m (accounting for 5% of inflows), but has grown since 2011 after Ecuador established closer trade and diplomatic ties. Low oil prices and erratic policymaking are factors that have hindered FDI, but we expect the latter to ebb in its influence on foreign investment. Investment flows in oil, mining and further infrastructure projects (such as a long-discussed US$12bn oil refinery in Manabí province) are likely to pick up as Mr Moreno implements pro-market policies. FDI in these sectors predominates other sectors and the origins of FDI reflect this. Investment from European countries, led by the Netherlands and Spain, rose precipitously in 2018, amounting to around US$186m (12% of inflows in 2018) and US$174m (13%) respectively, compared with much lower amounts in 2017. Ecuador's regional neighbours (especially Chile, Colombia and Peru) contribution to FDI inflows is moderate. Manufacturing attracted around 7% of GDP in 2018 and agri- and aqua-culture accounted for around 4%, considerably behind extractive industries (53% of GDP) and commerce (13%).
Determinants
The introduction of production-sharing contracts in the oil sector in 1993 was the main stimulus to the sharp rise in inward FDI during the mid-1990s. Under the administration of Mr Correa, government intervention in the oil sector and other strategic sectors hampered private investment levels from 2008 onwards. Given the complicated economic environment and the necessity of government austerity, the Correa government began overtures to foreign investors in 2014, including a 2014 amendment to the 2009 Mining Law, which allows for private investment under a service-contract framework, so as to reduce the tax and royalty burden. The government also introduced a framework for public-private partnerships in 2015 for infrastructure development and other industries. However, this has so far failed to prompt stronger interest from foreign investors, who remain concerned by the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, weaker global prices deter interest. Elsewhere, Ecuador's weak institutions, small domestic market and low income levels will continue to deter FDI in most non-extractive sectors. The administration of Mr Moreno, which includes ministers with private-sector experience, has taken a more active role than its predecessor in attracting private foreign investment, particularly in the oil and mining sectors, including by re-introducing production-sharing contracts and eliminating the 70% "windfall tax" over profits in mining.
Impact
The impact of inward FDI on productivity and export competitiveness has been limited, because most investment has been directed towards capital-intensive natural resource sectors, which have weak links to the rest of the economy. However, FDI has helped to boost export earnings in the energy sector. Since 2008, when Mr Correa introduced a constitution that enshrines a greater role for the state in the economy, public investment has risen and FDI has fallen. However, these trends may be reversing slightly: FDI accounted for 5.2% of gross fixed investment in 2018-in excess of the 1% recorded in 2010, although far below a peak of over 14% in 2003.
Potential
FDI opportunities exist in Ecuador's petroleum, mining, manufacturing and services sectors. Unlike under Mr Correa, when foreign oil companies typically faced harsh contract terms, policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficiencies and low levels of labour productivity, Mr Moreno's mandate to boost an ailing economy and enhance the country's competitiveness under the auspices of an IMF deal is likely to raise FDI to slightly closer to potential during the forecast period. Carlos Pérez, the hydrocarbons minister (a private-sector executive with decades of in-country experience) has led a pragmatic approach to attracting private foreign capital and boosting production. Ingrained opposition from powerful domestic interest groups will continue to complicate efforts to open-up investment opportunities in the oil sector. The authorities will focus on attracting investment to develop the mining sector and infrastructure, and mining is expected to pick up moderately, although many foreign operators will remain wary about the fiscal framework, even after reforms to existing legislation. This, coupled with a slowdown in the global economy, will dampen interest in Ecuador.

Population growth is slowing
In 2018 the population reached an estimated 17m, and it is expected to rise by a further 1.2m people by 2023. With a falling birth rate and continued, albeit lower, emigration, population growth is slowing. However, at an annual average rate of 1.3% per year in 2019-23, growth will be high compared with developed-country standards and on a par with neighbours in the Andean region. The rate of urbanisation is relatively high: around 64% of the population lives in urban centres, compared with 55% in 1990, and this percentage is expected to rise to 65% by the end of the forecast period. Almost half of city dwellers reside either in the capital, Quito, or in the largest city and main business centre, Guayaquil. Rapid urbanisation over the past 50 years has increased the level of informality, as the creation of full-time jobs has risen at a much slower pace. The rate of unemployment was 4.6% at end-March 2019, which is low by historical standards (and has remained stable year on year), although underemployment remains high, affecting more than half of the workforce. The labour force is expected to continue to expand more rapidly than the overall population during the forecast period, with around 700,000 new labour market entrants in the 2019-23 forecast period. Despite attempts to liberalise the labour market by the administration of the president, Lenín Moreno, reform will take time. As a result, the formal economy will struggle to absorb the new entrants, particularly as diversification away from the energy-dominant labour market will also be slow (and will primarily focus on mining and agriculture). Consequently, informal employment, estimated at 46% of the labour force as at March 2019, is unlikely to subside significantly.
Although inflows of illegal migrants from Colombia have fallen in recent years, inflows from Venezuela may put renewed pressure on the domestic labour market. By end-2018 Ecuador had received over 200,000 migrants from Venezuela. Inflows of returning Ecuadorean migrants from Spain, where the labour market is still recovering, will also maintain pressure on the local labour market and public services. Meanwhile, outward migrant flows will stabilise, despite a more robust US labour market, as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that Ecuador will maintain modest growth rates in the later half of the forecast period (2021-23).
In 2019-23 Ecuador's crude birth rate is expected to fall to an annual average of 19.4 per 1,000 population (down from 20.9 in 2014-18). The crude death rate will remain steady at an annual average of 5.1 per 1,000 population in 2019-23. The old-age dependency ratio, which will rise slightly to reach 0.13 by 2023, will remain low by developed-country standards. However, given constraints on public spending, an ageing population will place growing pressure on an already heavily indebted social security system. Since 2015, the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (the social security institute) has disinvested an average of US$1.7bn from its retirement fund to pay a portion of pension funds, as personal contributions do not suffice. Although the government plans to reduce its divestments, we expect the state-run social security system to encounter difficulties ending its debt woes.
Education and healthcare standards remain low
Amid fiscal consolidation measures, the Moreno government will continue to commit to spending on education and healthcare, but standards will remain low, following decades of underinvestment. Regular labour conflicts with public healthcare and education workers, often resulting in industrial action, have further damaged the quality of services. There have been improvements in poverty levels and social indicators, in part owing to the previous government's targeted investment of strong oil revenue, but some of these gains have receded because of the 2015-16 recession, which resulted in a spike in underemployment. However, Ecuador remains slightly ahead of its Andean neighbours in average life expectancy. The 2008 constitution promised free universal healthcare and education but, despite increased spending, the government will struggle to achieve these goals during the forecast period. As a result, improvements in the quality of both will be only gradual.

Ecuador is one of the smallest markets included in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings, accounting for roughly 0.1% of global GDP, and a similar share of global exports. However, its oil and mineral reserves will continue to attract interest from foreign investors, although less favourable contract terms and doubts over the business environment, combined with tepid global commodity prices, have put off many private investors, with foreign state-owned companies securing a stronger position.
Market will expand modestly in forecast period
Boosted by a rising population but hindered by only moderate economic growth, Ecuador's market size will expand modestly in 2019-23. Although it has risen in recent years, GDP per head, which is estimated at US$6,370 in 2018 and forecast to reach US$6,951 in 2023, is relatively low, restricting business opportunities. Moreover, Ecuador's per-head income figures will continue to disguise wide inequalities. Despite a rise in consumption in 2018-19, we expect reductions in income inequality will be marginal at best in 2019-23 as unemployment and, in particular, underemployment increase and the government reduces the rate of minimum-wage increases. As the president, Lenín Moreno, pursues fiscal consolidation, we expect that capital expenditure will be cut more than social spending.
The government of Rafael Correa (2007-17) invested the proceeds of the oil price boom in upgrading Ecuador's underdeveloped infrastructure. Although substantial improvements were made, particularly to the road system, significant gaps remain. The Moreno administration is more accommodative to private-sector investors and efforts to improve the legal framework will provide a moderate boost for investment (domestic and foreign), notably in the export-oriented energy and mining sectors, and related services. However, despite a strong natural resource endowment, growth in exports will remain below potential, and Ecuador's share of world exports will stagnate at 0.1%.
As a result of dollarisation and successive years of guaranteeing a "living wage" (essentially a minimum wage), Ecuador is no longer a cheap-labour investment location. In US dollar terms, the country's minimum wage is one of the highest in Latin America. Also reducing the country's competitiveness are low skills levels. However, dollarisation facilitates greater overall macroeconomic stability for businesses to assess investment opportunities, particularly by reducing inflation and exchange-rate risks. Investment in most areas outside the oil sector will be slow to arrive, as Mr Moreno's attempts to improve the business environment will not be immediate and progress on increasing the transparency and efficiency of the judicial system is unhurried.

Business opportunities limited by low level of development
With family units shrinking, the number of households in Ecuador has grown faster than the population over the past decade, although an average of around five people per household is still large by international standards. This long-term trend will offer business opportunities, although it is limited by Ecuador's low level of development. A significant proportion of average income-around 23%-is still spent on food, which is high by both regional and global standards. In addition, price controls on some foodstuffs protect inefficient local producers at the expense of consumers. Pro-market policies are expected under Mr Moreno, but we expect the new government to extend restrictions introduced by Mr Correa in 2015 to protect the balance-of-payments position against weak oil prices. Real incomes will gradually rise, freeing up greater expenditure on transport and communications, leisure and education, and healthcare. Nonetheless, Ecuador's market will remain comparatively small.

Ample scope for catch-up but challenges persist
Ecuador's wealth of natural resources, a young and expanding middle class, and a push to improve educational standards offer scope to catch up with more developed countries over the next four decades. However, a series of challenges need addressing over the short and medium term to build on these positive conditions. Although the investment rate has improved considerably, it remains overly reliant on public-sector spending, which in turn is vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. Private investment is scant and overall savings are low, two factors that are only likely to improve moderately in coming years, holding down productivity growth. Despite a more stable policy framework, Ecuador's institutions are likely to remain weak, and progress in tackling a large informal sector will be limited. Nevertheless, higher spending on health and education should help to improve labour productivity growth in 2031-50. In this context-and barring a sharp and prolonged deterioration in the country's terms of trade or a return to severe political instability-Ecuador should post modest GDP growth in 2019-30 (averaging 1.6%), with levels remaining roughly the same in 2031-50 (1.9%) as the working-age population expands more slowly.
Initial conditions: Rapid urbanisation in the past 30 years and faster integration into the world economy have produced few long-term benefits for the population. Political instability, weak institutions and high levels of poverty and inequality-combined with an economy overly dependent on oil-have yielded a rent-seeking and unproductive economy, plagued by low education levels and productivity, and high labour-informality. The government of Rafael Correa (2007-17) made efforts to address low social indicators and improve infrastructure, but failed to boost private investment and savings. In addition, the previous government harmed the legal framework for investment by constantly changing regulations and putting up hurdles to capital. Although dollarisation has brought macroeconomic stability since 2000, it has also made the country less competitive and accentuated the risks of inadequate fiscal management.
Demographic trends: Population growth is set to fall gradually over the long term, from an average of 1.2% in 2019-30, to 0.8% in 2031-50. The main causal factor will be lower fertility rates, in addition to some net migration. On the upside, The Economist Intelligence Unit projects that the growth of the working-age population will continue to outstrip overall population growth until 2040, providing a major demographic boom and keeping the dependency ratio low. The main challenge facing the country will be to create enough formal jobs for entrants to the labour market, so as to reduce informality. There has been some progress in expanding education across all levels to improve labour quality, but the lack of dynamism in the private sector means that there is a substantial risk of labour informality remaining high in the long term. An additional challenge is to tackle the pension needs of an ageing population, which could increase strains on the country's vulnerable social security system.
External conditions: As a small, open economy, Ecuador has benefited from rising global trade, but also remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. This, in turn, causes significant external and fiscal volatility. The potential for stronger integration with industrialised nations or blocs like the US and EU (traditionally Ecuador's main trade partners) will remain constrained by long geographical distances and the lack of a consistent trade policy. Rising trade integration with neighbouring countries could boost growth, but progress will suffer from sporadic trade spats, lack of supply-chain strategies and infra-structure constraints. Export diversification towards the Middle East, Russia and Asia has seen some success, but Ecuador's small and distant market will drag its competitiveness profile, particularly in relation to other emerging markets in Asia. With the economy likely to remain heavily dependent on hydrocarbons and some mineral and agricultural products, the external sector and GDP growth will be very dependent on the direction of terms of trade.
Future governments will struggle with a weak legal framework
Institutions and policy trends: Ecuador's institutions have long suffered from periods of instability, and despite a growing sense of macroeconomic and political stability in the past couple of years, they remain fundamentally weak. Inconsistent policymaking remains a major problem, both in conceiving and implementing new legislation. Successive administrations have changed policy directions. The government of Lenín Moreno does not enjoy the wide support of workers in all state institutions or a clear majority of the population, both of which allowed Mr Correa to pursue his policy agenda. Instead of strengthening the rule of law and cementing the division of power among the country's institutions, Mr Correa's policies resulted in the concentration of power in the hands of the executive, attacks on press freedom and poor regulatory quality. Mr Moreno faces a fragmented political landscape and public discontent amid anxiety over the future of economic growth and security, which will undermine his efforts to roll back some of his predecessor's excesses and hinder fiscal consolidation. Future governments (regardless of their ideological inclination) will continue to struggle with a weak legal framework, corruption and distorted policy priorities (such as oil subsidies) that either favour special interest groups or act as a major drag on the public finances.
Dollarisation will be protected by its persistent popularity
Dollarisation: A key policy decision will be whether to maintain dollarisation or opt for an independent currency. At present, we expect the current monetary framework to remain in place, as the costs of abandonment, in particular the fear of stoking social unrest, are very high. However, an abandonment of the system cannot be ruled out, especially if the government is faced with a prolonged fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis. Moves-albeit incremental-towards reducing fiscal dependence on oil, narrowing the structural deficit at the central government level and reducing external debt using oil-related windfalls would help to reduce the likelihood of such a crisis occurring. In the short term, commitment to an IMF-backed economic programme will strengthen the foundations of dollarisation. The government will endeavour to build up international reserves throughout the duration of its agreement with the multilateral institution (ending in 2021). This is likely to occur alongside central bank amendments that reinforce a dollarised regime and the bank's independence. The government's IMF-backed economic programme also entails a waning of public debt levels and a move to fiscal surplus. We expect that, although the government will not meet the quantitative targets established with the Fund, the long-term sustainability of dollarisation will be reinforced and the fiscal stance of the country will be more stable.
Long-term performance: Unattractive investment conditions and the lack of a competitive, skilled labour force will make Ecuador a relatively unappealing destination for foreign investment in labour-intensive or manufacturing activities. However, sustained improvements in education levels, topped with productive investment in non-oil sectors and technology transfer, could make Ecuador more competitive and boost long-term growth. For this to occur there is a need to strengthen the country's institutional framework and improve the business environment. Although Mr Moreno's administration is likely to pursue policies that strengthen private-led growth, our forecast suggests that the structural reforms his government will implement will not be deep enough for Ecuador to catch up, income-wise, with OECD countries in the long term.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Prone to earthquakes, the country will continue to suffer from natural disaster risk, but its adaptation and readiness will improve following a particularly devastating earthquake in 2016. Climate change preparedness, however, is more lacking. Ecuador's geographical location and diversity renders it particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Owing to the near constant temperature year-round, a rising temperature has threatened the development of glaciers, which have not been able to replenish lost density during colder seasons. Indeed, Ecuador has experienced a significant reduction in the size of its glaciers in the two main mountain ranges, the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Occidental, which in aggregate have seen a reduction of around one-third over the past 50 years. By 2050 this trajectory will jeopardise the water sources for the country's major urban centres, such as the capital, Quito. Rising temperatures will also negatively affect agricultural production, as warmer winters cause crops to sprout prematurely and greater volatility in precipitation rates will also disrupt production.
Sustainability concerns will take centre stage in the medium to long term. Despite failing on the ambitious goal of reaching 90% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2017 (currently renewable energy accounts for around 60% of electricity generation, with hydroelectric power, at 58%, accounting for almost all), hydroelectric and geothermal power primarily, and wind and solar power secondarily, will play an increasingly important role in the medium to long term. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the government will incrementally roll back its high fuel subsidies to make way for these renewable sources, which will offer increasing business opportunities. However, in the short term the government will continue to promote oil and mining production-particularly in the Yasuní region-which may pose long-term threats to environmental stability.
Migration and urbanisation
Urbanisation in Ecuador is a relatively recent phenomenon, and comparatively low for Latin America. The majority of the population has traditionally lived in rural communities in the mountainous region (sierra). Since crossing the 50% threshold in 1990, the percentage of people living in cities has grown slowly from around 62% in 2006 to 64% in 2016. The establishment of a middle class under a social spending and consumption-driven economic policy in the 2000s (particularly by the administration of Rafael Correa, 2007-17) will sustain a large urban population, while security concerns in the north and environmental degradation in the sierra are likely to accelerate the pace of migration from rural areas to cities in the medium term. The country's infrastructure and natural resources will be strained in the process, necessitating greater investment. There will be opportunities for public-private partnerships for infrastructure investment, but internal migration will also invite limited bouts of social unrest.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Norway--highlights: Political outlook
The September 2017 general election produced a centre-right majority in parliament. The ruling coalition maintains the alliance between the centre-right Conservatives and the far-right Progress Party (FrP), but two centrist parties, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF), joined in January 2018 and January 2019 respectively. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this government to last a full term to 2021, and but does not exclude tensions between the centrist parties and the FrP leading to the coalition's collapse. The current administration will push for a right-wing economic agenda while tightening abortion law, owing to the negotiations that brought the KrF into government. The government will also make further efforts on climate policy as part of the deal to bring the Liberals into government.

Norway's business environment outlook improves slightly over the forecast period (2019-12), as its regional and global rankings rise to 7th and 13th place respectively. A solid macroeconomic outlook and sound financial institutions remain the country's strengths, placing it among the best in the world. Although the relatively fractious nature of the ruling coalition will reduce Norway's political stability, the government's tax reform will greatly improve business operating conditions. On the economic side, Norway's tremendous oil wealth insulates the economy from global shocks, notwithstanding the sharp decline in oil prices in 2014. However, Norway is outperformed in this ranking by other Scandinavian economies (Denmark and Sweden), as it is hindered by high labour costs, excessive state control and a small market size.

In line with a weaker growth outlook in western Europe, Norway's real GDP growth is expected to decelerate to an average of 1.9% over the forecast period. The economy has recently recovered from the steep decline in global oil prices in 2014, led by painful adjustments in the oil and gas sector. Now that oil prices have revived, the outlook for future growth, driven by strong investment in the oil sector, is positive. The mainland economy (excluding the oil sector) is also strengthening, owing to resilient household spending. Macroeconomic conditions will be tied to the global energy market, and the government will continue its efforts towards diversifying the economy. The fiscal and current-account surpluses will remain substantial, albeit lower than historical levels.

The demographic outlook is worsening as early waves of migration, firstly from eastern Europe and then later from outside Europe, have receded. Like most developed economies, the proportion of the population aged over 67 is expected to rise (to 18.3% of the total in 2023)-albeit not to the same extent as in other Nordic countries. The share of the working-age population will be 64% in 2023-higher than that of peer economies. We judge that migration from within the European Economic Area (EEA), typically from eastern Europe, will continue, and that improving living standards will raise the birth rate slightly, keeping annual population growth steady at 0.9% over the forecast period. Non-European migration will continue to be a contentious issue, with restrictions championed by the far-right party, the FrP, but we expect no further tightening of immigration law.

Market opportunities are constrained by the small size of the population (5.3m in 2018). However, Norwegian households are among the wealthiest in the world, with GDP per head of US$63,873 in 2018 measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. At market exchange rates, GDP per head in US dollar terms has fallen sharply, to US$81,911 in 2018, from about US$100,000 in 2011-14. We expect GDP per head at market exchange rates to rise to US$97,791 by 2023.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
As there is little room to raise labour market participation further, Norway's long-term outlook will depend on productivity growth and investment, both of which we expect to rise steadily over the forecast period. The government must also reckon with the economic and financial effects of dwindling oil reserves, forcing further reform of the labour market and pensions system, although the vast Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) provides a near-term buffer.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously in 1935-65 and largely dominated politics until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party (Sp)-the first majority government for two decades. This coalition lasted until 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. The centre right was re-elected in 2017. The Conservatives and the FrP were joined by the Liberals in January 2018 and by the KrF in January 2019.
Political structure: A general election is held every four years and there is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system where 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The centre-right government will try to implement additional business-friendly policies and tax cuts. Near-term efforts will be focused on further reducing the negative spillover effects of the lower oil price on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund is expected to rise, but it will remain comfortably within the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tensions will persist in the Storting over the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: At the start of 2016 most parties agreed on a multi-year corporation tax reduction (from 27% to 23% by 2018) to improve competitiveness in the economy. The government has further reduced this to 22% for 2019. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration of oil and gas. The capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of total goods export revenue. In 2016 the trade account registered its lowest level since 1999, but has been recovering since. The current-account surplus increased to US$35.2bn in 2018, up from US$22.4bn in the previous year. The trade and current-account balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period (2019-23).

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Norway is a parliamentary democracy. The constitution, the second-oldest in the world after the US, provides for a single legislative chamber (Storting, or parliament) of 169 members, with elections every four years. The multi-party coalition government is well established, leading to some risk of government collapse during the parliamentary term. However, parliament does not have the right to call an early election, ensuring that political instability never results in a change of parliamentary arithmetic. This has resulted in a collaborative form of government that is remarkably stable compared with other developed countries. The Storting uses a committee system for passing legislation, with an emphasis on building cross-party consensus, with only the most contentious policies leading to a parliamentary vote. Extensive powers are also devolved to the 18 counties and 422 municipalities, although a recent "municipal reform" seeks to reduce their number. A centre-right bloc, consisting of four parties-the Conservatives, the Progress Party (FrP), the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-has been in government since the 2017 election. However, tensions between the far-right FrP and the centrist Liberals and the KrF cause some risk of a government collapse.

Political outlook: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current centre-right coalition government to last a full term to 2021. The four-way coalition consists of the FrP, the Conservatives, the Liberals and the KrF, and has 87 members of parliament (MPs) in the 169 seat Storting. Risks to the outlook are high, emanating especially from the tension between the right-wing and centre parties of the coalition. The FrP, on the right of the bloc, is becoming increasingly combative within the government as it fights declining popular support and seeks to exert more influence on policymaking. The KrF, a centrist party, will seek to moderate the FrP's pugilistic messaging on migration and social policy. The coalition will depend on the willingness of the centrist KrF and the Liberals to tolerate a more provocative FrP in government.
Following the September 2017 parliamentary election the right-wing "bourgeois" parties formed the first majority government not to have any support from left-wing parties since the 1980s. A centre-right majority government was a long-held ambition of Erna Solberg, the prime minister and leader of the Conservatives. The coalition maintains the alliance between the Conservatives and the FrP from the previous minority government of 2013, but it expanded to include the Liberals in January 2018 (in exchange for concessions on environmental policy) and the KrF a year later.
Negotiations to admit the KrF into the coalition culminated in a 108-page agreement announced by all four parties on January 17th 2019; since the 2017 election the KrF had only supported the government in parliament, but had not joined a coalition. The agreement plans to tighten abortion law (a concession to the KrF) and has a strong emphasis on environmental protection. It also outlines tax cuts, reduced road-toll fees and rises in child benefits. However, the KrF's more controversial call to end the right to late-term abortion in cases in which the foetus presents a type of disability was rejected by the other parties. Kjell Ingolf Ropstad, who led the KrF's coalition negotiations, took over as party leader in April 2019.
Before Mr Ropstad, the KrF was led by Knut Arild Hareide, who pursued a more hostile strategy with the other right-wing parties, twice threatening to bring down the government. Firstly, in March 2018 the KrF threatened to side with the centre-left opposition in a no-confidence vote if Sylvi Listhaug, a member of the anti-migrant FrP and at that time minister of migration and integration, did not resign over a statement on social media that said the opposition Labour Party "cares more about the rights of terrorists than national security". Then, in September 2018 Mr Hareide announced his wish to break from the right-wing bloc and move the party to the left, eventually joining a Labour Party-led centrist administration. The attempt failed when a majority of delegates rejected this and voted to join the centre-right government in early November, paving the way for the elevation of Mr Ropstad to party leader.
Since Ms Listhaug returned to government as public health minister in May 2019, risks of conflict between the coalition's right-wing and centrist parties have risen. Nevertheless, we expect the coalition to last until 2021, as the parties have an extensive policy platform to implement and Ms Solberg is committed to ensuring the coalition's survival. Risks to this forecast stem from the diverging strategies of the KrF and the FrP, which could induce either party to bring down the government.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Norway will retain its high score for government effectiveness, and the country's apparatus to design and implement policy will remain one of its strengths. The government, on both the political and administrative side, remains largely free of corruption. However, the consensus-driven nature of Norwegian politics curtails the extent of liberal, pro-business reform, and the overweening extent of bureaucracy can stifle government effectiveness.
As European integration has proceeded since 2007, the Storting has taken a more strident role in scrutinising European rules transposed into law as part of Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). As negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU proceed, there is some clamour within the FrP for a more distant relationship with Europe, but despite the FrP's inclusion within the government, we view a substantial revision of Norway's relationship with the EU, either for or against future integration, as unlikely.
Although policymaking is centred in Norway's capital, Oslo, implementation is largely left to regional authorities, which decentralises the government's functions. The system works well, with sub-national government comprised of municipalities and counties that have equal rights and responsibilities, regardless of their size. Functions are divided between these regional branches. Municipal government supervises junior education, health and social care, and town planning and infrastructure. County government oversees development and planning region-wide, including roads, public transport and senior education.
Substantial reform of local government is under way
A substantial reform of local government was launched in 2014 by the Conservative-led minority government. Known as "municipal reform" (kommunesammenslaing), it plans to merge Norway's 428 municipalities into 354 and halve the country's 18 counties, with the intention of reducing the cost and improving the quality of local government services by allowing local government to exploit economies of scale. However, political opposition to the reform has been mounting since 2017, when the government received parliamentary approval to reduce the number of counties. The agrarian-focused Centre Party (Sp) has been climbing steadily in the polls, campaigning against municipal reform, eroding the coalition's popularity. Despite these difficulties, we expect steady consolidation to continue in the coming years, supported by a broad consensus in parliament.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next local elections will be held on September 9th 2019. The Storting cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that the next general election will be in 2021.
Political outlook: International relations
Diplomatically, Norway has been largely untouched by the souring of US-European relations since the election of Donald Trump as US president. This is due to Norway's position within NATO as one of the alliance's most important members and Norway's high bilateral trade surplus with the US, which stood at about US$476m in 2017. In a visit to the US in January 2018 Ms Solberg announced the purchase of F-35 fighter jets and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from US suppliers, supporting stronger trade and military relations with the country.
Relations with the EU will remain one of the main foreign policy issues, particularly in the light of the UK's vote to leave the bloc. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (for a fee), but must accept most EU regulations without having any influence over them. The economic consequences of Mr Trump's protectionist stance remains a risk for Norway's exports to the EU, as US tariffs would dampen Norway's external demand.
Following the EU and the US, Norway imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the conflict in Ukraine and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014; these are likely to remain in place in the medium term.

Norway's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises solidly, from 8.01 in the historical period (2014-18) to 8.28 in the forecast period (2019-23), underpinned by a significant strengthening of underlying macroeconomic and financing conditions, as well as an improved tax environment. However, the improvement in the country's business environment lifts it by only one position in our regional and global rankings, to seventh and 13th respectively. This leaves Norway's business environment behind those of its Nordic neighbours. In the regional ranking, Denmark, Sweden and Finland are all in stronger positions than Norway.
In the forecast period there will be significant increases in the scores for macroeconomic environment, taxes and financing. There will be modest improvements in Norway's market opportunities, infrastructure and technological readiness categories. A primary source of weakness is political stability, reflecting the fractious nature of Norway's current government and tensions within the ruling coalition, which we expect to continue over the forecast period. Moreover, as the the economy approaches full capacity, there will also be a decline in labour market scores, due to higher labour costs.
Norway will remain one of the world's best locations for businesses
Although difficulties related to political turbulence and labour costs persist, Norway will remain among the world's top business locations, owing to a strong record of pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, a modest regulatory burden and excellent transport, energy and digital infrastructure. Weaker aspects include the country's high personal tax burden (albeit supporting high-quality public services and social welfare), limited market opportunities, labour market rigidities and skills shortages. Moreover, the erosion of political stability poses the risk of a gradual dilution of government effectiveness.

Business environment outlook: Norway's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA) maintains investigative vigilance to ensure effective merger control. Greater interaction with the public improves agency effectiveness and investigative abilities.
2021-23: A strategic plan guides the NCA to improve competition in numerous sectors and in procurement.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An investment screening regime that can block foreign investment on the grounds of national security or financial stability comes into effect, to be applied to both EU and non-EU investments.
2021-23: The government takes further efforts to diversify the investor countries beyond fellow European economies such as Sweden and the Netherlands, although to limited effect.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Progress is made on a US-EU trade agreement. The risk that the US administration breaks off negotiations, however, is substantial. Focus on Brexit talks and the implications for Norwegian trade.
2021-23: No change in policy towards joining the EU or leaving the European Economic Area (EEA). A reassessment of EEA membership is possible, but unlikely. Efforts to promote bilateral trade deals continue.
Taxes
2019-20: The government looks into reducing income tax and value-added tax (VAT).
2021-23: The government investigates reform of the subsidy regime for oil and gas exploration. Expansion of environmental taxes to meet climate-change goals.
Financing
2019-20: Norges Bank (the central bank) tightens monetary policy against rising inflation and high household debt.
2021-23: Greater restrictions on financial leverage are implemented. In the wake of the Swedbank scandal, greater emphasis is placed on oversight of financial institutions. Foreign-exchange conditions remain benign.
The labour market
2019-20: Reforms introduced to increase workforce supply. Working Environment Act, tackling flexible contracts, is maintained.
2021-23: Wage bargaining is dominated by demands for catch-up wages. Skills shortages remain an issue.
Infrastructure
2019-20: The government applies the 12-year transport plan (2018-29) and raises the funds available for maintenance and construction of infrastructure projects. A decision on the provider of the fifth-generation (5G) rollout is made.
2021-23: Investments in new road and rail transport links are made, with upgrades to transport infrastructure. Digital infrastructure upgrades continue.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Implementation of Norway's cyber-defence strategy, after cyber-attacks on national infrastructure.
2021-23: The Open Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab grows in size and importance, underpinning AI preparedness.

Rising oil prices have generated an improvement in macroeconomic conditions, reflected in the labour market, the public finances and capital spending. Underlying conditions point to a broadly stable economic outlook, with solid public finances (supported by the Government Pension Fund Global, or GPFG, the vast sovereign wealth fund), a large current-account surplus, substantial corporate and household savings, and reduced imbalances (the housing market is a cause for concern for policymakers). Fiscally, the GPFG, supported by government restraint, should maintain the resilience of the public finances. Norges Bank (the central bank), which manages the fund, will continue a free-floating currency regime and a transparent monetary policy. Monetary policy tightening, compounded by high household indebtedness, may constrain growth. Interest rates are expected to rise steadily to curtail inflation, which is slightly above target. However, policy tightening will be limited by a desire to avoid a sharp appreciation in the krone. Variations in oil prices will remain a source of instability in the current account, although it is probable that government stimulus, similar to that used after the 2014 oil price slump, will be used to mitigate damage to the wider economy. Rising protectionism and the need for economic diversification away from oil represent the largest risks to near- and long-term prosperity respectively.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

Norway's ranking points to a continuation of the country's rigorous approach to competition policy, albeit with further improvement restrained by the still significant degree of state influence in the economy. Norwegian governments of all persuasions tend to be strongly committed to competition, legislating in line with EU law as required by the country's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). The current centre-right government will continue its efforts to defend private-enterprise culture; however, major privatisation attempts will be suspended. The power to investigate competition and enforce competition law will remain vested in the Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA). The NCA is well staffed (with more than 100 employees, mostly economists and lawyers), making it effective in merger control, the policing of cartels and abuse of market dominance, as well as in the investigation of the impact of government policy on competition. The NCA raids office premises when necessary, and has stepped up its merger control by banning three prospective mergers in 2016. The NCA has taken action against bid rigging, imposed large fines for collusion in the publishing industry and fined Telenor, Norway's largest telecommunications provider, for the abuse of its dominant position. The authority works closely with European regulators on crossborder mergers, and the newly established Competition Appeals Committee will improve the process of legal redress for companies contesting decisions. A revision to the Competition Act, passed in 2016, harmonises merger control with EU law and allows for Norwegian settlements in cartel cases.
Limited privatisation plans are set to be carried out
The centre-right government will prioritise its plans for a slight unwinding of state-owned assets, after mixed results previously. The Conservatives' attempt to partially privatise Statkraft, a renewable-energy company, was criticised by the opposition. The government did sell the state's remaining stake in Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), the flag carrier of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but this move should not be seen as a privatisation drive by the government. The state retains significant holdings in crucial sectors, including Equinor (formerly Statoil, 67%), a petroleum company; Telenor (54.5%); Yara (36.2%), a fertiliser manufacturer; Norsk Hydro (40.8%), an aluminium producer; and DNB bank (34%). Statkraft, a renewable-energy company, and Statskog, a forestry and land-management company, remain fully public.
A campaign started in November 2018 by the NCA enables members of the public to report suspected anti-competitive practices directly, and removes any further fees for reporting activity. This was followed up by a series of lectures informing the public on illegal co-operation, and we expect this project to continue throughout 2019. The campaign led to an annual rise of 47% in reports of anti-competitive practices in 2019, according to the NCA, which may be followed up by further legal action. Although this policy will raise monitoring of anti-competitive practices, further investments in regulatory authorities will probably be needed to enforce them.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards foreign investment

The ranking shows a slight improvement in Norway's regional ranking for foreign investment, although this is mostly driven by a protectionist turn among other European economies. Norway has long had a co-operative stance towards foreign investors, abiding by its obligations as an EEA member, and broadly welcoming foreign capital and know-how. Political resistance to foreign influence is limited only to takeovers in strategic sectors and some national cultural institutions. The long-term depletion of offshore hydrocarbon reserves and the pressing issues caused by the oil price crash in 2014 have given impetus to government efforts to pursue foreign investment to diversify the economy and complement the crucial offshore energy sector with new sources of wealth. The government is concentrating on attracting investment from China, principally in the seafood industry. However, diversification efforts have not been as fruitful as expected, leaving the oil and gas sector as the most important for foreign investors for the foreseeable future.
National security will play a larger role in foreign investment decisions
In line with developments across developed economies, concerns around national security are likely to play a larger role in decisions on foreign investment over the forecast period. An expanded national security law took effect in January 2019, which gives the government power to stop any foreign acquisitions of crucial sectors that may threaten national security. Companies wishing to acquire a third of any business of vital security interest will be required to notify the relevant ministry. This is in line with an increasingly general trend of political interference in business acquisitions. The new law is likely to lead to an increase in workload for the affected Norwegian businesses in terms of notifications, assessments and dialogue with the authorities. It could also impair the competitiveness of, and reduce the investment risk appetite for, Norwegian companies that will be subject to the new regime. Although the law has yet to be invoked in a foreign takeover, its application highlights a tightening of Norwegian policy towards national security threats.
Policy will attempt to diversify Norway's inward foreign direct investment (FDI). Although Swedish investors have historically dominated external investment, the US plays a reportedly underestimated role. The authorities will seek investment from elsewhere in Europe, and increasingly from China and the rest of Asia. Invest in Norway is a governmental investment promotion agency established in 2013 that focuses on attracting external investment. The agency will prioritise investments from non-traditional markets, but also within industries, such as maritime, fishing, renewable energy and biotech, that have been highlighted as means to diversify Norway's economy away from oil and gas.
Norwegian state railway's privatisation of certain routes will continue. In October 2017 a British public transport provider, Go-Ahead, won the first Norwegian railway tender for operation of a rail service. The service, covering the Sorlandet line to Stavanger, Arendal line services and Jaer line local services from Stavanger totalling 5.5m train-km/year, will be run over ten years. We expect a gradual widening of public-private collaboration in Norwegian infrastructure, including rail infrastructure, in accordance with the 12-year transport plan (2018-29).
The generous tax structure for oil investment will continue
Support for foreign investment on the Norwegian continental shelf is likely to remain generous. Investors will continue to be offered new blocks to explore for oil and gas, based on ordinary concession licensing rounds held every two years in frontier areas. In June 2018 the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy offered 12 new production licences to 11 companies in the 24th licensing round. The number of applicant companies fell to 11, from 26 in the previous round, which created some concern regarding interest in the Norwegian shelf. Nine of the licences are focused on the Barents Sea and three in the Norwegian Sea. No licences for frontier areas will be available in 2019. A coalition agreement that enforces a ban on exploring for oil off the Lofoten, Senja and Vesteralen islands, introduced by the centrist Liberal Party, will continue to be upheld through the parliament's term to 2021.

As Norway is a net energy exporter, with a small domestic market and limited manufacturing capabilities, Norwegian governments of all persuasions adopt broadly pro-free-trade policies, despite the long-standing reluctance to join the EU and the protectionism afforded to home-produced agriculture. The deterioration in Norway's regional and global rankings in our assessment here largely reflects the improved performance of neighbouring countries and the lack of improvement in Norway's trade openness due to the country's remote location and undiversified export base. Trade openness notwithstanding, Norway's institutions remain largely welcoming to trade. Except in extremis, foreign investors in Norway are guaranteed the absence of foreign-exchange controls, with an independent central bank overseeing a free-floating krone. Profits and dividends earned in all areas of the economy, including oil and gas, may be repatriated without obstruction, with no restrictions on capital inflows or outflows. Through Norway's membership of the EEA, Norwegian and foreign-owned companies in Norway gain full access to the single market. EU access guarantees the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between Norway and EU member states. Norway adopts around three-quarters of all single-market legislation, with the notable exceptions being laws that govern agriculture and fisheries. Norway will continue to work in favour of free trade, harmonising its duties and tariffs structure in line with World Trade Organisation (WTO) and EU agreements, and giving high priority to making new EEA rules applicable in Norway. This will allow it to maintain its excellent record of transposing EU rules into national law. Free trade outside the EU will be promoted mainly through the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA) by negotiating free-trade agreements (FTAs). There are currently 27 FTAs covering 38 countries. Norway has preferential trade arrangements with a growing number of countries outside the EU and has revived trade talks with China concerning energy sector co-operation and opening up the Chinese market for farmed salmon as relations have thawed since 2017. Norway has followed the EU's lead in placing sanctions on Russia since mid-2014, resulting in a Russian ban on EU (including Norwegian) food imports and other items.
Renegotiation of Norway's EEA membership is unlikely
Norway's position on the fringe of European institutions is unlikely to change. It is not a member of the EU and will not consider joining over the forecast period, as an increasing number of parties oppose membership. In addition to the well-known position of the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party (Sp), the Progress Party (FrP) also made public its opposition to EU membership in 2016. Given insufficient political and public support, the Conservatives have set aside plans for another referendum on membership (the last one was held in 1994, when membership was rejected). There is a growing movement within the FrP, led by the party's deputy leader, Sylvi Listhaug, to renegotiate the terms of Norway's EEA membership, although centrist parties within the ruling coalition and the example of Brexit make the prospect of wider renegotiation unlikely.
US-EU trade relations will depend on the Boeing-Airbus dispute
Since the election of Donald Trump as US president trade relations between the EU and the US have become more fraught. The US administration's efforts have largely been focused on China, but tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminium in March 2018, and EU retaliation followed. More recently, concerns have centred around automotive trade, with the US considering raising tariffs on about EUR47bn (US$53bn) of European auto exports. Our core forecast is that this threatened tariff rise will not happen, given the lenient schedule of negotiations (which are to last until November 2019) and the upcoming 2020 US election campaign. However, should current discussions over the Boeing-Airbus dispute turn sour, this could spark a wider trade conflict involving other sectors, including the automobile sector.
Lobbying will intensify from businesses in northern Norway to withdraw from the EU's trade embargo on Russia, but Norway will remain party to the embargo as long as the EU's relations with Russia remain tense; retaliatory measures by Russia will continue to deprive Norwegian-based firms in the fisheries sector of an important market.
Steady trade integration with other trading powers is likely to continue, with the EU-Japan trade agreement coming into force in February 2019. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) will gradually be enforced in 2018-22. Both deals eliminate most trade tariffs, ease border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation. In both cases the immediate benefits of trade integration will be limited owing to an extensive transition phase, but the wider benefits to productivity, growth and employment are likely to be felt in the coming years.

The ruling coalition, led by the right-wing FrP and the centre-right Conservatives, has prioritised reform of the tax system. Norway's tax system scores relatively poorly compared with other components of the business environment, but the government's plans for tax reductions have raised the country's relative ranking substantially over the forecast period, to fifth in Europe. The reform measures seek to make the system more growth-oriented, making tax rates more competitive and tranferring the burden from direct to indirect taxation. The government is continuing its programme of steady reductions in the corporate tax rate, reducing the headline rate from 27% in 2014 to 25% in 2016 and 22% in 2019 This has brought Norway's effective tax rates closer to its regional peers (both Denmark and Sweden have 22% corporate tax rates) and in line with the OECD average. Offshore petroleum companies pay a higher rate on income, which has risen steadily, from 53% in 2016 to 56% in 2019, but effective tax rates remain largely unchanged, as the lower rate of investment-based depreciation, the "rate of uplift", has been reduced from 5.5% in 2016 to 5.2% in 2019. Taxation on hydropower production has also risen steadily, from 33% in 2016 to 34.3% in 2017 and 37% in 2019. Although the government is not likely to raise taxes further on hydrocarbon extraction, future governments may decide to review the generous conditions for oil exploration investment, as the right-wing FrP is gradually losing support from its 2010 peak. Currently the government covers 78% of the costs of searching for oil reserves if the company conducting the discovery does not make a profit.
Personal rates of income tax will probably fall over the forecast period
Personal rates of income tax are likely to fall steadily throughout the government's term. The 2019 budget cut personal income tax rates to 22%. Since 2016 the bracket tax is applied to four income brackets, which have been gradually adjusted over time; as at January 2019 the bracket taxes stood at: 1.9% on incomes between Nkr174,500 (US$21,087) and Nkr245,650, 4.2% on incomes between Nkr245,650 and Nkr617,500, 13.2% on incomes between Nkr617,500 and Nkr964,800, and 16.2% on incomes above this threshold. This replaced the surtax system (an additional tax that applied only to the two highest income brackets). A financial activities tax also came into force in 2017.
Under the Conservative-led coalition government there is likely to be further downward pressure on the tax burden. In the election campaign Erna Solberg, the prime minister, stated that she would pursue a more moderate reduction than the one implemented in 2013-17, worth Nkr22.4bn (US$2.4bn). Although a "wealth tax" is a long-term goal of the Conservatives, the party has already said that it will not seek to introduce it over the next parliamentary term.
The SkatteFUNN scheme acts as the framework for Norway's support for business innovation and targets enterprises that are at their early stage of development. It is a tax-deduction scheme for companies that are engaged in research and development activities. This fiscal framework is qualification-based and regulated in the statutory framework, and is open to all branches of industry and all types of companies, regardless of size.

Financial stability is guaranteed by well-supervised and funded banks
Norway has improved its position at the top of the regional and global rankings over the forecast period, reflecting the continuous improvement of the its financial regulatory framework. Distortions to the financial system are limited, as banks continue to be well supervised and in most cases exceed their requirements for for Tier-1 capital-adequacy ratios under Basel III. This helps to contain the risks stemming from commercial banks' exposure to the mortgage market and high household debt levels. Although financial institutions in Sweden and Denmark were faced with a money-laundering scandal earlier in 2019, stemming from operations in Baltic states (chiefly Latvia and Estonia), we do not expect similar problems to directly affect the financing abilities of Norwegian banks, as they have experienced strong underlying profit growth domestically, excluding their Baltic operations. The banking system has remained in a healthy state since the global financial crisis. This is because of lower risk exposures and only limited holdings of high-risk European government securities. Shared counterparty and foreign-exchange exposure risks are low, although Norway's banks may be vulnerable because of their exposure to oil and gas, property, and shipbuilding loan portfolios. Foreign companies have access to the same capital sources as domestic companies, but often work through foreign banks, which tend to have offices in Oslo, the capital, and in cities where the oil industry is based, especially Bergen and Stavanger. Access to investment finance is adequate, as tighter rules were established in the wake of the global financial crisis. Companies are able to obtain bank funding (subject to risk limits) and can also access the equity or bond markets, which-owing to the government's strong fiscal position-are more stable than in other countries. Foreign-exchange access will remain unhindered as the authorities maintain a free-float currency outside the euro zone, with no capital controls.
A tightening in mortgage lending rules has curbed household indebtedness
Bank lending will remain the primary source of credit for commercial enterprises. The tightening of regulation on lending, especially household lending, has succeeded in restraining household debt as a share of GDP. With the housing makret cooling, we do not expect further tightening of fianancing regulation. New measures were introduced in 2017, such as an interest-rate stress test (a sensitivity test) when assessing the borrower's repayment capacity, a cap on the loan/value ratio (at 85% for new homes and 60% for second homes) and a loan/income requirement. The countercyclical capital buffer requirement increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2018, to 2%. Equity capital requirements and fees for commercial borrowers will rise proportionately, mitigated by healthy competition in the market for company loans.
Bank financing of existing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and new start-ups will remain restricted. However, low-cost financing will continue to be available from other sources, including the debt and equity markets, non-resident banks and, increasingly, venture capital (which may be government sponsored) to facilitate the development of high-tech, niche sectors.
Borrowing rates will remain low but will rise steadily throughout our forecast period. Regulation of the financial sector will be continually improved, which may affect the ability to lend, but non-resident access to the financial system is assured for well-known corporations and for those with viable business plans and/or a solid track record.

Strong price growth since 2018 has raised pressures on labour costs
High standards of tertiary education and vocational training have helped to develop a highly skilled labour force in managerial expertise and language skills. Central-level bargaining between the government, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions involves a high degree of co-ordination, with blue-collar manufacturing wages providing the benchmark for sector-specific and company-level bargaining. However, we expect the restrictive elements of this system, such as a large public sector and some scarcity of skills in the private sector, to become more prevalent as unemployment edges lower, weakening the country's ranking from 25th to 34th globally. The lack of labour mobility will restrict opportunities for economic development in remote regions, and a mismatch of education and skills among immigrants and asylum-seekers settling in Norway will hamper integration into the workforce. Political pressure to restrict migration will also remain high, stifling any surge in labour supply. High aspirations for wages and entitlements contribute to workforce welfare, but also add to business operating costs. This has become more acute since mid-2018, when rapid price growth put pressure on firms to maintain rising real wages. Strike action is a familiar feature of the main and intermediate settlement process in the public sector and among offshore petroleum industry workers seeking higher rates and benefits, which contributes to the lower score on this category. However, the government reserves the right to enforce arbitration in disputes that are likely to have a major impact on the economy or be detrimental to public health. Although industrial action has taken place recently, notably in the case of SAS employees, we expect future action to be largely avoided through arbitration.
Stricter immigration control, a tightening labour market and divergent sectoral trends will contribute to the mismatch of demand and supply of crucial skills, especially in the healthcare, engineering and construction sectors. The government is likely to take additional measures to close this gap.
Norwegian wages are becoming unmoored from productivity
High labour costs will continue to impede business operations. The importance of the oil sector has encouraged a "Dutch disease" phenomenon where wage growth is increasingly out of step with productivity in important sectors, especially in manufacturing. According to the OECD, Norway's manufacturing productivity has risen by about 50% since 1995, while compensation has risen by just over 250%. In Germany, by contrast, wages and productivity have risen in step, whereas in the wider Nordic economies productivity has outpaced wages. The resurgence of the oil sector since 2016 is likely to exacerbate this phenomenon, making the economy less competitive internationally, raising costs for domestic firms and hampering the government's objective for sustained diversification away from oil.

Norway's physical transport and digital infrastructure networks are adequate for a well-equipped, modern and advanced industrialised nation, with few of the problems, such as traffic congestion, that affect countries with higher population densities. Further investment according to a national infrastructure plan, released in 2018, will raise its regional ranking from eighth to fifth over the forecast period. Good ferry and internal air transport services, including oil-rig helicopter links, help to prevent Norway's diverse topography and weather-related vulnerabilities from creating logistical problems. Rock fall, flooding and landslide risks, alongside the ongoing requirement to increase the connectivity of cities and regions, place constant demands on the public purse to maintain roads, bridges and tunnels, and rail, air and maritime transport systems, as well as public transport links. However, the unpopularity of road tolls, which are an important source of funding for Norwegian infrastructure, are becoming a more salient political issue. Norway's digital infrastructure is among the most highly advanced in the world. In recent years many rapidly expanding start-ups have emerged, enhancing household and business online usage, with almost all basic services available digitally in the present day. Telecommunications coverage and quality is high. Providers are quick to roll out improvements to the high-speed broadband network. However, there are concerns about security, cost and international relations surrounding the upgrading of the country's network to fifth-generation (5G) in the near future.
A National Transport Plan, published in 2018, directs infrastructure spending
Infrastructure policy has been set out by a National Transport Plan for 2018-29, which focuses on maintenance of transport infrastructure, pollution reduction and stronger public-private co-operation, as well as the increasing use of intelligent transport systems. The plan's baseline scenario allocates 58% of the total budget of Nkr418.5m (US$45.6m) for road improvements; 32% for railways (which includes new double-track lines for intercity routes, Oslo-Skien and Halden-Lillehammer, and a second light-rail line in Bergen, to Fyllingsdalen, a borough in the south of the city); and another 3% to sea infrastructure that will benefit the fishing and shipping industries.
The government is expected to make a decision on rolling out Norway's 5G network by the end of 2019, similar to its European neighbours. The cabinet will have to balance concerns around the new network's security against cost and Norway's relations with its neighbours and its 5G providers.

Norway performs well on the technological readiness ranking, although the expected improvements over the forecast period are inadequate to improve its international ranking. The strong result reflects the high quality of e-commerce business and scope of e-government services, widespread internet usage, and a high number of patent registrations. Norway's score for cyber-security preparedness, research and development (R&D) spending, and quality of research infrastructure are weaker, but still high by regional comparison. Total investment in R&D was 2.1% of GDP in 2017-slightly below the OECD average of 2.4% and well below its Nordic neighbours' (3.1% for Denmark and 3.2% for Sweden). In the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018 the country scores particularly well for lifelong learning (aided by Norway's flexible education system) and the government's openness to innovation. Weaker aspects include low levels of patent application and intellectual property assets in the country.
A cyber-attack on an energy supplier led to a national plan for cyber-security
In May 2019, in response to the increasing prevalence of cyber-security attacks (exemplified by an attack on Norsk Hydro, a state-backed energy supplier, in March 2019), the government unveiled a national cyber-security strategy. This strategy places further emphasis on public-private collaboration across both civilian and military branches of government, with the aim of safeguarding national infrastructure against cyber-security threats.
Public-private partnership will be an increasing theme in technology research initiatives, in line with many other developed economies. In August 2018 some of Norway's biggest companies announced that they would jointly establish a national powerhouse for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the country's quality and capacity for research, education and innovation in the field. The government has actively supported these partnerships, as it encourages the matching of technical skills to business need, reducing the extent of skills mismatches and raising productivity. However, their effect on innovation and the extent of spillovers to other industries is yet to be established.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Economic diversification, following the 2014 shock to world oil prices, is a main policy objective. Since the rebound in oil sector investment (evidenced by several large new oilfields being developed and the expanded maintenance of existing fields) after the oil price started to recover from 2016, the government has kept diversification as a central element of its policy. The administration identifies the aluminium industry, the healthcare sector, fish farming and fisheries, and green technology as potential areas for growth. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect substantial progress to be made in the medium term. This is due to the specialisation of the mainland economy in the oil sector; the government's fiscal policy, which allows limited room for state support to new industries; and diversification's diminished political salience now that oil prices have recovered.
In recent years the government's main priority has been to improve Norway's competitiveness by trying to bring tax and wage levels closer to those of its peers. The government hopes that this will boost activity and investment in non-oil tradable sectors. A multiparty agreement in 2015, aimed at reducing the headline rate of corporate tax from 27% to 23% in 2018, has been implemented, and a further reduction to 22% has been agreed for 2019. Efforts have also been made to reduce bureaucracy and public-sector inefficiencies.
Norway's fiscal policy framework is designed to insulate the budget from fluctuations in oil and gas revenue, with the government responsible for transferring the state's net oil revenue to the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund), which is currently valued at Nkr9trn (US$1trn). According to Norway's fiscal rule, the government can use up to 3% of the fund's value annually, which corresponds to the estimated real return. The crash in oil prices in late 2014, and the following contraction in petroleum revenue and investment, led to smaller fiscal surpluses. The government counteracted the slowdown with a more expansionary fiscal stance, withdrawing more from the fund than it transferred. However, since 2016 the government has gradually tightened policy, reducing the fiscal impulse. As the oil industry recovers in the 2019-23 forecast period, fiscal policy will tighten further.

The 2019 budget, agreed between the ruling coalition and the Christian Democrats (KrF) in November 2018, has a fiscally neutral impact, contrasting with the fiscal stimulus in 2016. We expect the fiscal surplus in 2019 to average 6.5%, which partially reflects lower global energy prices on average. In 2020-23 the surplus should remain large, at an average of 6.9%, supported by strengthening oil prices, a pick-up in petroleum investment activity and steady economic growth. Strong wage growth, which helped to drive the surplus to 7.2% of GDP in 2018, will also support fiscal stability. The 2019 budget complies with the fiscal rule and estimates that withdrawals from the fund will total Nkr231.5bn (US$27.1bn), which is about 2.7% of the fund's estimated capital as at early 2019. The government's emphasis on improving competitiveness remains central to its fiscal plans, which include a further reduction in the corporate tax rate, and a long-term plan for research and higher education. This comprises three new investment initiatives amounting to Nkr1.5bn in 2019-22.

Norges Bank (the central bank), having initiated its tightening cycle in September 2018 and continued it in March 2019, is expected to raise rates twice in 2019 at its June and December meetings. The krone has remained stable against the US dollar and the euro since the start of 2019, reflecting the largely stable price of oil, freeing the bank to take greater action to bring elevated inflation towards its 2% target. From 2020 we expect Norges Bank to continue tightening at a more gradual pace, taking the policy rate to 2.5% by end-2023.
Norges Bank kept its main policy rate (on sight deposits) at a record-low 0.5% from March 2016 until September 2018, when it raised it to 0.75%. It then raised it by a further 25 basis points in March 2019, to 1%. Norges Bank targets inflation of "close to 2% over time". Nevertheless, contrary to its neighbours, its mandate is flexible to ensure stable output and employment, and to avoid the build-up of financial imbalances.
The bank adopted a more hawkish stance at its March meeting, signalling a faster pace of tightening in the near term, in response to stronger than expected inflation, which rose to 2.8% in 2018, from 1.9% in 2017, and remains elevated, at 3% from January to April 2019. We expect two more rises in 2019, lifting the rate to 1.5% in December. Strong core inflation and a tight labour market will strengthen nominal wage growth, pushing up domestic inflation, which we expect to remain above target until 2021. Norges Bank also wants to address household leverage in the country, which continued to grow in 2018, albeit at a slower pace; in October-December 2018 household debt totalled 218% of gross disposable income.

Strengthening oil output should support output growth over 2019-23
We expect growth to remain stable at 1.7% in 2019, from 1.8% in 2018, but this will be lower than the 2.7% expansion recorded in 2017. This slowdown will be due in part to strong growth of imports, which weighed on output in the first quarter, bringing annual growth to 1.4%. We expect the economy to strengthen later this year and over the forecast period, owing to resurgent petroleum-related investment, improved export performance (once technical difficulties on oil platforms in the North Sea are rectified) and solid wage growth driving private consumption. These factors should be supported by the gradual fall in inflation and the reduction of tax rates by the ruling coalition. We believe that these factors will outweigh the contractionary effects of steady monetary policy tightening by Norges Bank.
Risks to our short-term outlook are well balanced. On the one hand, downside risks stem from potential oil price volatility and the fallout from a steeper trajectory of monetary tightening. The ongoing US-China trade dispute could also escalate, impacting export growth, although this is not our baseline scenario. On the other hand, upside risks stem from the prospect of stronger than expected investment and wage growth.
We expect real GDP growth to remain close to potential, at an average of 2% in 2020-23. Investment growth should ease during this period, as the number of major oilfield development projects is lower than in the past, and fewer discoveries were made in 2018 to justify increasing future investment levels.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Norway's sectoral balance has changed only modestly since the exploitation of the country's oil reserves in the 1970s, which placed the oil and gas industry in a prime position in the Norwegian economy, composing about a fifth of GDP in 2018. Common to most developed economies, the services sector is the mainstay of Norway's output, contributing about 68.8% to the country's GDP in 2018, according to the World Bank. This share is below Norway's peer economies in Scandinavia: Finland and Denmark's share of services output is 77.3% and 71.3% respectively. The impact of other sectors, namely agriculture, fishing and forestry; and manufacturing, is also fairly muted, at just 1.9% and 6.3% of GDP respectively. Both sectors are predominantly export oriented, with fishing exports constituting 9.6% of all exports in 2018, and manufactures 8.5%.
Norway's cold climate and undulating landscape are not suited to farming
Norway's agricultural sector has a smaller role than that of its neighbours, providing 1.9% of GDP. The harsh winter weather, an undulating landscape not suited to agriculture and limited economies of scale in farming (about 60% of all Norwegian farms have less than 20 hectares of agricultural land) have all restrained output. Pastoral farming (of sheep, pigs and cows) contributes the most to total agricultural output-about 64.4%, according to Eurostat. Despite its small size, farming is well diversified, with no one produce for livestock, dairy and agricultural goods taking up more than 30% of production.
The oil and gas sector has been a mainstay of Norwegian prosperity since oil was first exploited in Norway, primarily in the North Sea (on the country's west coast) in the 1970s, but recent factors have pushed the sector into decline. The sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 caused the industry's share of GDP to drop from a peak of 25% in 2012 to 14% in 2016. The recovery in oil prices since mid-2014 has encouraged a modest revival in the sector, to 19% of GDP in 2018, and the near-term outlook remains favourable for oil production. By year-end 2018, 83 fields were producing-slightly fewer than in 2017 (when there were 85), and 14 new fields were in development, including Johan Sverdrup, the fifth-largest oil discovery ever made in Norwegian waters, which will account for 30% of all Norwegian oil production by the mid-2020s, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), a government agency. This leads us to expect a slight revival in oil production in Norway from its expected nadir in 2019, owing to higher prices and a stronger base of production, albeit not to the scale of the sector's peak in the mid-2000s. This rise in production has been presaged by an improvement in oil sector investment over the past six months.
Various concerns are making politicians wary of further oil sector growth
The long-term outlook for oil sector production remains uncertain. Although production peaked in 2001, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), recent investment and a series of new discoveries have the potential to maintain oil production throughout the forecast period. However, various pressures are limiting the appetite of policymakers for further oil sector expansion. Firstly, there is a need for diversification in Norway's economy, highlighted by the damaging effects of the sharp decline in the oil sector since 2014. Secondly, environmental concerns have influenced government policy. The Liberals, as part of their agreement to enter government in January 2018, extracted a guarantee that oil exploration would not reach the Lofoten islands-a peninsula to the north of Norway-extending an arrangement that had been in place over 2013-17. Thirdly, the generous tax system for oil exploration, which refunds 78% of oil exploration costs, has been coming under increasing political pressure within the Labour Party. These pressures will probably constrain the oil sector's influence on the economy throughout the forecast period.
Since the exploitation of oil, Norway's manufacturing sector has receded in economic importance, from 17.7% in 1970, according to the World Bank, to 6.3% in 2017. This decline has been more pronounced than that of Norway's peer economies. Denmark, Sweden and Finland all have manufacturing sectors that comprise more than 12% of GDP. Manufacturing is split between an oil-oriented component, dominated by machinery, chemicals and ship-building, and a consumer-oriented component, based on production of food and beverages. The decline in oil prices in 2014 caused a sharp fall in machinery and chemicals production, leaving food and beverages the largest component of Norwegian manufacturing in 2018. Despite some government initiatives to support diversification away from the oil sector, the perpetually strong krona will keep the outlook for a wider recovery in the manufacturing industry muted.
The oil sector has supported shipping and engineering service growth
The services sector is expected to continue its steady growth throughout the forecast, growing in primacy as oil output recedes. The sector consists of business services common to advanced economies, with retail trade and financial services taking up a large share of output. Norway's geographical location and the extent of the oil industry has also enabled transport and shipping, alongside other professional or technical services (such as engineering, chemicals and research), to develop outside the oil sector, and Norwegian firms like Aker ASA and Yara International can compete globally.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 52.9 51.9 54.1 56.9 59.8 61.5
Inflation is expected to recede gradually in 2019, as rising wages are counterbalanced by falling prices in electricity and energy. A spike in energy prices in 2018, owing to a decline in rainfall and hydroelectricity production, drove inflation to an average of 2.8%, up from 1.9% in 2017. These effects have largely passed and, together with cheaper oil prices in 2019, imply that inflation should ease to 2.6% on average. Monthly data for early 2019 have borne this out, and annual price growth has receded slightly. Price pressures will remain firm throughout 2019-23, owing to healthy wage growth.

Purchasing power parity Nkr:US$ (av) 10.44 10.53 10.46 10.68 10.87 10.98
The krone tends to follow developments in global energy markets, and has depreciated significantly on average against the US dollar and the euro since 2013. In 2019 we believe that the krone will depreciate slightly against the euro-a trend that will continue into 2020. This is primarily due to the falling price of oil, Norway's primary export, which weakens the country's terms of trade and undermines the amount of revenue that the state receives. After 2020, we judge the krone will remain largely stable as rebounding oil prices are counterbalanced by an end to monetary tightening. A sharp market reaction to the accelerated pace of tightening by Norges Bank, which will strengthen the krone, is a risk to our exchange-rate forecast.
We do not expect the krone to return to pre-2014 levels; since the sharp correction of oil prices in late 2014, investors have become more concerned about Norway's lack of economic diversification, and other factors-such as global monetary policy stances and geopolitical factors-have contributed more heavily to the krone's movements.

Rising imports of capital goods will reduce the current-account surplus
We expect that the current-account surplus will fall slightly in 2019, owing to the surge in import demand from investment projects, falling oil prices and declining production of oil in the North Sea (due to technical difficulties on some platforms). This should bring the current-account surplus to 7.7% of GDP in 2019, compared with 8.1% in 2018, despite the continued strong performance of the primary income balance.
Following the slippage in oil prices from 2014, Norway's dependable current-account surplus shrank, reaching a two-decade low (4%) in 2016. Falling oil prices in 2019 will place downward pressure on the current account, although surpluses are largely guaranteed by the vibrant oil sector and the Government Pension Fund Global, which supports Norway's substantial primary income balance. In 2020-23 the structure of the current account should remain unchanged, and we expect the surplus to remain large, averaging 9.2% of GDP.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Norway
Stocks and flows
Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) had been elevated prior to the sharp fall in oil prices in 2014, averaging US$18.9bn in 2007-12, with significant declines in the wake of the financial crisis and alongside fluctuations in the oil market. After the drop in oil prices in 2014, inward FDI flows weakened significantly, turning negative in 2016, at the nadir of the oil sector's performance. Inward flows also turned sharply negative in 2018, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this disinvestment to ease over the forecast period, turning positive in 2020, in line with the strengthening of the oil sector. However, these flows are unlikely to reach the levels seen before 2014. By end-2018 stocks of inward FDI stood at US$230.9bn, or about 53% of GDP, although this will fall to about 44% by 2023. At US$43,395 per head, FDI remains above that of the EU15 and many peer economics in Scandinavia, with Finland and Iceland at US$29,147 and US$17,839 respectively.
Origin and distribution
Norway's oil-intensive economy means that FDI is largely focused on the oil and gas sector, in addition to ancillary services such as transport, infrastructure and finance. Most of the world's major oil and gas companies are involved in Norwegian oil production, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon (all US-based), BP, BG (both UK), Eni (Italy), RWE Dea (Germany) and Engie (France). FDI data for 2017, released by Statistics Norway, show that about 27% of all FDI goes to mining and quarrying (including the oil sector), whereas manufacturing, the next highest recipient, gets 14.2%. Financial services are also an important beneficiary of foreign investment, taking about 10.4%. Both manufacturing and financial services have considerable overlap with the oil and gas sector. The bulk of Norwegian inward FDI has its origins in fellow European countries, with the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK in the top five investor countries, with these three jointly holding about 40% of all FDI in Norway. The US has become a more prominent investor in Norway in recent years, now holding 15% of all foreign investment in 2017-higher than the 9% held by the US in 2014.
Determinants
The Norwegian government operates a system to encourage and regulate the exploitation of oil within its waters (the country has no onshore oil production). To ensure that the exploration of oil is intensive in previously explored, or "mature", areas, the government awards licences for the exploration of these regions annually-as opposed to unexplored, "frontier", areas, for which licences are awarded once every two years. This awards system has been in place since 2003 and comes with a taxation system, in place since 2005, which rewards exploration but penalises excessive production. The government imposes a special additional tax of 51%, on top of an oil-sector tax rate of 27%, on wells that are producing oil-higher than the marginal tax rate for UK oil producers, which stands at 40%. This high rate of taxation is compensated by a feature that enables upstream companies to write off 78% of losses on oil exploration if the search for oil proves unsuccessful. The presence of oil has led to high FDI stocks, but an onerous tax burden, high wages, Norway's limited market size and high house prices are all factors that restrain further growth in foreign investment. The market size is slightly limited by Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives Norwegian firms full access to the wider European market. But Norway's trade access is made slightly more uncertain by Norway's retention of its own currency, the krone, which moves alongside fluctuations in the oil price and adds to exchange-rate risk.
Impact
FDI has encouraged a sustained transfer of foreign knowledge to Norway and has accelerated the development of the oil and gas sector. The oil sector has, in turn, encouraged wider growth in the mainland economy, through higher wages and stronger consumer spending but also through ancillary services such as transport and finance. Several of these ancillary services, notably the supply and maintenance services, have become internationally competitive, despite the strong krone. Moreover, high taxation on developed oil wells has led to a resilient fiscal balance and vast sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund Global, which is used as a "nest egg" for future public spending and an additional stock of public spending when fiscal stimulus is needed, as was the case after the 2014 slide in oil prices. Despite the sector's large influence on the wider economy, its impact on employment is limited, as just 1% of the labour force is involved in offshore activities. Much FDI outside sectors related to the oil and gas industry is through purchases of existing companies rather than the setting up of new companies or facilities. Slow progress on selling government stakes in a number of part-publicly owned companies may dampen FDI flows.
Potential
Despite recent efforts by the government to induce more investment and private-sector activity by reducing the tax burden, the economy will still remain broadly unattractive to foreign investment owing to high labour costs. Although the population is highly educated and well trained, many of the non-oil, non-agricultural industries remain centred in Oslo, the capital. The government has made the wider development of the "High North" (the areas adjacent to the Arctic) a wider policy priority, offering various incentives and grants, including a reduction in the scale of employer contributions, as the government attempts to encourage stronger growth in the maritime, healthcare and information technology sectors there also. Nevertheless, the bulk of opportunities for foreign investment will remain in the energy sector, encompassing oil, gas and green energy (notably wind power).

A decline in net migration has slowed population growth in recent years
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the population to maintain its steady rate of growth over the forecast period (2019-23), although long-run factors, such as the ageing of the population and the trend towards smaller family sizes, will weigh on population growth in the coming years. Spurred by the solid expansion in the economy, high levels of migration from eastern Europe and the wealth effect of a steady rise in house prices, population growth has been consistently above 1% since 2007, averaging about 1.3% in 2008-14, according to Statistics Norway. Since the start of 2013 the growth rate of the population has declined, from 1.3% to 0.7% in 2018, as the economic outlook has become more uncertain, reducing both births and immigration. Net immigration has declined from its post-crisis peak of more than 48,700 in 2012 to just 18,000 in 2018, driven by a subsiding of the migrant crisis in 2016 and a tightening of migration rules for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We expect the stronger economic environment to encourage some strengthening of population growth over the forecast, owing to both higher levels of economic migration and a stronger rate of natural increase among the domestic population.
Net migration has fallen since 2012, despite a rise in asylum-seekers
Net migration, which reached a peak of more than 47,000 in 2012, has been more subdued in recent years as migration from eastern Europe has subsided, to just 18,000. The arrival of more than 3,500 asylum-seekers from Syria in 2018 made up the bulk of recent inflows, but the 2018 data showed a significant decline on the previous year, when immigration from Syria amounted to more than 6,800 migrants. Despite these recent arrivals, Polish migrants remain the largest group within the migrant population, at a total of 98,961, according to 2019 data from Statistics Norway. This is followed by Lithuanians (39,300), Swedes (35,580) and Syrians (30,800). Strong migration inflows earlier in the decade should revive Norway's declining fertility rate, which peaked in 2009 at 1.98 (still below the replacement rate), and medical improvements should continue to raise life expectancy. Over the forecast period we expect the population to age gradually, with more than 18% of the population over the age of 67 by 2023, and we also expect a deceleration in the growth of the working-age population, from an average of 0.7% growth in 2014-18 to 0.6% in 2019-23.
The demographic challenge is not as severe as in other European countries
Despite this gradual ageing of the population, Norway's near-term demographic profile remains supportive for further economic growth. The share of the population below the age of 15, at 17.8%, is one of the highest in Europe (the comparable figure for the EU28 is 15.6%, according to Eurostat), encouraging a continued expansion in demand for consumer goods and housing, alongside innovation in the services sector. Growth in the young population will also mitigate the economic impact of an ageing population. The proportion of the elderly population (defined as over the age of 67) is smaller than other European economies, but this share is expected to rise steadily, in step with trends across developed countries. Norway is expected to face some economic penalties stemming from an aging population, as the burden of caring for the elderly population is placed on a smaller proportion of employed workers. However, we do not expect these effects to hinder economic growth until after 2023. Nonetheless, demographic concerns have motivated significant policy action since 1990, with the creation of the Government Pension Fund Global, Norway's vast sovereign wealth fund, partially motivated by a need to fund expanded health and social spending to care for an ageing population.
Owing to Norway's unique geography, with a long coastline and separated settlements, rural areas are far more dispersed than in other European countries, raising the cost of services provision for isolated communities. This is aggravated by an increasingly concentrated population as a whole, with 81.9% of Norway's population living in urban areas. Areas in the far north of Norway are remote and underpopulated; Finnmark, the northernmost county, had a population of just 75,000 in 2014. The cost of maintaining public service provision in rural areas was a central driver behind the "municipal reform" proposed by the Conservative-led government in 2014.

Despite its high wealth, Norway small market size limits its influence
Despite being one of the richest countries in the world (by GDP per head), Norway's limited population size, of just over 5m, and the country's high operating costs limit the scale of market opportunities available. When ranking countries by nominal GDP per head, Norway is third highest in the world, at US$81,695, according to the IMF, ahead of the rest of the OECD excluding Luxembourg and Switzerland. Measured using a purchasing power parity (PPP) measure, Norway performs less well, positioned sixth, with a GDP per head of US$74,356. This is due to the country's higher price level and the correspondingly weaker purchasing power of the currency in Norway, reflecting higher costs for labour and transport. However, despite the country's wealth, its overall economic size remains fairly small, with nominal GDP at just US$435bn, according to the IMF. Although this is larger than Finland (US$275bn), output is slightly smaller than in Austria (US$460bn) and Sweden (US$547bn), demonstrating Norway's limited size relative to other global markets. The OECD estimated Norway's Gini coefficient at 0.262 in 2016, the fifth-lowest in the group of advanced economies (a Gini coefficient of zero represents perfect income equality and 100 displays total income inequality). This low score reflects the low level of inequality in Norway, ensured by relatively high levels of marginal taxation and the high levels of trust and co-operation within its society.
Norway's consumer goods market is similar to those of other Scandinavian countries, albeit larger than Denmark's and smaller than Sweden's. Private consumption accounted for about 44.9% of overall GDP in 2018. Consumption growth accelerated in the late 1990s until 2007, averaging 4.1% year on year from 1996-2007 and contributing an average of 1.5 percentage points to annual economic growth over the period. Since the financial crisis, consumption growth has fallen, averaging 2.5% in 2010-18. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this slowdown to continue over the 2019-23 forecast period, to an average of 1.8%, as investment takes a larger role in output growth. Nevertheless, the fundamental components for growth in consumption are in place. Unemployment is low, price growth has been receding in recent releases, and nominal wages have started to accelerate. By 2023 we expect GDP per head to reach US$97,791 at market exchange rates and US$72,263 at PPP exchange rates.

Norway's consumer market is highly developed, with room for competition
As an advanced, mature economy, Norway's consumers are well equipped with most consumer durables, including white goods, television sets, personal computers and home entertainment equipment. Much of consumer demand will be driven by a need to improve or replace existing consumer durables, a process aided by technological innovation. The non-food market is relatively open to competition, with many small, medium-sized and niche players competing. As the extent of domestic manufacturing remains limited the bulk of consumer goods are imported. High labour costs are one of the few downsides to producing in Norway, at about EUR50 (US$56) per hour, the hourly labour costs are among the highest in Scandinavia and the second highest in Europe after Switzerland (which has an hourly cost of EUR53 per hour). Norway also imports many agricultural products, especially fruit and vegetables. Fish are mostly domestically produced, as Norway has established itself as a global exporter of seafood, especially salmon.
Norwegian consumer spending tends to be leisure-focused
Norwegians tend to spend a higher proportion of their total income on food than most other European populations, although we expect this figure to fall during the forecast period. In part, this will reflect high tariffs and taxes on food products, as well as limited competition within the food retail sector. A higher proportion of spending is directed towards leisure, including hotel stays and restaurants. The standard of living is generally high, with two out of ten households owning more than one car and a similar proportion owning a second (or holiday) home. Among the sociological trends that will have an impact on consumption patterns are a rise in single-person households and the gradual ageing of the population.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Stemming the trend for early retirement is a long-term government challenge
Initial conditions: Aided by its rich endowment of offshore oil and gas, Norway's growth has outperformed that of its European neighbours over the past decade, with growth averaging 1.2% in 2008-18, compared with a euro area average of 0.8%. With only 48% of its petroleum reserves extracted to date, the country will retain its pre-eminence in European energy production throughout The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term forecast period, to 2050. However, pressures on the oil and gas sector are expected to mount over the short term as production is curtailed by technical difficulties, and over the longer term as government policy becomes less accommodative. Although participation rates are already high, one long-term challenge for the government will be to reverse the trend among older workers to take early retirement. To this effect, the pension system is undergoing reform, including by reducing longevity risk through a pension adjustment linked to life expectancy, and will be fully implemented by 2025. Technological change has also accelerated Norway's growth in recent years, with the application of communication and information technology becoming more widespread since 2008 and supporting productivity growth. However, the tightness of the labour market could dampen productivity growth in the near term as skills shortages appear in some sectors. Further risk factors are a slowing pace of product market reforms and Norway's comparatively poor record of investing in research and development (R&D), which accounts for about only 2.1% of GDP, and lifelong learning.
Demographic trends: Norway, like many other OECD countries, faces a steadily ageing population, driven by both a socioeconomic trend towards a lower birth rate and a preference for marrying later that have been evident since the 1960s. However, in the Norwegian case these trends have been slower to materialise, and immigration is higher than in the country's European neighbours, so Norway is in a more favourable position to face the challenges of an ageing population relative to other developed countries. Owing to consistent inward migration from eastern Europe and a comparatively large share of young people in the population, Norway will maintain positive population growth throughout the forecast period (2019-23), although the rate of growth will fall from the 2020s onwards. The growth rate of the working-age population will also remain positive, but will ease from about 1% per year from 2000-18 to about 0.5% in 2019-50. Concurrently, the proportion of those aged 67 or above, and the old-age dependency ratio (those 67 and over relative to those aged 15-66) will increase, leading to greater fiscal pressure on the government, which provides old age services and transfers. Further rises in the participation rate (which is already among the highest in the world) or improvements to worker productivity will be needed to maintain the social safety net.
Even taking into account the flow of oil revenue, pension liabilities will greatly exceed the expected assets of the entire Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund that was created to ensure that future generations would benefit from the country's oil riches). There is concern that current pension reforms do not go far enough in tackling the problems related to work incentives and the generous scale of public-sector pensions. The government will need to take further action over the coming decade to avoid a sharply rising tax burden from 2023.
Slower European growth will hinder Norway's trade position
External conditions: As a small country that is highly dependent on open markets and free trade, Norway stands to benefit from its European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which extends the EU's single market to include it. The EU is the world's largest and most integrated regional market, and accounts for the vast majority of Norwegian exports and imports. Set against this, the EU's long-term rate of growth is likely to remain moderate. Another uncertainty over the forecast period concerns Norway's position with respect to the EU. Within the EU, although some progress will be made in further advancing trade in goods and the liberalisation of trade in services, the focus-particularly in the next decade-will be on ensuring that there is no reversal of these policies, and especially on trying to prevent the break-up of the euro zone and on preserving the single market. In this context the UK's withdrawal from the EU has the potential to be disruptive. Meanwhile the increase in protectionism seen since Donald Trump became US president poses a concern for such a small, open economy. Although some effort has gone into improving Norway-China economic relations, we expect returns from these activities to be confined to specific sectors, such as fish or oil exports, limiting their effectiveness.
The sovereign wealth fund may not be adequate to guarantee pension costs
Institutions and policy trends: Norway has a long democratic history and enjoys stable, democratic and transparent institutions, along with a well-entrenched justice system. Corruption is largely absent from Norwegian political and business life. The prospects for stable growth are enhanced by high levels of benefits and state-funded education, including at tertiary level, which ensures a healthy and well-educated workforce. In the long term, however, the welfare state may not be as well funded as it is currently. Norway favours free enterprise and market competition to a lesser extent than Denmark and Sweden. The state remains a significant player in many sectors, such as telecommunications, banking, energy and the offshore sector, and progress on the government's plan to reduce its stakes in some companies has been slow. Norway also lags neighbouring countries in efforts to promote com-petition in major product and labour markets, in part because the country's oil riches provide little incentive for policymakers to enact potentially unpopular structural reforms. Similarly, there is a risk that the existence of the GPFG will mask the need for reforms to the social security system. A pension reform in 2011 improved incentives to work beyond retirement age and cut the link between pension payments and wages; further adjustments are expected in the coming years. However, government projections indicate that the assets of the pension fund will be insufficient to cover the state's liabilities arising from pensions and other demands on the public purse (such as healthcare) in the absence of further reform of both the pension system and the labour market. Measures would have to include further discouragement from taking early retirement or drawing disability benefits. (The proportion of the workforce drawing disability benefit in Norway is almost double the average for the OECD.) Ensuring the sustainability of Norway's generous welfare state will be an important challenge for future governments.
Strong investment and productivity growth will raise long term output
Long-term performance: As Norway has less scope than most other developed economies to raise its labour force participation rate, its long-term economic prospects will depend on a continued high rate of investment, as well as improvements in productivity, which we expect to rise during the forecast period (to an average of 0.9% in 2017-50), having been sluggish for much of the past decade (at an average of 0.2% in 2007-16). Long-term economic performance will also depend on how successive governments meet the challenge of structural reform. Given the current large surpluses on the general government budget, it is often easy for policymakers to ignore non-oil budget deficits. A failure to adapt social security and welfare systems to the challenge of population ageing would lead to large fiscal deficits towards the end of the long-term forecast period, which would necessitate a rising tax burden and dampen growth. This would be exacerbated should oil production decrease markedly, making continued investment in exploration important.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
The majority of Norway's emissions come from the exploitation of the country's oil and gas reserves, with aluminium production also contributing. Domestic energy usage, which is largely met through abundant hydro-electric infrastructure, is not an important contributor to Norway's carbon emissions, unlike in other advanced economies. The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) has become more strident in its support of environmental concerns over the past few years. In 2016 two new criteria were established by the fund, making it move away from, firstly, companies with unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions and, secondly, companies for which at least 30% of revenue is derived from thermal coal, or operations based on thermal coal. In March 2019 the government established a further criterion forcing the fund to divest from upstream firms specialising in oil and gas exploration, although its holdings of generalised energy firms, including all major publicly traded oil producers, have remained.
Norway will be relatively sheltered from the impact of climate change. With a small agricultural sector and a mostly urban population, the country is easily protected from the results of a warming planet. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's newly launched climate change model, Norway's GDP will only fall by about 1% by 2050, relative to a world without climate change. With the majority of economic output concentrated in the area around Oslo, the capital, and the coastal cities of Bergan, Stavanger and Trondheim, the protection of urban areas against rising sea levels and weather events will be central to Norway's strategy. The opening up of new areas for oil exploration in the Arctic Circle (as ice cover falls) will be an upside risk to Norwegian growth and should slightly mitigate the costs to output.
Despite efforts by successive governments to bolster environmental policy, a substantial effort to reduce oil-related activities is unlikely, with further reform only likely to limit the sector's growth, rather than reverse it. Aided by the economic need for further diversification, political pressure is mounting from smaller parties, like the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (both of which are central to the coalition's majority) and an environmental element within the Labour Party to curtail the oil sector's development. This division within parliament is likely to be reflected in a gradual erosion of the country's generous tax incentives for oil exploration over the long term.
Migration and urbanisation
Norway has largely adopted an accommodative policy towards migration since the late 1970s and the migrant population (including those of Norwegian birth, but with two parents born abroad) in 2017 was about 888,700, making up 16.8% of the country's total population. Immigration to Norway has risen steadily over the decades-in 1992 migrants totalled about 183,000 people (4.3% of Norway's population) and net migration was relatively small (9,100). Net migration steadily rose thereafter, peaking in 2012 as 48,700 people entered the country, before dropping to 27,800 in 2016. The bulk of these migrants came from eastern Europe after the region's transition into the EU in 2004, but there remains a significant portion of German and Swedish migrants in Norway (totalling about 60,900 in 2016). Recent migration has come from non-European countries such as Syria, Somalia and Eritrea. These migrants have proved more politically contentious, as greater differences in cultural background and socioeconomic status have led to concerns about integration-the far-right Progress Party (FrP) has now included the reduction of non-European migration as part of its policy agenda. Although the FrP is a member of the centre-right coalition government, we expect Norway's collaborative political system to result in moderate government policy and the country to retain an accommodative stance on matters of immigration and integration.
Norway's population has become more urbanised as the economy has developed. According to the World Bank, urbanisation rates surpassed 50% in 1960, rising rapidly over the next 20 years to 70.5% in 1980. Since then the pace of urban growth has been more subdued, with the rate only surpassing 80% in 2013, and reaching 82% 2017. Norway remains the most rural of the Scandinavian economies, with urbanisation rates in Sweden and Denmark slightly higher, at 87% and 88% respectively. This is in part due to Norway's large land area and long sea coast, making rural communities more isolated, but also because Norway was historically rural and underdeveloped compared with its Scandinavian peers, and so has further to catch up with its neighbours. The difficulties of paying for high standards of public service provision to an ageing and diminishing population in rural areas are putting pressure on the government to reduce costs. This was the motivation behind the "municipal reform" circulated in 2014 which will aggregate the municipal and county authorities together to encourage greater economies of scale and information-sharing in local government services.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. [...]of their electoral rivalry, as well as disagreements over issues such as infrastructure projects and the tenure in government of two Lega officials linked to graft allegations, M5S and the Lega have clashed frequently in recent months. [...]the administration has also approved a new anti-corruption law, as well as a security decree containing a series of tougher policing and immigration measures, and a growth decree meant to jump-start business activity. [...]we believe that the ECB will be reluctant to lift its deposit rate until June 2020.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The March 2018 general election produced a badly fragmented parliament. It also yielded a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won about 33% of the vote, and the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic Lega, which secured about 17%. Following tortuous government formation talks, which almost ended inconclusively, at end-May the two parties agreed to form a government, led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent.
Mr Conte and his technocratic economy minister, Giovanni Tria, have experienced tensions with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, and Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader, both of whom serve as deputy prime ministers. Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini are the de facto political leaders of the government, which The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to complete a five-year term, ending in 2023. Amid a slowing economy and a resounding victory at the European Parliament elections, we believe that Mr Salvini is likely to press for an early election in late 2019. The soonest feasible date for a snap election would be sometime in early 2020.
The government will continue to prioritise tougher stances on migration and more defiant positions on EU rules, as well as the disarming of so-called safeguard clauses in the country's fiscal framework that would raise indirect taxes from 2020 if other consolidation measures are not approved. The government is also implementing means-tested "citizenship income" and is planning a "growth decree" to support the economy.
Following a protracted dispute with the European Commission over its draft 2019 budget plan, the government narrowly avoided the launch of an excessive-deficit procedure in mid-December. Tensions are likely to ratchet up during the 2020 budget process, however, as the Lega is demanding the implementation of a costly "flat" income tax proposal, while the Commission believes that Italy is non-compliant with its rules on public debt reduction.
We expect Italian real GDP to stagnate in 2019, growing by just 0.1%. Risks to this forecast are balanced to the downside. This is likely to put this year's revised fiscal deficit target of 2.4% of GDP out of reach. Weaker economic growth and a wider deficit also mean that the government's goal of lowering the government debt/GDP ratio from 132.4% at end-2018 is unlikely to be achieved. Our core forecast for growth in 2020-23 is also weak, owing to slowing momentum both domestically and in the euro area. We forecast real GDP growth of 0.4% in 2020 and about 1.1% on average in 2021-23.

Italy's business environment score improves modestly in the 2019-23 forecast period. Reforms since 2012 have helped to raise the scores for foreign investment, financing and the labour market. Some of these will be reversed or diluted.
Country forecast overview: Italy's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Significant reforms to improve competition will not be a priority under the Conte administration.
2021-23: Improvements in competition policy will depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Modest reductions in red tape. Government plans to charge penalties to foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2021-23: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. The Conte government could oppose new EU trade deals. EU focuses on EU-UK trade deal in Brexit negotiations, further bilateral free-trade deals and responding to US tariffs.
2021-23: An EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive. The risk of a euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to leave the bloc in the medium term.
Taxes
2019-20: Automatic rise in value-added tax (VAT) rate is averted in 2019, but implementation of two-rate "flat tax" is delayed owing to cost. Reduction in tax expenditure and some tax rises in order to finance costly social spending plans.
2021-23: Government seeks to implement a diluted corporate and income tax-reduction package.
Financing
2019-20: Bank mergers, recapitalisations and non-performing loan sales are slow, not least given political uncertainty.
2021-23: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market
2019-20: Firms remain reluctant to increase open-ended contract payrolls. Universal unemployment benefit or "citizenship income" may be partly introduced. Some aspects of 2014-15 labour market reforms will be reversed.
2021-23: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Lack of fiscal space constrains government plans for higher investment spending.
2021-23: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) presses for further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keep research and development (R&D) spending low.
2021-23: Gradually improving economic prospects, as well as Brexit, encourage more information and communications technology graduates to seek work in Italy. Slight improvement in R&D and firm-level technology investment.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had three broad centre-left/centre-right governments. Matteo Renzi's resignation as prime minister after his flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum in December 2016 led to the formation of a government led by Paolo Gentiloni, a close ally of Mr Renzi. Following the 2018 general election an M5S-Lega government was formed.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December 2016 referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house). A new, predominantly proportional electoral system was adopted in October 2017.
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which stood at 132.2% of GDP in 2018), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process has since stalled, and the M5S-Lega government will seek to loosen fiscal policy, stimulate private consumption through tax cuts and income support to low earners, and seek to reverse or dilute recent pension and labour reforms.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes are levied, including the regional business tax (IRAP), to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.5%, reduced from 3.9% in 2014. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$537.5bn in 2018, and imports (fob) were worth US$481.9bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$50.6bn, or 2.4% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Just a year into its five-year term, the coalition government composed of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the far-right Lega is showing signs of strain. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the cabinet will fracture in late 2019, probably over difficult negotiations on the 2020 budget law, leading to an early election in the first half of next year. At this contest we expect the Lega to win a commanding majority in parliament at the head of a right-wing coalition including the centre-right Forza Italia and the small, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia.
The coalition-led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent law professor-came into office in the wake of the March 2018 general election, at which M5S won 33% of the vote and the Lega won 17%. Since then, however, the Lega has dominated the government under the leadership of Matteo Salvini, a deputy prime minister and minister of the interior, who has struck a chord with Italian voters with his round-talking speeches, adept use of social media and a policy agenda focused on security issues, Euroscepticism and combating illegal immigration.
Meanwhile M5S's popularity has ebbed steadily under the leadership of Luigi Di Maio, also a deputy prime minister and the labour and economic development minister. Following disappointing performances in a series of regional and local elections in 2018-19 M5S won just 17% of the vote at the European Parliament elections on May 26th, compared with the Lega's 34%. Mr Di Maio has since come under internal pressure and was forced to call an online vote among M5S members at end-May to reaffirm his authority.
As a result of their electoral rivalry, as well as disagreements over issues such as infrastructure projects and the tenure in government of two Lega officials linked to graft allegations, M5S and the Lega have clashed frequently in recent months. This led Mr Conte to issue an ultimatum to Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini in early June, urging his deputies to put their quarrels aside or else accept his resignation.
Mr Conte will not step down in the near term, as the tone of political debate is likely to soften in the aftermath of the European Parliament vote, but negotiations on the 2020 budget may prove to be an insurmountable challenge. The budget law will draw intense scrutiny from the European Commission, which will press to open an excessive-deficit procedure against Italy for failing to reduce the public debt stock and demand a significant fiscal correction that the government is unwilling to deliver.
At the same time Mr Salvini has renewed his demands for a flat corporate and personal income tax rate of 15%, which would be unaffordable in the absence of deep spending cuts or rises in other forms of taxation. The government will also seek to disarm the so-called safeguard clauses written into the country's multi-year fiscal framework, which would raise the headline value-added tax (VAT) rate from an already high 22% to 25.2% if EUR23bn (1.3% of GDP) is not raised through spending cuts or other revenue sources. Against this backdrop, a combination of financial market pressures, electoral opportunism on Mr Salvini's behalf and political pressure from the EU institutions are expected to cause the administration to unravel, paving the way for a snap election in 2020.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The next parliamentary election is scheduled for early 2023, but we expect it to be held much sooner. Mr Salvini will probably try to capitalise on his party's gains in support by pulling the plug on the administration. Such a move would be an attempt to force the president, Sergio Mattarella, to call a snap general election if he cannot find an alternative governing majority in parliament.
The result of the European Parliament elections has raised the likelihood that such a break will happen late this year. When combined with the Lega's vote share of 34%, those of Forza Italia (9%) and Fratelli d'Italia (6%) come to about 50%, which would be likely to produce a commanding majority under Italy's voting law for general elections. This system, the so-called Rosatellum 2, allocates about a third of the seats in each house of parliament in single-member districts (SMDs) and about two-thirds by proportional representation.
It is possible that M5S and the centre-left, opposition Partito Democratico (PD), which has reclaimed its place as the second most popular party, surpassing M5S with a vote share of 23% at the European Parliament contest, will align in the event of a government crisis in order to avert an election over the near term that returns a right-wing government. However, the parliamentary maths would be difficult, particularly in the Senate (the upper house of parliament), and the two parties would struggle to justify such a move to their respective electorates.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
We expect Italy to remain a member of the EU and the euro zone during the 2019-23 forecast period. Other foreign policy mainstays-including a close relationship with the US and membership of NATO and the UN-will also stay in place. However, relations are likely to be strained. Mr Salvini has signalled a more confrontational stance towards other EU countries, taking a tough line on migration measures proposed at the European Council in June 2018. He has also protested against EU fiscal constraints and has already begun to posture with respect to Italy's plans for its 2020 budget.
Sino-Italian diplomatic relations will improve in the near term, following Italy's decision to sign in late March a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. The MoU is unlikely to increase bilateral trade or investment flows significantly in 2019-23, but it will probably undermine EU attempts to find a common stance on China and complicate Italy's relations with other EU countries and the US.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The M5S-Lega administration has departed from the more orthodox policies of previous governments. With regard to the labour market, the administration passed the so-called Dignity Decree in July 2018, reversing parts of the 2015 Jobs Act, a liberalising labour market reform. In April 2019 the government implemented an expansionary pension reform, easing the conditions for early retirement.
One of the administration's other flagship policies, M5S's citizenship income, provides a monthly stipend or top-up of other benefits to EUR780 for poor pensioners and the unemployed. For working-age people, the citizenship income effectively functions like a means-tested jobseeker's allowance and has been paired with enhanced active labour market policies.
The government has also implemented a first step towards the Lega's promised 15% flat income tax, applying this rate to VAT-account holders earning up to EUR65,000 beginning in January 2019. Finally, the administration has also approved a new anti-corruption law, as well as a security decree containing a series of tougher policing and immigration measures, and a growth decree meant to jump-start business activity.
The coalition's anti-reformist rhetoric and its open resistance to EU fiscal rules have rattled the markets. The banking sector also remains weak and highly exposed to government debt, which totals EUR2.3trn. However, credit quality has improved rapidly in the past two years, owing to regulatory pressures from the European Central Bank (ECB) to reduce stocks of bad loans on banks' balance sheets, and the rescue and restructuring of several troubled lenders, including Carige, the country's tenth largest, and Monte dei Paschi di Siena, its third largest. The country's two systemically important entities, UniCredit and Intesa SanPaolo, are considerably healthier and more resilient to shocks.
Nonetheless, an abrupt uptick in market perceptions of political risk could still pose challenges to financial stability. During our forecast period (2019-223) we believe it unlikely that Italy will lose market access. However, owing to the sheer size of Italy's public debt stock and the fragility its banks, the economy would be too large to rescue without support from the ECB in the event of a large-scale crisis.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Following a budget shortfall of 2.1% of GDP in 2018, the government is currently targeting a deficit of 2.4% of GDP this year. Given weak nominal GDP growth and revenue prospects, and the distinct risk of higher outlays than expected, we believe that this objective is implausible and expect a budget shortfall of 2.9% of GDP in 2019. The 2020 budget process, which will begin with an update to the government's fiscal and economic projections in late September and the submission of a draft budgetary plan to the European Commission in mid-October, is likely to prove exceptionally difficult. The deficit is then expected to contract marginally, to 2.8% of GDP in 2020 and to an average of about 2.6% in 2021-23. Public debt, at 132.2% of GDP at end-2018, is expected to remain near this level for the next five years.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below; it also launched an asset-purchase programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn and came to an end in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the forecast period, as the ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening. Euro zone inflationary pressures remain low, and there are pronounced downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook. As a result, we believe that the ECB will be reluctant to lift its deposit rate until June 2020. An increase in the main refinancing rate should follow in December 2020. At its last meeting, on April 10th, the ECB signalled that it was considering introducing a tiered deposit system, under which a portion of deposits at the central bank would be exempted from the deposit rate, which is currently -0.4%. The ECB's recent communication aims to show that it can hold rates at record-low levels for longer, or even cut them further later this year if necessary. Policy tightening should proceed at a gradual pace from 2021. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
In full-year 2018 real GDP expanded by 0.7%, down from 1.8% in 2017. Momentum was weak going into 2019, dampened by domestic political and economic uncertainty, as well as global trade tensions. In January-March 2019 the economy expanded by a downwardly revised 0.1% (compared with the previous three months). This followed two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which resulted in a first-quarter contraction of 0.1% year on year. We expect that the economy will expand by a marginal 0.1% in full-year 2019, on the back of slower growth in private consumption and fixed investment, and less favourable external conditions. High-frequency indicators for the first half of 2019 paint a mixed picture, suggesting that the recovery from recession is fragile and could falter in the coming quarters.
Economic growth will remain subdued in 2020, at 0.4%. In that year the building effects of the US-led global trade dispute, and a business-cycle slowdown in the world's largest economy, will weigh on the external sector and dampen sentiment. Growth should then pick up to an average of about 1.1% per year in real terms in 2021-23 as domestic and global demand recovers.
The boost to real household disposable income from recent tax cuts has faded, with real private consumption-accounting for about 60% of GDP-growing only modestly, by 0.6% in full-year 2018. Consumer spending also weakened as a result of heightened volatility in financial markets in the final two quarters of 2018, which weighed on consumer confidence, and it may do the same in the second half of this year as political tensions within the government and with the EU institutions mount. We expect a stagnant labour market, modest wage growth and waning consumer confidence to continue to constrain household spending in 2019. After meagre expansions of 0.4% per year on average in 2019-20, we forecast that consumer spending will rise to 1.1% per year in 2021-23 as domestic sentiment improves.
Public consumption rose by 0.2% in 2018, and we expect looser spending controls and limited fiscal stimulus efforts to result in a slight uptick in 2019-23. It will remain modest, however, at an annual average rate of 0.5% throughout this period. The current administration's looser stance towards deficit spending will raise the risk of higher levels of government consumption.
Fixed investment expanded for the fourth consecutive year in 2018, but was still more than one-fifth below its 2007 pre-crisis level. It rose by 3.2% in real terms last year, driven by transport equipment spending in the first half of the year, as well as a slow recovery in construction. In 2019-20 investment growth will slow significantly, to an annual average of 1.2%, held back by the expiration of tax incentives, policy uncertainty and declining sentiment, as well as public capital spending constraints, still impaired credit channels and relatively high levels of corporate debt.
The pace of export growth decreased markedly in 2018, to 1.4%. Export growth is expected to remain weak in 2019-20, owing in particular to lower growth in EU markets and global trade tensions, before picking up thereafter. Anaemic domestic demand growth and external demand constraints will also constrain import growth to less than 2% in 2019-22, before stronger export performance and healthier domestic demand lead to firmer expansion in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2018, at 1.2%, as a 0.2% decline in core inflation (headline inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices) more than offset inflationary pressures coming from a 30.7% increase in international oil prices and a rise in global food prices for the first time in seven years.
In 2019 consumer price growth should slow further, to 0.9%, owing to cheaper average global energy prices and still considerable slack in the labour market, meaning that upward pressure on prices from capacity constraints will not materialise in the near term. A positive demand shock from fiscal policy-for instance, as a result of the government's means-tested citizenship income or its expansionary pension reform-also looks unlikely. In 2020 headline inflation should increase slightly, driven by a forecast 4.8% increase in global food prices, which will offset downward pressures coming from declining global energy prices. From 2020 inflation should recover gradually, to average 1.4% in 2021-23 as global energy prices pick up.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of quantitative easing tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:EUR1-US$1.14:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators have continued to disappoint market expectations and point to a weaker euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable throughout the year, reflecting investors' concerns about Brexit and a further deterioration in US-EU trade relations. After averaging US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019, the euro should pick up more substantially in 2020, to US$1.18:EUR1, as these risks abate, momentum in the euro zone recovers and the ECB takes steps to tighten policy. The currency will rebound further in 2021-23, to US$1.23:EUR1, underpinned by the euro zone's large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
In 2018 the current account remained firmly in surplus, at 2.4% of GDP. We expect it to average 1.5% in 2019-23. This decline reflects considerably slower growth in export revenue until 2021, in line with slower global demand. Higher international energy prices in 2021-23 will have a negative effect on the trade balance in those years (Italy is a major energy importer).

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
After being badly defeated in the European Parliament and local elections on May 26th 2019, the ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has called a pre-term general election-scheduled to be held on July 7th. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the main opposition party, the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, will win the election and could secure a clear parliamentary majority without the need for the support of another party.
We expect the next government to face formidable challenges: ND has pledged, if elected, to renegotiate the Macedonia name-change deal, and the Syriza government will leave to its successor the task of correcting fiscal slippage-having loosened fiscal policy in the run-up to the May 26th elections-and of reversing backsliding on structural reforms. Failure to make progress could lead to renewed tensions with Greece's EU creditors.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality in the medium term, until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's international creditors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, it will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
After expanding by 1.9% in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to reach 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and an annual average of 2% in 2021-23. Meeting large primary budget surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove to be difficult. Public debt is forecast to be still high, at about 175% of GDP in 2023.
Inflation (EU harmonised) will remain subdued, rising slightly-from 0.8% in 2018 to 1.1% in 2019 and 2020-reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and weaker global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to rise, bringing inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect narrow current-account deficits in 2019-23 (the forecast period), compared with an annual average of 7.1% of GDP since 2001.

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period, with progress in almost all categories, apart from political stability. However, Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions, which will constrain real GDP growth and keep Greece's debt burden high.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 debt crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% (29% in 2018) and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to an estimated 2.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
At the European Parliament, regional and municipal elections on May 26th 2019 the ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the main opposition party, the centre-right New Democracy (ND). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the resulting pre-term general election, scheduled to be held on July 7th, will result in a win for ND and a change of government.
Since early January 2019 Mr Tsipras's government has not had a stable majority in parliament, following the withdrawal of the small, right-wing, nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the ruling coalition in protest to the government's agreement with Macedonia to change that country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. In August 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme, signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. During his time in power, since 2015, Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and has failed to revive his party's political fortunes, despite loosening fiscal policy in the run-up to the May 26th elections.
Political instability has intensified ahead of the next general election owing to the Macedonia name-change deal, which is opposed by a majority of Greeks. This instability has deepened political polarisation in the country, hampered government effectiveness and weakened commitment to political and economic reform. We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise to much more than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, hindering the next government's ability to reduce Greece's public debt of more than 180% of GDP to a more sustainable level. The next government will also be left the task of correcting recent fiscal slippage and backsliding on some structural reforms, which could lead to renewed tensions with Greece's EU creditors.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
In the European Parliament elections, Syriza trailed ND, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, by about 9.5 percentage points, winning about 24% of the vote-in line with recent polls and more than 10 percentage points less than the party received in the September 2015 general election. We therefore continue to expect ND to win the general election on July 7th. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, this will be offset by widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, which has increased owing to the Macedonia name-change deal and divisions within Syriza. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Based on the result of the European Parliament elections, ND's chances of securing a clear majority in parliament without the support of another party have improved.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability, as well as protracted economic and financial crises, have limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans. Recent government efforts to restore influence on the international scene, including the Macedonia name-change deal and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. Ratification of the name-change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership, but the leader of ND has said that, if elected, his government would seek to renegotiate the deal.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey will persist. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Turkey's release in August 2018 of two Greek soldiers arrested in March of that year while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programme in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line. In June 2018 Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked for early repayment of a more expensive tranche of IMF debt-due to be completed in July 2019-and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover the country's financing needs to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
However, the government will still be subject to severe policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond, until its huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was about 182% of GDP at end-2018, and also predominantly owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance will be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries.
The implementation of further debt-relief measures also agreed with Greece's EU creditors in June 2018 will be conditional on quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments, the most pressing of which include tackling Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, reviving the government's privatisation programme, removing remaining capital controls and clearing state arrears to the private sector. Greece has also committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. As the quarterly reviews will be published (the most recent was released on February 27th 2019 and updated on April 4th), transgression by Greece could adversely affect market access. The debt-relief measures include a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). Greece will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2019-22.
In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing requirements, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. After a three-year absence Greece has tapped the financial markets five times since July 2017, most recently in early March 2019 with a well-subscribed ten-year issue, yielding 3.9%. The spread on the secondary market between Greek ten-year government bonds and equivalent German government bonds has narrowed steadily in recent months, but it remains large, at about 335 basis points in late May. Amid rising domestic political instability, as well as global economic and financial uncertainty, further bond issuance will be challenging.
In the medium and long term, the political and-arguably-the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past four years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
After almost a decade of austerity Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 1.1% of GDP and a primary surplus of close to 4.5% in 2018, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 3.5%. From 2019, however, we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits from 2020 and primary surpluses falling short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint ahead of the next general election and only moderate economic growth. There is also uncertainty about the application of the Council of State's ruling that previous pension and bonus cuts implemented in 2016 were unconstitutional, raising the risk of retroactive payments. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-18 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be about 175% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below. It also launched an asset-purchase programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn and came to an end in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the forecast period, as the ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening. Euro zone inflationary pressures remain low, and there are pronounced downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook. As a result, we believe that the ECB will be reluctant to lift its deposit rate until June 2020. An increase in the main refinancing rate should follow in December 2020. At its last meeting, on April 10th 2019, the ECB signalled that it was considering introducing a tiered deposit system, under which a portion of deposits at the central bank would be exempted from the deposit rate, which is currently -0.4%. The ECB's recent communication aims to show that it can hold rates at record-low levels for longer, or even cut them further later this year if necessary. Policy tightening should proceed at a gradual pace from 2021. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The Greek economy is recovering from a protracted slump, but the recovery is modest and vulnerable to domestic, and external, developments. As at 2018 real GDP was still more than 25% less than pre-crisis levels; meanwhile government consumption remained almost a quarter lower, household consumption one-fifth lower and gross fixed investment almost two-thirds lower. Real GDP accelerated from 1.4% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final three months of last year, contracting by 0.1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained, at 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and at an annual average of about 2% in 2021-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
A combination of more-and higher-taxes, larger social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts will continue to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2019-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 12% year on year in 2018. We expect a pick-up from this year, to an annual average of 5.2% in 2019-23. Underinvestment during the economic crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively small, uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.5% in 2019-23, down from 8.8% in 2018. However, the Greek tourism sector faces considerable challenges, including the UK's planned departure from the EU, increased competition from Turkey and insufficient public investment.
How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country remains in the euro zone. Although the risk of Grexit has abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and sharp decreases in global oil prices in the final quarter of 2018 will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect inflation to rise modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 1.1% per year in 2019-20 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of quantitative easing tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:EUR1-US$1.14:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weaker euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to remain broadly stable throughout the year, reflecting investors' concerns about Brexit and a further deterioration in US-EU trade relations. After averaging US$1.13:EUR1 in 2019, the euro should pick up more substantially in 2020, to US$1.18:EUR1, as these risks abate, momentum in the euro zone recovers and the ECB takes steps to tighten policy. The currency will rebound further in 2021-23, to an average of US$1.23:EUR, underpinned by the euro zone's large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but also partly because of improved competitiveness, particularly in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2019-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. [...]a deterioration in relations could jeopardise Turkey's control of territory across the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019c 2020c 2021c 2022c 2023c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 28.8 29.7 30.5 31.6 32.2 33.1 33.9 34.5 35.0 35.5 Labour force (% change) 6.4 3.1 3.0 3.6 1.9 2.7 2.3 1.8 1.5 1.3 Employment (m) 25.9 26.6 27.2 28.2 28.7 28.4 29.4 30.2 30.9 31.7 Employment (% change) 5.4 2.7 2.2 3.6 1.9 -1.0 3.5 2.5 2.5 2.4 Unemployment (m) 2.9 3.0 3.3 3.5 3.5 4.7 4.4 4.3 4.1 3.8 Unemployment rate (%) 10.0 10.3 10.9 10.9 10.9 14.1 13.1 12.5 11.7 10.7 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 8.8 7.7 7.8 11.1 16.3a 16.1 10.2 7.5 7.3 6.9 Consumer prices (year-end)d 8.2 8.8 8.4 11.8 20.2a 12.5 8.8 7.4 7.1 6.8 Producer prices (av) 10.2 5.3 4.3 15.8 27.0a 21.4 11.3 8.4 8.3 7.5 GDP deflator (av) 7.4 7.8 8.0 10.8 16.0a 16.0 7.9 6.5 6.2 5.9 Private consumption deflator (av) 7.7 7.8 6.6 10.8 14.7a 17.3 9.1 7.5 7.3 6.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 9.4 8.4 8.9 10.7 14.2a 15.2 9.2 7.0 6.4 5.9 Fixed investment deflator (av) 9.0 7.6 7.6 13.0 19.6a 14.0 6.0 5.0 4.5 4.0 Average nominal wages 15.5b 18.5b 20.6b 13.2b 14.5 16.0 12.0 11.0 10.5 10.0 Average real wages 6.1b 10.1b 11.9b 1.9b -1.6 -0.1 1.6 3.3 2.9 2.9 Unit labour costs (TL-based; av)e 18.2b 17.3b 21.9b 11.8b 16.0 19.3 13.9 12.6 11.8 11.1 Unit labour costs (US$-based)e 2.8b -5.6b 9.8b -7.5b -12.4 0.8 13.8 9.2 8.9 6.7 Labour costs per hour (TL)e 11.0b 13.1b 15.8b 17.9b 20.4 23.7 26.6 29.5 32.6 35.8 Labour costs per hour (US$) 5.0b 4.8b 5.2b 4.9b 4.2 4.1 4.6 5.0 5.4 5.7 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Seasonally adjusted. e Manufacturing only: public and private sectors.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond. The concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament suggest that policy will retain an element of unpredictability.
Domestic and regional political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic.
The currency crisis in 2018 pushed the Turkish economy into a recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to have continued in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a full-year real GDP contraction of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
The currency crisis and recession will put pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets. In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance sheet trends will persist). This, and a recovering economy, will cause the budget deficit to narrow, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% of GDP in 2023.
The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 81.9m in 2018 to 85.4m in 2023, with the female population continuing to far outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by 0.8% per year during the 2019-23 forecast period, compared with growth of 1.6% in the historical period (2014-18).
The large consumer market is one of Turkey's main attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local-currency terms. We expect GDP per head to rise from US$9,333 at market exchange rates in 2018 to about US$11,700 in 2023.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2019-23), and its global ranking falls by 11 places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, inadequate policy responses to tighter global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse in 2018-19. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced, but evasion remains widespread.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018-19. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Mismatches between education and labour market needs persist.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled US$175bn and imports about US$217bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$41.9bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$27.1bn (or 3.5% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair; opposition candidates received little or no media coverage, the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison, and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to win more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections took place on March 31st 2019. The AKP and the MHP retained a majority of the national vote. However, in the midst of an economic recession the ruling parties lost vital cities such as Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city. Losing major cities is a blow to the AKP given the public resources that the cities command. However, Mr Erdogan's tight grip on national institutions and the media means that he will continue to dominate Turkish politics in the coming years. In Istanbul a rerun of the election will be held on June 23rd after the Supreme Election Council (YSK) invalidated the results. Available polls point to another victory for Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). However, despite his apparent advantage, we expect that the AKP, having placed large pressure on the YSK to annul the vote, will do whatever is necessary and obtain a victory.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic, and transactional, rather than strategic. We do not expect a collapse in relations, but this forecast is highly uncertain. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup, US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups, Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran, and US sanctions on Turkish officials owing to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October 2018). In 2019 relations with the US will continue to be tested owing to Turkey's decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system. The US and NATO believe that the Russian-made S-400 system can gather sensitive information on NATO equipment and-in particular-the F-35 stealth fighter jet. The incompatibility of the S-400 with NATO systems is a further issue.
We believe that Turkey will not bow to US pressure, and will proceed with the delivery of the S-400 air defence missiles; Turkey considers this as a sovereign issue, and is keen to show that it does not concede to US demands. Backing down would also have a negative effect on Turkey's relations with Russia, a significant ally of neighbouring Syria. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. Thus, a deterioration in relations could jeopardise Turkey's control of territory across the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. It could also limit Turkey's influence in Idlib, a city in northern Syria, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups. In September 2018 Turkey, Russia and Iran reached an agreement to forestall a regime offensive against Idlib. Such an attack could result in another surge of refugee flows into Turkey.
The US will have to respond to what it considers as aggressive behaviour from Turkey, probably through sanctions on Turkish individuals. However, the US will stop short of imposing damaging sectoral sanctions on Turkey for fear of pushing the country towards Russia and Iran. Turkey's participation in the F-35 programme, and the planned delivery of 100 F-35 jets to Turkey, will be frozen to allow both sides to negotiate quietly. Both sides have an incentive to reach an agreement on the F-35 jets: Turkey's threatened exclusion from the F-35 project would delay the whole programme, and the cancellation of the delivery of 100 F-35 would represent a setback for Turkey.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business, and investment, climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector. We expect the currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession to put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets.
With the March 2019 local elections completed, the rerun of the Istanbul poll scheduled for June, and the next parliamentary and presidential elections not due until mid-2023, the government will soon be in a position to defuse domestic political tensions and take a more long-term approach to policymaking. This would help to revive investor confidence and foster sustainable economic growth, reversing the pattern of the past three years of ad hoc policy measures, which boosted the economy, but exacerbated Turkey's macroeconomic imbalances and diminished the government's credibility. However, an element of unpredictability and unorthodoxy will remain. The economy is in recession and-following its recent poor performance in local elections-the AKP will continue to feel under pressure to support growth. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in the 2019-23 forecast period.
Should the recent currency crisis trigger a banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia has tense relations. Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Only China appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey (perhaps as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Under the AKP, public finances have been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax increases in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits caused the budget deficit to widen in 2018, to 2% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance-sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% of GDP in 2019 to 1.7% in 2023.
The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.9% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), in the context of economic turmoil after the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to about 26.5% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as the record rise in annual consumer price inflation.
At its meeting on April 25th the MPC kept its one-week repo lending rate unchanged, at 24%. We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will lower gradually its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that the central bank will continue to overshoot its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2017 (from 3.3% in 2016), but this surge exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to continue in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a contraction in full-year real GDP of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 4.1% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.6% per year. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts: these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices drove inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of the appreciation of the lira in the second half of 2019, a lower average global oil price and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2018 will prevent inflation from declining faster than would otherwise be the case. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.1% in 2019-only marginally slower than the 2018 rate-slowing to 6.9% in 2023.
We expect inflation to decelerate rapidly in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 10.2% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of 2018. In the first months of 2019 the lira has again depreciated against the US dollar owing to political uncertainty and polarising campaign rhetoric around the March local elections, declining central bank foreign-exchange reserves, the re-emergence of tensions with the US and the rerun of the Istanbul mayoral race following the AKP's defeat.
The lira again surpassed TL6:US$1 in early May, and we expect a gradual appreciation from this level in the second half of the year and a year-end exchange rate of about TL:5.70:US$1. This forecast rests on our expectation that the Turkey-US dispute will not result in damaging sectoral sanctions, but-at most-only in individual sanctions, that government policy will be credibly reoriented and that the central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy stance, lowering interest rates only as price pressures fade. There are large risks to this forecast, both in terms of probability and impact. If any of our expectations do not materialise, the lira could again depreciate substantially.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to depreciate as the current-account deficit widens and as central banks in advanced economies re-embark on a path of monetary policy tightening. Thereafter still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although not as wide as in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to near TL6.4:US$1 by end-2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect the current-account deficit to narrow as a share of GDP in 2019, to 0.7% (a 16-year low), from 3.5% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2017, as the lira's depreciation against the US dollar and the euro depresses imports (owing to a decline in domestic demand) and boosts export competitiveness. From 2020 we expect the deficit to widen gradually, to a still relatively moderate 3.4% per year on average in 2020-23. The narrower deficits compared with historical levels reflect significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018-19 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Full text: Venezuela--highlights: Political outlook
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a transitional national unity government emerging this year. Reduced production capacity at the state oil firm, PDVSA, and the imposition of US sanctions amid the political crisis will put pressure on the patronage flows that support the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government, led by Nicolás Maduro, leading to cracks in the regime and opening the door to a transition government led by Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly (and self-declared interim president), and pragmatic members of the PSUV regime. However, such an administration and its successor would face considerable hurdles and substantial challenges to stability, as its attempts to correct the current severe macroeconomic distortions will affect entrenched interests. We expect the process to be chaotic and likely to feature several false starts. The possibilities of a prolonged period of chaos, an outright military dictatorship or a military-heavy government fronted by civilians remain potential outcomes.

Venezuela ranks as the least attractive location of the 82 countries covered in our rankings in 2019-23. Even though we anticipate a change of government early on in the forecast period, the depth of the economic crisis and years of deterioration across all areas of the investment climate will take time to address. Official policy will become slowly more welcoming to foreign investment, but until the economy stabilises, access to foreign exchange improves and institutions are overhauled, we do not expect fundamental improvements in the operating conditions for foreign businesses.

A combination of highly distortionary economic policies and subdued global oil prices will prolong Venezuela's recession in 2019-20. Large budget deficits-due to a narrow revenue base and dropping oil production-will continue to spur money printing, driving inflation. Oversupply of local currency, limited exports and foreign-exchange controls will fuel a black market for foreign currency despite continued devaluations of the official exchange rate. Our forecasts for 2021-23 are more positive, based on the benign assumption that substantial international financial assistance will help a pragmatist administration to stabilise the economy, but fiscal deficits will remain large (given the pressures of economic stabilisation) and the public debt burden will accelerate rapidly.

Amid the political and economic crisis, Venezuela's population has declined in recent years owing to outmigration, with some 3.7m Venezuelans estimated to have left since 2014; this has resulted in population growth declines in 2014-18. We forecast that only a small percentage of those who left will return, with population growth now occurring through natural growth. Given that many of the refugees and migrants will have been of working age, this will result in a higher old-age dependency ratio. This ratio will remain low by developed-country standards, but population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system in a context of volatile public finances.

Years of economic crisis and hyperinflation have decimated the Venezuelan economy; in real terms it is now almost 60% smaller than it was in 2013. Our forecasts for recovery do not envision any rapid recovery under the subsequent government. The economic crisis and falling real incomes will continue to restrict purchasing power. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, extremely challenging conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

Assuming a political transition in 2019 that will lift economic distortions and improve the business environment, we expect that Venezuela's economy will begin to recover. But the damage inflicted on the economy in recent years will prove difficult to reverse. As such, recovery will be gradual, with GDP growth averaging just 0.1% annually in 2019-30. In 2031-50 we forecast that Venezuela's real GDP growth will pick up to 3.7% as rising investment in human capital boosts labour productivity growth, helping to offset deteriorating demographics. Persistent oil dependency will be difficult to undo, and a weak productive base will limit overall economic output.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity quickly plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression. Mr Maduro won re-election in May 2018 in an election that was neither free nor fair; the leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president in January as a result.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$22.3bn in 2018 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 4.1% of GDP that year

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006, has been in power since 1999. The populist-nationalist PSUV was initially ruled by the late president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Since Mr Chavez's death, the party has been led by Nicolás Maduro. Over most of its tenure, the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested power, initially owing to Mr Chavez's immense popularity, and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. The opposition is diverse, and contested the 2015 election as part of the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) coalition, winning a majority in the National Assembly (although the group's largest party, Acción Democrático, left the coalition in July 2018). However, following the opposition win, the government made the National Assembly essentially powerless, and convened a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) that has granted itself remit over all legislative matters. The politicised Supreme Court and the executive have recognised the ANC, turning it into the country's de facto legislature and relegating the National Assembly.
Mr Maduro's controversial re-election in May 2018 was pronoucned illegitimate by the National Assembly, leading that body's president, Juan Guaidó, to declare himself interim president of the country in January 2019 (when Mr Maduro's disputed new term began). In this claim Mr Guaidó has been supported by 54 (mainly Western) countries, including most Latin American democracies. However, Mr Maduro remains in control of the military and most of the government apparatus. This has led to a stand-off between the two camps, which The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes will be resolved by the formation of a unity transitional government by Mr Guaidó and PSUV pragmatists later this year. Mr Maduro is extraordinarily unpopular-with approval of around 12% in May-and he relies on the support of the military to maintain power. For years the government has kept the military on side via a combination of purges and patronage. The latter has resulted in direct participation of the military in key government positions, and in a variety of opaque internal civic-military factions that coexist within the regime.

Political outlook: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Mr Maduro of the PSUV, is under severe economic and political pressure. We expect that a national unity government composed of opposition and regime "pragmatists" will form a transitional administration later in 2019. The transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
On April 30th the opposition-controlled National Assembly and interim president, Mr Guaidó, together with a limited number of soldiers, staged a military uprising against Mr Maduro. Since taking oath as interim president in January, Mr Guaidó initially re-energised a disillusioned population, which has allowed him to convoke massive demonstrations. The recent uprising broke a stalemate that had developed since February; however, the attempt was easily controlled by the regime's security forces. Although unable to wrest power from Mr Maduro, the uprising does not appear to have been fruitless, revealing further cracks among the regime's ranks-particularly in the Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional (SEBIN, the secret police). Lower-ranking members of the military continue (gradually) to defect from the regime owing to Mr Maduro's incapacity to maintain the system of patronage flows underpinning the regime's internal stability. Mr Guaidó continues to enjoy strong support from most Western nations and, at the time of writing, no arrest warrant had been issued against him, despite his leadership of the uprising, and his continuing calls for indefinite protests until Mr Maduro forfeits power.
Mr Guaidó is presenting his leadership as a path out of the current quagmire for dissatisfied regime members. He has repeatedly called for the military to depose Mr Maduro, offering the lifting of sanctions on oil trade conducted by PDVSA-the state-owned oil company (and of targeted individual sanctions for defectors); the arrival of international aid and financing; and amnesty for defectors. Overall, considering that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, which Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee, we expect that pragmatists within the regime will eventually marginalise or expel "hardliners" in exchange for influence in Mr Guaidó's more prosperous government.
A Guaidó-led transition government is our baseline forecast; however, such an administration would face considerable hurdles and it is unclear how much muscle the opposition would have in a power-sharing transitional government. If opposition figures cannot deliver on its promises quickly enough, the government could well collapse, given the challenging tasks ahead. These include securing debt relief; rebuilding the rule of law; and attracting tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment. Through all this, the opposition would need to be careful to avoid upsetting its partners. Most of the opposition's economic rationalisation plans require reforms that eliminate the economy's distortions, closing the avenues for corruption and enrichment that regime members have used for years.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. Firstly, that regime pragmatists will have enough capacity to overpower hardliners. Secondly, that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a unity government is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this forecast come in the form of greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities that could be providing the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
Given the very high risks to our baseline view, there are several alternative scenarios, with varying probabilities. Our main alternative scenarios are the following (in order of likelihood): firstly, a continuation of the PSUV's authoritarian rule (with or without Mr Maduro). Secondly, a complete collapse of the regime followed by an opposition-led government. Lastly, prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict-if divisions within the regime become clearer but no faction gains outright control of the state apparatus.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Despite our forecast for a political transition to begin this year, resulting in a national unity government, Venezuela in 2019-23 will continue to suffer from one of the weakest political and institutional frameworks in the region. Two decades of rule by the PSUV has engendered low institutional effectiveness and high levels of corruption largely due to the centralisation of power within the executive branch. Even under a new administration, there will continue to be questions around the credibility of the country's institutions, and a lack of accountability and transparency. Given the nature of power-sharing inherent under the scenario of a unity government, there is likely to be little progress in addressing these shortcomings owing to the vested interests that would need to be dismantled to achieve effective reform. For example, massive corruption and clientelism in the provision of subsidised goods and utilities would be hard to eliminate without upsetting regime insiders and risking political stability. Similarly, PDVSA will be a crucial part of this process. The company is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders, but mismanagement and corruption there will need to be curtailed to a minimum to stabilise both the company and the country's macroeconomy. Foreign investment will need to be secured to lift output, but this will require a wholesale reform of the oil sector's institutional framework. This is itself an endeavour that will require considerable political capital, which will probably be in short supply. The new government will also be constrained by public demands to punish corruption in the previous administration, balanced against the practical need to keep PSUV regime members and bureaucrats onside.
The political transition could similarly exacerbate existing problems, such as violent crime, which is currently fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement. It could be aggravated by the disbanding of colectivos (armed pro-PSUV civilian groups), which will continue to operate as armed gangs under a future government. Drug-trafficking will remain a worrisome issue, with criminal networks well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Furthermore, the homicide rate has risen sharply over the past 15 years. According to official figures, Venezuela recorded a homicide rate of 58 per 100,000 people in 2015, although private sources claim that the rate was much higher. Subsequent measurements by a well-regarded local think-tank, the Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia, put the national murder rate in 2018 as high as 81.4 per 100,000, a slight reduction from 2017, but still the highest regionally and among the highest in the world. Aside from homicides, there have been numerous high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas, a development that has increased concern over police corruption and mismanagement. This increase in criminality will not be halted unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, reduce rates of impunity, and boost youth employment.
Political outlook: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. As we currently expect such a government to coalesce within 2019, we expect elections at some point in 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming. The task will be huge, as deep reforms to the electoral authority, to the electoral registry, and to the voting system will be required, and rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult.
Political outlook: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised Mr Guaidó. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative lacks international legitimacy. However, the US administration has sunk considerable political capital into Mr Guaidó, and the possibility of smaller-scale interventions, such as targeted bombings, cannot be discounted, especially given that the US no longer has substantial economic sanctions to throw at the regime.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in terms of investment. Russia recently sent a limited number of military personnel to the capital, Caracas, which will further antagonise its relations with the US. Nevertheless, we believe that both Russia and China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt to protect their current investments in Venezuela.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings place Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations during the historical period (2014-18). The country deteriorates further during the 2019-23 forecast period, standing as the worst place to do business in the 82 countries covered by our rankings.
The poor score reflects a combination of political conflict, an erosion of the legal framework for investors and a state-led model that hampers private enterprise and competition. Highly distortionary macroeconomic policy measures have created critical economic problems that have paralysed the investment climate, most noticeably through extreme difficulties in purchasing foreign exchange and remitting profits. The associated problem of a runaway black-market exchange rate, combined with the government's highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policy stance, has generated hyperinflation.
The severe macroeconomic crisis poses a challenge for business because it has fundamentally altered income patterns and Venezuelans' purchasing power, and destroyed virtually all of the country's non-oil manufacturing capacity. The government has backed itself into a corner with relation to macroeconomic management with the result that policy in other areas is largely driven by economic constraints. This explains why we expect the business environment to remain extremely weak in 2019-23 even though we anticipate a change of government early on in that forecast period. The policy line under a new government is likely to be much more welcoming towards the private sector, but until the underlying macroeconomic situation stabilises, institutions strengthen, and there is better access to foreign exchange and fewer problems with basic power and water supply, foreign investors will remain wary.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Large-scale emigration of skilled labour complicates hiring.
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid means that rationing and unpredictable blackouts continue. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

The macroeconomic environment will remain weak
During the forecast period, Venezuela's macroeconomic environment will rank as the least attractive of all 82 countries covered in our rankings. The economy has contracted sharply for five consecutive years, with estimated real GDP having contracted by almost 60% since 2013. Oil production has fallen steadily from around 2.5m barrels per day (b/d) in the mid-2010s to an average of 1.4m b/d in 2018, with further sharp falls to under 1m b/d in early 2019. This reflects a combination of long-running under-investment in the state oil firm, PDVSA, little private investment and-more recently-the impact of US oil sanctions and domestic nationwide power cuts. Price controls remain in place, but have failed to stop hyperinflation taking hold. Deep-seated corruption has aggravated chronic shortages of US dollars, with the government in default on much of its public debt stock.
Later in 2019 we expect that US oil sanctions will accelerate the collapse in oil production (which ultimately funds the patronage system that is keeping the Nicolás Maduro regime in power); this is expected to lead to an internal fracture and change of administration, which we currently believe is most likely to take the form of a pragmatic but uneasy alliance between various current government and opposition members. This administration will, out of necessity, seek substantial foreign aid and investment to help to return the economy to sustainable growth. With the help of this funding, a moderate improvement in the quality of macroeconomic policymaking will take place. However, political instability, the depth of economic distortions and the need to overhaul considerable portions of current regulations mean that changes will be slow. In addition, the government will face significant challenges such as a restructuring of defaulted and non-defaulted debt. Changes will take time to filter through to actual economic performance, explaining why Venezuela's macroeconomic ranking remains weak in 2019-23 even under a new administration.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will remain unaltered in 2019-23 and Venezuela's ranking in this category will place it among the least business-friendly of the 82 countries assessed in the business environment rankings. In spite of our expectation of a new government later in 2019, we expect little immediate improvement in the overall stance towards private enterprise. Most of the restrictive policies enacted against private enterprise can be traced back to government partialism to either entrenched economic elites or the public. Given our expectation of limited political stability even under a successor administration, a reversal of current de facto and de jure restrictions is unlikely, as any future administration will need to retain support during what is likely to be a destabilising political and economic adjustment period.
Operating conditions have long been challenging, but the current government will refuse to alter its stance-characterised by bias against free markets, weak, politicised and inefficient institutions, and widespread price-fixing-despite the scale of the ongoing economic crisis. Uncertainty over contract and property rights, distortionary price and exchange controls, and the cumbersome burden of government regulation will continue to restrict businesses' freedom to compete under Mr Maduro.
Under Mr Maduro, there have been fewer takeovers of private companies compared with his predecessor, reflecting deteriorating performance in nationalised firms, as well as a lack of funds to pay for compensation of nationalised assets. However, the threat of state interference remains high, particularly in industries with access to foreign exchange, as the government has tended to use accusations of black-market transactions as a pretext for uncompensated state intervention. The government began a 90-day intervention in Venezuela's largest bank, Banesco, in May 2018, ostensibly to curb black-market foreign-exchange transactions. The intervention was subsequently extended and only ended in March 2019 without any further action, but the risk of state intervention in the economy remains elevated. Raids, fines and confiscations on retailers violating maximum prices are a common occurrence and will continue in the short term.
Our expectation of little improvement in 2019-23 reflects the complex legal framework that sustains the current economic distortions, and the political and economic instability that is expected to reign in the country in the forecast period.
In the context of the institutional decay that has occurred in recent years, improving competition policy (as well as restricting lobbying and corruption) will require an overhaul of regulatory bodies and legal frameworks that is likely to take several years.

Policy under a successor government is likely to be much friendlier for investors
Venezuela's score and global ranking for policy towards foreign investment improves slightly between the historical and forecast period, reflecting anticipated changes in policy stance under our forecast unity government. However, the score will remain low and Venezuela will continue to rank poorly by both global and regional comparison. We expect the next government to take a friendlier approach towards foreign investment in the hopes of inciting investors to rebuild the decimated domestic productive capacity. The improvement in the score and ranking therefore reflects our expectation that the risk of nationalisation and/or expropriation will be lower under the next government.
The fact that the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is currently considering 18 cases lodged by companies affected by government nationalisation will deter foreign investment, particularly as there is little indication that the Maduro regime has either the desire or the funds to make compensation payments. Indeed, close to 30 cases have already been ruled on by the ICSID, but the government has only agreed payment plans on a limited number of these cases, and only under threat of seizures in foreign courts. Although we expect the next administration to demonstrate greater commitment towards abiding by international arbitration rulings, the authorities will encounter the same financial constraints facing the current regime.
We expect the next government to focus its efforts in attracting investment into the oil sector given its importance to the country's economic health. Even under the Maduro administration, PDVSA has partnered with private companies, with the majority of joint ventures being related to production or refining of extra-heavy oil from the Orinoco belt. Official data is not available but estimates on production suggest that it is these joint ventures that have kept production from collapsing further as output in operations fully controlled by PDVSA has plummeted. Under the new government, these efforts will be expanded. This will almost certainly require a reform of the current legal framework, which caps foreign participation in joint ventures at 40%. However, this will require considerable political capital and, as such, more aggressive measures (such as partly privatising PDVSA or the elimination of the requirement that PDVSA be involved in all oil projects) will be difficult to see through.

Easing currency controls will prove difficult and will progress only slowly
We expect a slight improvement in conditions in this category, leading to a small improvement in Venezuela's global ranking. Although official policy towards foreign investors will improve under a new government later in the forecast period, easing capital controls will prove extremely challenging, with the process likely to be gradual. Even by the end of the forecast period, access to foreign currency is likely to be restricted, hampering foreign trade.
In May 2019 the government loosened stringent currency controls that had been in place since 2003, permitting financial institutions to carry out the purchase and sale of foreign currency by individuals and businesses. The central bank will set the exchange rate based on the average exchange rate reported by banks the previous day. This is an acknowledgement that the central bank has exhausted its supply of liquid currency reserves and that the black-market exchange rate is the de facto official rate (the foreign-exchange market has traditionally suffered a large divergence between the official and black-market rates given that demand for dollars far outstrips supply). Although the removal of controls eliminates the government's role in the exchange market, it is unclear how the private sector will access dollars given that much of the country's export capacity remains in government hands. It is also unclear if the policy will last, or if the government will re-assert controls after a period of time. Given the depth of distortions, it is likely that the next administration will be forced to adopt a new domestic currency, which will most likely be pegged to the US dollar.
Difficulty in remitting profits earned in Venezuela will remain one of the most significant challenges of doing business for foreign companies operating in the country. Capital controls mean that official permission is required to remit profits, but with critical shortages of foreign exchange, remittances face long delays. Many foreign-owned companies have not been able to remit their profits for many years. With the Dicom rate (the rate offered by the government exchange authority) depreciating at such a rapid pace, the waitlisted profit remittances have seen their US- dollar value eroded significantly.
Bilateral trade partners will continue to struggle in their relations with the Maduro regime. Restricting foreign exchange to the private sector has resulted in a plummeting of imports. Outside of exchange controls, red tape, corruption and inefficiency also hinder trade, and corruption in the customs service will remain endemic. The acute foreign-exchange shortage has meant that even public-sector imports have been severely cut back, while the government has racked up significant debt to suppliers through unpaid bills. This is likely to change gradually under a successor administration, assuming that currency reform, large-scale aid inflows, a restructuring of debt obligations and a slow return of investment results in an increase in US dollar funds available to fund imports. However, the pace of these improvements will largely depend on how successful the new government is at restoring international credit and turning PDVSA around. Overall, we expect limited progress, as shown by the relatively low increase in Venezuela's score and ranking in this area.

Improvements in the tax regime are likely under an opposition government
The tax regime will remain a barrier to investment, with fiscal constraints prohibiting any significant improvements even under a new government. Rates of direct corporate taxation are currently moderate, with a top corporate income tax rate of 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), but tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. A series of new taxes introduced in 2009 in many cases doubled the effective tax rate on earnings. These taxes formed part of wider reforms such as a sports law, a new science and technology law, a worker training law, and a municipal law, but included new fiscal charges on businesses, some of which are levied on gross revenue rather than net earnings. The new government may reverse some of these measures, but more pressing need for a consolidation of the public finances will severely limit the scope for tax cuts.
It is difficult to assess exactly how narrow the tax base is currently: according to the latest official data disclosed by Venezuela's tax authority (Seniat), tax income accounted for just 12% of GDP in 2012. The Seniat regularly reports massive increases in tax collection, but with hyperinflation, tax collection is actually shrinking in real terms, implying that the tax base has shrunk even further in recent years.
Despite the deterioration in the public finances, we do not believe that tax rises are likely under the current administration. Mr Maduro has shown little interest in raising revenue to offset massive increases in public spending and appears content with financing the huge fiscal deficit through public debt issuance, which is monetised, driving hyperinflation. Based on our assumption that a new government will take office and begin enacting policy adjustments, we expect that efforts will be focused-at least initially-on improving compliance; a difficult task, given the deterioration of state institutions over the course of the past 15 years.

Financing conditions will remain difficult
Venezuela's score for financing deteriorates further in the forecast period, given the weak state of the banking sector and on the assumption that improvements in access to medium-term finance for the private sector, and eliminating distortions in the financial sector, will only occur towards the end of forecast period. In the short term, the government will continue its policy of directed lending, which requires private banks to channel credit to specific sectors at preferential rates (including agriculture, mortgages and tourism).
In nominal terms, bank credit has soared in recent years, but massive currency devaluation means that in real terms, credit has fallen sharply. For companies borrowing from local banks, credit remains predominantly short term. As only a small percentage of the population has sufficient funds to purchase investment and savings products, the capital market also remains shallow. Following a political transition, we expect interest rates to be gradually rationalised, but sector-specific measures will also be required and financing will remain a major weakness of the business environment throughout the forecast period given that the deposit base will remain very low until the economy is on a significantly stronger footing (unlikely within our 2019-23 forecast horizon).
The soundness of the financial system and the quality of regulation will remain key concerns, even after an expected change of government. Legislative changes in recent years have not resulted in a tighter regulatory framework, but have simply established new layers of bureaucracy. There has been no concerted effort to tackle the patchy enforcement of existing regulations. Weak skills in regulatory agencies and political meddling in oversight decision-making will remain problems and will continue to undermine efforts to identify and support ailing banks at an early stage. Improving the quality of financial-sector regulation is unlikely to be achieved in the short term, and even under a new administration, it would take time to rationalise the bureaucracy.
A removal of the many price, export, capital and foreign-exchange controls after an expected political transition would be risky for the stability of the financial system. For instance, normalisation of interest rates would almost surely have an adverse effect on loan performance and credit creation. Careful co-ordination with the country's banks to reduce pressures on the financial system will be required. The gradual lifting of the directed lending system would also allow for better allocation of resources and the medium-term stabilisation of interest rates.

Recent large-scale emigration will hamper the labour market in 2019-23
Venezuela's labour market is forecast to deteriorate further in 2019-23 owing to higher costs of labour in the forecast period (after an exchange-rate adjustment removes the distortionary effect of hyperinflation on the dollar value of wages), as well as the quality of the labour force being affected by the outmigration of much skilled labour. Even though we assume that a new government will begin to take steps to ease the highly regulated labour market, the legacy of large-scale emigration in recent years will have significant implications on the quality of the labour market in the coming years, as few of the skilled Venezuelans who have left the country are likely to return until the economy is on a much firmer footing (if at all). The highly distorted exchange-rate system makes it virtually impossible to assess wage costs in US dollar terms in comparison with the rest of the region. However, a 2012 labour reform increased non-wage costs considerably: obligatory non-wage costs, employers' social security contributions, mandatory profit sharing, and childcare and food allowances added more than 70% to the basic wage costs for large and medium-sized companies, and 30% for smaller companies.
The mass exodus of Venezuelans leaving the country will pose significant constraints on the labour market during 2019-23, particularly in terms of companies' ability to find skilled labour. An estimated 3.7m of Venezuelans-around 12% of the population-had fled the country as at end-2018, with the UN expecting this number to reach 5.4m by the end of 2019. Anecdotal evidence suggests that among those who have left, a large proportion is made up of middle-class professionals with good employment prospects abroad. Although some are more likely to return to the country under our assumption of regime change, this is unlikely to gather substantial pace during the 2019-23 forecast period, as many Venezuelans will wait until the political and economic situation stabilises before returning. This will worsen skill shortages in the meantime. This situation will be aggravated by the fact that chronic underinvestment in education in recent years means that even basic skills are scarce in much of the workforce, while political interference in universities and technical colleges has damaged the quality of the country's tertiary education system.
Wage and non-wage costs come on top of a long-standing firing freeze, under which staffing levels (excluding managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. Many workers cannot be fired at all, even in cases of stealing company property or failing to come to work. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements with workers; these typically centre on extremely generous severance payments, further adding to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers, a factor used by workers and union representatives to their advantage. Moreover, companies that make recourse to voluntary redundancies have at times been targeted for nationalisation, representing a further disincentive for the private sector.

Electricity provision will remain a critically weak area of infrastructure
Following years of mismanagement and underinvestment, Venezuela's infrastructure has fallen into critical disrepair and we only expect marginal improvements in 2019-23. Repeated pledges by the government to implement ambitious infrastructure projects have come to nothing, with state-led investment drying up entirely in recent years. Even routine maintenance has not been completed, with current prolonged power shortages and limited access to running water the most visible manifestation of this failure to sustain basic service provision. A post-transition government will be keen on making up the shortfalls, but progress will be limited owing to fiscal constraints and the difficulties in attracting long-term foreign direct investment into infrastructure. Some multilateral assistance will be forthcoming, which will help to tackle the most immediate problems of limited power and fresh water supply, but reversing the long-term underinvestment in other infrastructure areas will take many years.
Reliable access to electricity will be one of the most significant challenges for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2019-23. Although the country has long faced sporadic power outages, the situation has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Massive prolonged nationwide blackouts have hit the country, with the government requesting that workers remain at home while the authorities try to restore power. Some companies have opted to install backup generators, but this is a costly solution that does not solve all operational problems, as businesses find it difficult to find fuel and staffs face difficulties getting to work during blackouts. The supply of fresh water has been seriously affected, while communication, financial and transport networks have also been interrupted. Insufficient investment in maintaining the generation and transmission systems in recent years are to blame. Electricity tariffs have been kept extremely low, leading to rapid growth in demand. Water levels at the Guri dam-which generates most of the country's hydropower (which, in turn, accounts for over 50% of total electricity generation)-have recovered from critically low levels, but with recent damage to several transformers at the dam, power generation currently stands at less than half the total installed capacity of 24,000 MW. Our forecast assumes that a successor government would focus immediately on repairing damage to existing generators, in order to ease the risk of ongoing power cuts. However, overhauling the entire system will take years, meaning that electricity rationing and blackouts will remain a risk throughout the forecast period.
Government policies complicate air travel. Long delays in authorising the remittance of international air carriers' profits outs of Venezuela have prompted most international carriers to suspend services (most recently American Airlines, which in March suspended all direct services to the US). A subsequent ruling by the US Federal Aviation Administration on April 30th prohibiting US carriers from flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace will be a further constraint going forward. The reduced service, coupled with firm demand (as Venezuelans have sought to travel overseas to bring US dollars back into the country, where they can sell them on the black market), has sent airfare prices soaring. Moving freight through the country's ports, which are under military control, has also proven complex; reports of corruption are common.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Venezuela is not well prepared for technological disruption
As in all other categories of the business environment rankings, Venezuela ranks extremely poorly at both the regional and global level. In 2019-23 the score drops further, on the expectation that the next administration will concentrate on stabilising the economy rather than modernising technology provision and digitalising services. The economic crisis has taken its toll on the telecommunications sector, with falls in disposable income leading to a decline in mobile phone penetration since 2013. Internet penetration peaked in 2015 but has since fallen and is now among the lowest in the region. Given that these areas are critical to driving broader technological developments, including mobile apps and cloud computing, Venezuela's slippage in these areas are important factors explaining the country's weak score. Regulation and governance also remain relative weak points, while the long-running economic crisis has deterred private investment, which in turn has hampered research and development and the number of patent applications.
Price and tariff regulations affect the quality of technological infrastructure in Venezuela, because high consumption levels are not matched by capital expenditure. Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills, and massive "brain drain" also limit Venezuela's technological readiness. Moreover, acute skills shortages in technology will not be resolved in the short term, and private investors will wait for the political and economic situation to stabilise before making substantial capital expenditure commitments.
Although the Maduro administration, like the Chávez government before it, sought to direct state investment towards a variety of high-tech sectors, resources have been allocated inefficiently. For instance, the administration funded the construction of a factory to manufacture mobile telephones, but underinvested in the mobile network infrastructure, leading to poor service. Similarly, the government also built a factory to build educational computers, but school curriculums, educational materials and teaching standards have not been revised to train children in computer programming.
Internet and mobile network services are some of the cheapest in the world. However, lags in price adjustments make it difficult to cover the rising cost of maintaining the level and quality of the services. In addition, theft of equipment from companies' network infrastructure is common. As a result, service is unreliable and internet speeds are low compared with neighbouring countries.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The Economist Intelligence Unit's expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking, as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we foresee no fundamental change in policy by the Nicolás Maduro regime, which remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. Any efforts to tackle these issues have been self-defeating.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$42bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the ruling PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of any government will depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. PSUV hardliners could oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's control of the economy); however, we expect the government of Juan Guaidó, the interim president, to steer policymaking. That said, real investment inflows will be limited, owing to investors' caution over the credibility and stability of the new government, with the vast majority going into the oil industry, which will restrict economic recovery.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Government expenditure 34.1 32.5 53.9 68.1 85.8 44.0
Government revenue 18.6 24.0 24.4 24.5 24.6 24.6
Budget balance -15.5 -8.5 -29.5 -43.6 -61.2 -19.4
Government debt 96.4 120.2 68.5 104.4 151.6 148.2
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect that the fiscal deficit this year will be close to double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA, the state oil firm, and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. However, other investors have taken claims to the courts, and the results of these court battles will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining company, Crystallex, is seeking to collect an arbitration award by seizing shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. A ruling on the treatment of PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the government is pending, and will have implications for future debt restructuring. Following the imposition of sanctions on January 28th, the US government now considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but it is unclear how much power Mr Guaidó will have over the company. None the less, the risk of seizure of Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments, will remain high in the short term.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy
Interest rates
(%)
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 22.4 425.3 234.5 49.0 38.8 35.0
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 75% month on month in February. By end-January Venezuela had significantly raised reserve requirements for the banking sector, which "contained" hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise somewhat in the short term. But this is a one-off effect; hyperinflation and significant currency depreciation will return in May. We expect a new administration to place much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.

After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 18% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 60% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have further significantly damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 900,000 barrels/day (b/d) over the coming quarters, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. But until US sanctions on oil are lifted, margins will be smaller, as PDVSA has lost access to its closest and better-paying market. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2019-23) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Oil sector: With proven levels approaching 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The state is accorded exclusive ownership of PDVSA, the nationalised oil and gas firm, and its subsidiaries. Since 2007, oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%.
The latest PDVSA data put oil output at an average of 2.6m barrels/day (b/d) in 2016, while OPEC estimates put it at 2.2m, in line with data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). But in early 2019 Venezuela's oil output has fallen dramatically as nationwide blackouts and US sanctions have taken a further toll on a sector decimated by corruption, underinvestment and mismanagement. Latest IEA data estimate output at 870,000 b/d in March (down from 1.5m b/d in March 2018); the report notes that production likely fell lower in April. Official data is not available, but production estimates suggest that it is joint ventures with foreign investors that have kept output from dropping further. As the joint ventures deal predominately in heavy and extra-heavy oil, and as production of lighter oil is collapsing, PDVSA has been forced to import more diluents from abroad. This was complicated by the imposition of US sanctions in January, and the US government has been pressuring international firms to stop selling diluents to Venezuela as well. This is likely to put further pressure on PDVSA this year.
PDVSA's main joint-venture partners are Russian firms (Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft), CNPC (the Chinese state oil company), Chevron (US) and Eni (Italy). The government has shown a preference for Russian and Chinese firms, but even co-operation with these partners has reportedly been rocky at times given, among other things, pervasive corruption at PDVSA, complex regulatory and planning requirements, difficulties securing foreign exchange to afford production imports, and criminality in areas surrounding at oil production and refining facilities.
Dwindling production and a punishing debt redemption schedule have stretched PDVSA's financing to its limits. Suppliers and oil services firms have denounced delays in payments. Schlumberger, a US-based oil services firm, reportedly scaled back operations in Venezuela in 2016 and in 2017 wrote off at least part of PDVSA's debts. PDVSA has also fallen behind on its external debt obligations, with a majority of its almost US$30bn in outstanding external bonded debt accumulating arrears. One of the bonds that PDVSA remains current on, which matures in 2020, has 50% of Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary, as collateral. The opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to pay bondholders the US$71m interest payment in May to avoid Citgo's seizure. Another 50% of Citgo is reported collateral on a loan extended by Rosneft. Citgo traditionally has been a vital part of PDVSA's operations, as it refines and commercialises Venezuelan oil in the US, historically PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Although US sanctions have complicated this, the hope is that Citgo will remain an important government asset in any future administration.
Given the challenges arising from PDVSA's financial difficulties and perennial mismanagement, as well as US sanctions, the current decline in output is irreversible for as long as the present regime remains in power. With PDVSA in debt arrears and unable to articulate a credible restructuring plan to creditors, we expect that a turnaround of the oil sector will only be possible after a new government is in office. We expect that any new government will prioritise the improved management of PDVSA and will attempt to open the company to increased co-operation with international investors (and perhaps even allow outright foreign operations in the country), a necessity given that PDVSA will be unable to afford the required investments. However, this will require a complete overhaul of the sector's current legal framework, which will require considerable political capital, and which remains uncertain.

Severely reduced domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but according to estimates from the opposition-led National Assembly monthly inflation was 18.1% in March. This was the lowest reading since May 2017; however, the current disinflationary trend is merely temporary and monthly inflation will jump over the coming months. In the context of a projected macroeconomic stabilisation plan later in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.

Under our current baseline forecast of a political transition later in 2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means by which to try to tackle hyperinflation is highly likely. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devalued the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. At end-April the official rate stood at BsS5,200:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of over BsS5,800:US$1.

We expect a small current-account surplus in 2019, buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data, on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been severely reduced and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus to a deficit of 4.1% of GDP in 2023.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic transition administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt-renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela
Stocks and flows
According to the IMF (whose figures differ somewhat from local sources), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$30.1bn in 2016, the last year in which actual data have been provided. This is around one-third less than a peak of US$48.9bn in 2007 and is primarily the result of significant disinvestment, notwithstanding the government's strict capital controls. Given the massive decline in GDP in recent years, this means that the FDI stock is estimated at 19.4% of GDP in 2018 (forecast to rise to 51.9% of GDP this year, as GDP contracts further). Overall, FDI inflows have been very volatile in the past 20 years, affected by both political and macroeconomic factors. During the oil opening of 1996-98, inward FDI peaked at an annual average of US$4.5bn a year. By historical standards, inward FDI held up well in the first three years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2003), averaging US$3.8bn per year in 1999-2001. As political conflict intensified, FDI inflows began to decline in 2002-08 (averaging US$1.8bn per year), and in 2009-a year of great volatility in the world economy and adverse domestic developments in Venezuela-the country registered disinvestment of US$1.1bn (some negative inflows were also the result of compensation for nationalisations). Inward FDI has recovered afterwards, averaging an estimated US$4.3bn per year in 2011-13, because of greater investment from China in energy and housing. It declined considerably afterwards, to US$1.9bn a year in 2014-16, likely as a reflection of both sliding international oil prices and foreign investors increasing disillusionment with the government's inability to comply with investment agreements and manage the economy. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable, reaching a stock of US$32.7bn in 2016. However, this tally is dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company.
Origin and distribution
The energy sector, and oil in particular, remains the main magnet for FDI. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even after forced changes to the ownership structure of most contracts. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). In recent years Venezuela has courted new investment partners in Brazil, China, Russia and Iran, with limited success. Domestic economic problems in most of these countries mean that short-term efforts will be focused on seeking investment from China and Russia.
Determinants
Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecommunications openings, an uncertain political and policy environment-including threats of nationalisation-and a volatile macroeconomic climate have served to keep FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, which mandates that PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector and levies high taxes and royalties on private partners. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt require substantial technical know-how and massive investment to be put to production, an environment where major oil companies would thrive. Many major companies are already present via joint ventures or were already present before nationalisation drives. Venezuela's oil sector will continue to be a major draw to FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies.
Impact
Foreign investment in oil brought accelerated growth in output, from 2.4m barrels/day (b/d) in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output, reinforced by PDVSA's inability to drive production. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing or services, but this in turn has resulted in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential
Given the scale of economic mismanagement and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and productive capacity, there is large potential for investment opportunities in Venezuela. Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example, leather goods, cocoa and rum). Further comparative attractions are Venezuela's transport infrastructure, which, despite lack of investment and maintenance, is still fairly good by regional standards, and the country's strategic geographic location. However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns over the current government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment and the fragility of the legal framework. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, insofar as the new government undertakes a commitment to improve the business environment, address corruption and exchange-rate distortions and controls local prices.

Population growth will resume under a new government, but will remain low
Population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate and -scale outmigration. The annual population growth rate has been steadily decreasing from 2.8% in the 1980s to 2.3% in the 1990s and 1.8% in 2000-10. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the population declined by 1% a year in 2014-18 as the economic crisis worsened. The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that some 3.7m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014. Our estimates for population growth in 2019-23 factor mainly natural increase, and we assume that only a small number of those who have migrated during the crisis will return, even as political and economic stability improves with the arrival of a new government. Still, the resumption of a more normal economic environment will lead to a return to growth in the participation rate and a faster growth rate in the labour force compared with that of the working-age population. The total population is expected to reach 28.9m by 2023 (from an estimated peak of 30.9m in 2016), with just over one-quarter of the population under the age of 14 and two-thirds of the population between 15 and 64 years of age. Population density is low, at 34 people/sq km as per official estimates from 2017. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with around 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure, limited job opportunities in the countryside and fixed agricultural prices (in many cases, below the cost of production) will result in a continuing trend of urbanisation in 2019-23, creating problems in the main cities.
The labour participation rate declined in 2004-12 (owing to an increased uptake of education linked to the government's social programmes), but ticked up marginally in 2013 and 2014, before falling again in 2015 as economic conditions worsened as job seekers became discouraged. The government has stopped producing labour data, but we expect that continued economic contraction and diminishing real wages (we estimate that, in real terms, the minimum wage plus food vouchers has lost some 95% of its value since mid-2013) has driven participation down further. Although we are forecasting some improvement later in the forecast period as the economic crisis is reversed, we expect the participation rate to remain below 70% until 2023. A very poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will continue to limit job creation, forcing more people to seek work in the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for around half of employment. According to the authorities, the official unemployment rate fell from 8.5% in 2010 to 6.8% in 2015. However, given that this coincided with a sharp deterioration in local economic conditions, it is likely that it reflects inflexible labour laws (which make it virtually impossible to lay off workers) rather than any significant job creation. It is also possible that the data are unreliable, as it is highly implausible that unemployment has remained low in the midst of a deep economic recession, with a growing number of companies folding.
Poverty indicators improved during the tenure of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but these data are no longer published by the authorities. Independent academic sources estimate that poverty rates have risen sharply in the context of collapsing economic activity and hyperinflation. A study by three well-regarded universities estimated the poverty rate at 87% in 2017. Shortages of medicines and surgical supplies are creating huge problems in the healthcare system, while insufficient vaccines are resulting in the re-emergence of diseases that had previously been practically eradicated.
Public services will remain under strain from a lack of resources
The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure, and lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. The latter are mainly imported, or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have fallen victim to a lack of US dollars. Hospital building and rebuilding programmes have been a failure, owing to mismanagement of funds and shortages of building materials. Even a parallel welfare system, the Sistema Nacional de Misiones, is struggling to function as the government makes cuts and inflation erodes purchasing power. Overall, the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services is therefore expected to deteriorate further. This will also reflect long-running problems including a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals, particularly doctors and nurses.

The scale of Venezuela's economic crisis has led to a rapid decline in living standards, with GDP per head falling almost by half from a peak of US$12,291 in 2012, to an estimated US$6,281 in 2018. Estimates using purchasing power parity (PPP) give a higher figure of US$11,698. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a further decline in both GDP per head at market exchange rates and PPP by 2023, despite our expectation for a change of government and more normal economic policy making, as economic growth is likely to remain low amid the severe imbalances left by the previous government.
Several factors will restrict purchasing power, including hyperinflation, and persistently high levels of poverty and income inequality. Although national statistics show a dramatic improvement in social indicators in recent years, the data have been disputed, and independent studies have suggested that inequality has not fallen as quickly as the government indicates, and that the middle-income class has shrunk. According to the UN Human Development Programme, 6.6% of the population survived on less than US$1.25/day (in purchasing-power terms) in 2012, a higher proportion than in almost any other country in the region.
Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition
Venezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location, although this will have to wait until a more market-friendly administration takes over from the ruling PSUV. The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions, relatively good physical infrastructure and a fairly favourable geographical location given its proximity to the US. However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and a deterioration of public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, continued high poverty levels and a deterioration in healthcare and education provision in the past three decades have contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, which has also been exacerbated by an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

A weakened productive base will sustain demand for imported goods
In common with the rest of the Latin American region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Sharp growth in mobile-telephone usage, and an underdeveloped urban public transport system and subsidised petrol (which have boosted car ownership) are the main factors behind the relatively heavy weighting of expenditure on transport and communications. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped, a legacy of "Dutch disease", whereby dependence on energy exports leads to currency appreciation and therefore a lack of competitiveness in manufacturing exports, with a consequent decline of the latter sector. Furthermore, shortages of foreign exchange have led to import controls, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically.
The scale of the country's ongoing recession will lead to major contraction in retail sales volumes throughout most of the forecast period, and only a modest improvement from 2022 as the economy normalises.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term outlook is based upon a transition to a new government (in 2019) that pursues sounder policies and improves the business environment. However, despite the prospects of a more market-friendly government and the gradual elimination of the country's economic distortions, long-term growth will remain underwhelming, and will continue to be subject to boom and bust cycles linked to the oil market. We therefore project that Venezuela's real GDP per head will contract by an average of 0.5% in 2018-30 (this figure is also influenced by major contractions in 2018-19, and a small contraction in 2020). Growth will average a healthier 3.7% in 2031-50 but the country's population is unlikely to reach a high standard of living within the forecast period. Indeed, by 2050 we forecast that per head GDP at purchasing power parity will be US$35,560-a low value for a country with Venezuela's endowment of national resources. Although we expect the business environment to improve, the country's weak institutions, dependency on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth.
Initial conditions: After averaging growth of 10% in 2004-08, real GDP fell sharply in 2009-10. Although the economy recovered in 2011-12 on the back of aggressive fiscal spending, growth slowed sharply again in 2013, with the economy slipping into a deepening recession in late 2014. We estimate that by the time the economy returns to growth in 2021, real GDP will have fallen by almost 60%, making the recession the country's most severe since compilation of national statistics data began. The heterodox policy framework that has been in place for over a decade has been a major factor in hampering GDP growth, while an opaque and distorted exchange-rate system has provided opportunities for corruption on a large scale, further undermining the institutional framework and maintaining income inequality. Given the sharp deterioration in conditions in recent years, there is potential for improvement in the policy and political environment in the long term under new administrations, but there is significant risk of an outright economic collapse before then (or afterwards, if the transition is particularly chaotic). In addition, institutional deterioration is very deep-rooted and will prove harder to reverse.
On a more positive note, a higher skills base and reasonably good infrastructure by regional standards provide scope for faster overall growth and a rise in personal incomes. Nevertheless, underinvestment in human capital and infrastructure, as well as the emigration of most skilled labour, is eroding these advantages and, given fiscal difficulties, this trend will take time to reverse. Successive governments have failed to take advantage of Venezuela's proximity to developed US and European markets relative to its South American neighbours, as internal geography and a lack of investment in infrastructure in the interior have limited Venezuela's chances of becoming a regional hub for transport and commerce.
Demographic trends: As in most other emerging-market countries, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, while rising participation rates will ensure that the labour force will grow at a brisker pace. Venezuela will continue to enjoy supportive population dynamics, with the dependency ratio of old to young low by comparison to OECD levels even in 2050. Even with life expectancy growing steadily, the share of the population aged 65 and over will be only around 16% in 2050 (although rising from an estimated 6.6% in 2017), while the proportion of the population at working age will remain high, at 65%. A particular risk to productivity is the "brain drain" seen in recent years as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad with no guarantee of returning, even after economic conditions stabilise following a change in government.
Diversifying away from oil will be one of the key long-term challenges
External conditions: Oil, which we estimate currently accounts for some 95% of export revenue, will continue to dominate the Venezuelan economy. However, there will be an effort to diversify the productive base in the long term, given the severe consequences of the economy's dependency on oil (particularly on the external and fiscal balances). During the Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and Nicolás Maduro eras Venezuela and its allies have taken a confrontational stance against US policy and US-led efforts at economic integration. This stance will soften once a new government is in power, which will result in an economic rapprochement with some of its faster growing neighbours, such as Colombia and Peru. It will also signal the end of programmes such as PetroCaribe, a scheme in which Venezuela provided subsidised oil to regional economies as a way of gaining international goodwill, which was financially viable only as a result of historically high oil prices. A gradual real devaluation of the exchange rate will be necessary for Venezuela to be competitive in non-commodity sectors, as will be the removal of state control over key productive sectors that have export potential. Capital control, trade restrictions and other barriers currently designed to keep foreign currency from leaking out will gradually be pared down as well, although further liberalisation of trade is unlikely to be a priority for the next government until well into the next decade. In the meantime, links with Asia will be strengthened, and the country's close relationship with China is not likely to be compromised, given that country's significant investment potential.
Institutions and policy trends: Under the assumption of a change in government that gradually ushers in improved policymaking over the long term, our long-term forecast assumes that there will be a gradual improvement to the policy environment. We assume that some of the most distortionary elements of the current policy framework, including price and exchange controls, will be scaled back gradually in the medium term, reducing the large black-market exchange-rate premium and increasing economic openness by the end of the long-term forecast period. However, the prospects for improvements in other aspects of the business environment are less encouraging, given that they will take far longer to address. For example, strengthening of the non-oil public finances will prove unfeasible until the economy is sufficiently diversified. Given that the economy will still be highly vulnerable to the fluctuations of the price of oil, the fiscal position will remain highly pro-cyclical. An overhaul of the overstaffed and inefficient bureaucracy will be difficult to achieve, even with an administration fully composed of the current opposition. This is owing both the political costs of redundancies, and the fact that many current opposition parties are ideologically inclined to have the state play a major role in the economy. Within the context of a deficient administrative framework, progress in reforming social security and labour legislation will be slow at best, as the new government will want to retain some of its powers of patronage in order to avoid a loss of support from the withdrawal of Chávez-era benefits. Endemic corruption and politicisation will be difficult to root out, even assuming other improvements in the policy environment.
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy are abandoned, the deterioration of the skills base over the past decade will mean that Venezuela's potential GDP growth will have been eroded, although there is still some scope for recovery in 2021-40, when growth will average a respectable 3.7%. It will then slow down to an average of 3.2% in 2041-50. A higher trend rate of GDP growth would be possible if a significant change in the policy direction is coupled with more favourable external conditions (mainly oil prices) than currently forecast, thereby allowing for rapid and thorough implementation of much-needed structural reforms. Under our baseline scenario, however, achieving reforms beyond those necessary for a post-transition adjustment will prove very complicated. As it is, the overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing cycles of boom and bust, with negative consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth, and constraining the prospects for catch-up with more developed economies, despite some solid projected growth late in the forecast period. The key variables to a successful turnaround will be the degree to which the economy is diversified from oil and whether the business environment improves to the point that domestic and external investment become key drivers of growth.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change owing to both geographical limitations and the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. Venezuela is deemed extremely vulnerable to climate change given its population distribution along coastal lines on unstable terrains. 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean Sea. Given low maintenance of infrastructure and little disaster preparedness, the population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a recent study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in the number of extreme events per year growing in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study performed by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded university, has concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration, but also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patterns may disrupt hydroelectricity generation, a major problem given that this represents over 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infrastructure projects and there is minimal focus in the way of disaster preparedness. In a recent forum with a United Nations delegation, authorities touted their plans to build apartment blocks in place of shantytowns, the logic being that concrete buildings would hold up to flooding better. There is scarce official data on carbon emissions or pollution in the country, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialised observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations. This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Venezuelan economy will be 4% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation
Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century as the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of urban population grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large Latin American countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spill-over from the country's oil wealth, the rural exodus towards the cities also created sprawling shantytowns across major metropolises, which-public housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension. This is perhaps best exemplified by Caracas, the capital, where income and wealth disparities have correlated with voter preferences for the ruling PSUV and the opposition parties.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. No official data exist, but out of a total population of around 31m, local estimates put total emigration in the past two decades at close to 3.7m people, with most having left in the past three years. These émigrés were initially primarily driven by political reasons, but the exodus is now also driven by criminal violence (Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates) and woeful economic conditions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those leaving have been primarily young, well-trained professionals, which has harmed the economy's prospects further. Under our expectation of a political transition, some of these émigrés are expected to return; how many will and how fast remains unclear
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Turkey--highlights: Political outlook
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond. The concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament suggest that policy will retain an element of unpredictability. Domestic and regional political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2019-23), and its global ranking falls by 11 places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, inadequate policy responses to tighter global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. On the positive side, with no major elections scheduled until 2023 we expect policymaking to be more orthodox compared with that in 2017-18. Large external imbalances leave Turkey's economy vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment.
Turkey--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP growth (%) 2.8 -1.7 4.1 3.4 3.6 3.8
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 16.3 16.1 10.2 7.5 7.3 6.9
Budget balance (% of GDP) -2.0 -2.3 -2.1 -2.2 -1.9 -1.7

Exchange rate TL:US$ (av) 4.8 5.7 5.7 5.9 6.1 6.3
We expect the currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession to put pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets. In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the budget deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% of GDP in 2023. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into a recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to have continued in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a full-year real GDP contraction of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
Turkey--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2013 2018 2023

Population growth   1.6 0.8
Working-age population growth   1.8 1.0
Labour force growth   3.6 1.9
The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 81.9m in 2018 to 85.4m in 2023, with the female population continuing to far outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by 0.8% per year during the forecast period, compared with growth of 1.6% during the historical period (2014-18). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of higher urbanisation rates, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control measures. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards and the average age is one of the lowest, at 32 years.
Turkey--highlights: Market opportunities

Household consumption per head (US$) 5,380 5,030 5,740 6,180 6,650 7,040
The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. In 2018 GDP per head was US$9,333 at market exchange rates and US$29,132 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. We expect Turkey's GDP per head to be US$34,200 at PPP exchange rates in 2023. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be broadly unchanged, at about 63% of the EU28 average.

Growth of real GDP per head 2.6 2.3 2.4
Growth of real GDP 3.2 2.7 2.9
Labour productivity growth 2.0 2.3 2.2
In the long term Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to be above that of other emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China. In 2019-50 we expect Turkey's economy to grow by an annual average of 2.9%. Brazil is expected to grow by an annual average of 2.1%, Russia by 1.6% and China by 3%. Nevertheless, GDP growth will be well below that recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, mainly reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU28 average, but some catch-up is likely. As a result, Turkey will remain an attractive market for international companies through-out 2019-50.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled an estimated US$175bn and imports about US$216bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$41.8bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$27.2bn (or 3.6% of estimated GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. In June 2018 they won the presidential and parliamentary elections respectively, with the support of their coalition partner, the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). In 2017 Turkey voted narrowly in favour, amid allegations of electoral fraud in the referendum, of overhauling the constitution to move to a presidential system of government with few checks and balances on the powers of the president. The relative economic stability that the AKP delivered during the initial phase of its dominance in the early 2000s has been instrumental in the party's electoral successes, as has been Mr Erdogan's personal appeal and his religious and conservative outlook, which is shared by much of the electorate. However, since 2013 political and economic instability has increased. Rather than focus on economic reform and action to ease political and social polarisation, Mr Erdogan and his party have used their control of the state institutions and two years of emergency rule introduced after the failed coup in July 2016 to silence their critics. The AKP-MHP coalition, the People's Alliance, won a combined 52% of votes at the local election on March 30th 2019, but lost control of Turkey's major cities: Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, although result for the latter was overturned and a rerun has been scheduled to take place on June 23rd.
Since 2013 political and economic instability has increased
The opposition National Alliance was formed ahead of the 2018 elections between the Republican People's Party (CHP; a social democratic party), the Felicity Party (SP; a smaller, conservative Islamic party), and the Good Party (IP; a small, right-wing nationalist party, formed by MHP defectors in late 2017). In recent years the CHP-the largest party in opposition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu-has taken an active yet often ineffective stance in defence of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The party performed poorly in the 2018 elections, but the National Alliance helped the IP to cross the threshold of 10% of national votes to enter parliament. National Alliance candidates also performed well in the 2019 mayoral elections.
The pro-Kurdish, left-wing People's Democratic Party (HDP) also managed to win enough votes in the 2018 elections to enter parliament, despite Mr Erdogan's repeated attempts to delegitimise and weaken the movement. The government has accused the HDP of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant pro-Kurdish group.

Political outlook: Political stability
In June 2018 Mr Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day the AKP secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the MHP. The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair; opposition candidates received little or no media coverage, the pro-Kurdish HDP candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison, and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the PKK and Islamic State (IS). Neither the govern-ment nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
For much of the AKP's 16-and-a-half years in power, political and government effectiveness improved. The economy was well managed and significant social reforms were implemented. However, in recent years intensifying domestic power struggles, a resurgence of terrorist violence since mid-2015 and a failed coup attempt in July 2016 have delayed reforms. The increased concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament suggest that policy predictability and its overall long-term suitability, especially from the perspective of foreign investors, are likely to be suboptimal.
In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government introduced emergency rule, which remained in place until July 2018 and allowed the government to carry out an extensive purge of personnel in the military, the judiciary, the police force and academic institutions suspected of having links the movement of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The extent of the purge initially undermined institutional capacity, although most gaps appear to have now been plugged. The quality of the bureaucracy remains moderate, and we do not foresee substantial improve-ments in 2019-23. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report, there have been improvements across most categories compared with the previous report, but starting a business in Turkey requires more time, procedures and funding than in an average high-income OECD country. Paying taxes also carries a greater burden, but registering property is simpler, even though the cost has risen since the previous report. Overall, relative to some of its peers, Turkey outperforms Brazil and China, but underperforms Russia. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2018 ranks Turkey 61st of 140 countries in terms of the burden of government regulation.
Since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised-a feature that will persist in the medium term. The Central Bank of Turkey, which out of necessity displayed increased monetary policy indepen-dence in 2018, will remain subject to pressure from Mr Erdogan's credit-driven growth approach to economic policymaking. The use of unorthodox policy instruments will thus remain highly probable. Nonetheless, the need to regain investor confidence and an empty electoral calendar until 2023 will enable the central bank to act with relatively more autonomy in the coming years.
Concerns about judicial impartiality and efficiency unlikely to be resolved
Concerns about the impartiality and efficiency of the legal system are unlikely to be resolved over the forecast period (2019-23), given the continued politicisation of the judiciary. An AKP constitutional reform package, which was approved by referendum in 2010, changed the appointment procedure and composition of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the Constitutional Court. The changes facilitated the replacement of conservative secularist-nationalists in the judiciary with Gulenists, who, until 2013, were close allies of the AKP. Shortcomings in the judicial process were highlighted in coup plot investigations and trials that began in 2007. These were only addressed at appeal stage and after suspected Gulenists in the judiciary began investigating allegations of government corruption in late 2013. The purge of Gulenists from the judiciary accelerated after the failed coup. Their replacements will probably display strong loyalty to Mr Erdogan and the AKP. The upheaval is likely to increase uncertainty in the judicial process and prolong cases further. The courts' tendency to interpret the law in favour of the state and at the expense of the individual is unlikely to change, especially in cases involving minority rights and freedom of speech. In our business environment ranking we expect transparency and fairness of the judicial process to remain poor and its efficiency to deteriorate over the forecast period.
Foreign businesses operating in Turkey can reduce some of the uncertainty caused by the legal process by incorporating international arbitration clauses into their contracts. These help to shorten the time that it takes to resolve commercial dis-putes and prevent, in most cases, the need for intervention by the Turkish courts.
Corruption in the public sector is seen as a major deterrent by potential international investors. Legislation has been introduced to tackle it but implementation will continue to be a problem and political patronage is likely to remain widespread. The public procurement law of 2003 was drafted to meet EU standards, but has since been watered down and amended so that important sectors, such as transport and energy, have been excluded. Turkey has improved compliance with the OECD's anti-bribery convention.
Political outlook: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parlia-mentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to win more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections took place on March 31st 2019. The AKP and the MHP retained a majority of the national vote. However, in the midst of an economic recession the ruling parties lost vital cities such as Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city (where a rerun of the poll will be held on June 23rd). Losing major cities is a blow to the AKP given the public resources that the cities command. However, Mr Erdogan's tight grip on national institutions and the media means that he will continue to dominate Turkish politics in the coming years.
Political outlook: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. We do not expect a breakdown in relations, but this forecast is highly uncertain. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup, US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups, Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran, and US sanctions on Turkish officials due to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October 2018).
In 2019 relations with the US will continue to be tested owing to Turkey's decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system. The decision puts Turkey at risk of being excluded from the ongoing development of the F-35 fighter jet programme and of facing economic sanctions under the US Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). We expect that Turkey and the US will find a solution that will enable Turkey to obtain a waiver from US sanctions or avoid them altogether. With the economy in recession, Turkey can ill afford the cost of sanctions. The US is unlikely to want to pursue a course of action that would lead to a strengthening of Turkey-Russia ties and potentially set the stage for a complete collapse in US-Turkey relations.
Relations between Turkey and EU will remain transactional
We do not expect Turkey to back down from the purchase (delivery is due in July 2019). This is due to both Mr Erdogan's desire to assert Turkey's national sovereignty and the negative effect that such an action would have on Turkey's relationship with Russia, a necessary partner in neighbouring Syria. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. Thus, a deterioration in relations could jeopardise Turkey's control of territory across the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates river-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. It could also limit Turkey's influence in Idlib, a city in northern Syria, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups. In September 2018 Turkey, Russia and Iran reached an agreement to forestall a regime offensive against Idlib. Such an attack could result in another surge of refugee flows into Turkey.
Relations between Turkey and the EU will also remain transactional, as both have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU was to suspend Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to NATO forces or withdrew from NATO altogether.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment score for Turkey deterior-ates slightly in the forecast period (2019-23), and the country's global ranking falls by 11 places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, and inadequate policy responses to tighter global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Large external imbalances leave Turkey's economy vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. After several turbulent months, with a currency collapse in August 2018, the authorities adopted measures to halt speculative trades in the lira, and in September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey raised its main policy rate by 625 basis points, to 24%. Tighter monetary policy has dampened economic activity, as expected, but it has failed so far to restore macroeconomic stability, reflecting the absence of concrete structural reform plans to correct imbalances over the medium term.
Major business environment shortcomings include the politicisation of regulatory bodies and the judicial system, cronyism and corruption, mismatches between education and labour market needs, and widespread tax evasion. In addition, the government used emergency powers over the two years to July 2018 to seize or close about 1,000 firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement, which the government believes staged a failed coup in 2016. The seized firms are being liquidated or sold to government-friendly groups. Foreign companies' assets have not been seized, but the erosion of the rule of law will deter foreign investors. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment (FDI). Major attractions for investors include Turkey's geographic location, its potential market size, its young and growing population, a customs union with the EU, free foreign-exchange and capital flows, and a large and dynamic private sector.

Business environment outlook: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse in 2018-19. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced, but evasion remains widespread.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018-19. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Mismatches between education and labour market needs persist.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

The quality of economic policymaking and its institutional underpinnings have deteriorated in recent years. Under the executive presidential system Recep Tayyip Erdogan has used his new powers to extend his control over the central bank and other nominally independent authorities, which has resulted in inadequate macroeconomic policies and a loss of foreign investor confidence in economic decision-making. Relative to 2017-18, we should see some improve-ment in the country's policy stance in 2019-23 (following the June 2019 Istanbul election re-run), given that the next election isn't until until 2023. However, progress is likely to be insufficient to substantially improve investor confidence in policy. Mr Erdogan will be likely to continue to favour a pro-growth approach to economic policy-making (not least to avoid potential social discontent).
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political and financial instability, largely owing to the country's solid public finances, and its well-capitalised and well-regulated banking sector. Turkey's public debt is currently low, at just under 30% of GDP, but increased public borrowing to support economic activity after the failed coup in 2016 has resulted in a steady widening of the budget deficit. Despite promising to maintain fiscal discipline to help to curb inflation, we expect the government to provide further support to the economy in the current slowdown and seek to address the risks to banks stemming from a sharp rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), in order to revive lending growth. Credit-driven economic growth will eventually feed through into higher levels of indebtedness and a widening of the current-account deficit, which has narrowed sharply in 2018-19. The financial system will remain vulnerable to political interference, high levels of private-sector foreign-currency debt, lira weakness and tighter global liquidity conditions.
Volatile domestic demand, reliance on indirect taxation, limited price competition in some sectors-particularly agriculture-and the sensitivity of prices to exchange-rate and commodity-price movements will make it difficult to reduce consumer price inflation to the officially targeted 5% in the medium term. Although down from the 2018 peak of 25% year on year in October 2018 caused by the sharp depreciation of the lira in July-August, inflation remained high, at just below 20% in February-April 2019.

Turkey has a large and dynamic private sector, and private property is generally well protected. However, the country's score and ranking will remain low in this category in the forecast period owing to the significant role of the state in many sectors, widespread political patronage and corruption, and politicisation of the legal system. The use of emergency powers introduced in response to the failed coup in 2016 to seize or close firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement has created uncertainty, particularly because of limited access to legal redress. The state of emergency was lifted in July 2018, but the security law passed in that same month and the concentration of power under Mr Erdogan means that a high degree of uncertainty will continue in the medium term.
Weak rule of law has created uncertainty
We expect government support for private-sector investment and employ-ment to continue. This will come through incentives such as tax breaks, and social security and credit subsidies, with an emphasis on underdeveloped regions, technology, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), production of currently imported intermed-iary goods and "strategic" sectors (such as defence, aerospace, automotive and pharmaceuticals). After the failed coup the Ministry of Treasury and Finance expanded its guarantees for banks, allowing them to lend to riskier customers, but it must now address the risks to banks from a sharp increase in NPLs. The government is seeking to help Turkish banks to clear their balance sheets and has pledged to inject TL28bn (US$4.7bn) into state banks to shore up capital reserves and stimulate fresh lending.
Government is seeking to help banks to clear their balance sheets
Free competition is likely to remain the norm in most sectors. The Competition Board has power over mergers and acquisitions (M&A), price-fixing and abuse of market position. Like most other regulatory agencies, however, the Competition Board will have limited effective independence, as it is appointed by the president. The state is also likely to remain dominant in many of the sectors in which it plays a leading role, such as gas and water, rail transport, tea and sugar production, infrastructure, and social services (including healthcare and education). The state also has a significant position in banking (about 30% of total assets), mining, the defence industry, postal services and legal gambling, and retains large stakes in Turk Telekom (30%) and Turkish Airlines (49%). There is a state-owned broadcaster (TRT) and a state-owned home-builder (TOKI). There are also sectors in which one or more private firms, including privatised companies, hold strong market positions.
Despite frequent legal challenges, privatisation is well advanced in numerous sectors, including oil refining, parts of the energy sector, steel, mobile telecommunications, and tobacco and alcoholic drinks. The sale of power-distribution networks has been completed, and the government aims to continue divesting some generation assets. However, we expect the slowdown in the pace of privatisation since 2014 to continue during the forecast period, owing to market volatility and the government's focus on retaining control and enhancing the value of strategic assets.
State assets transferred to the Turkey Wealth Fund unlikely to be privatised
Assets that have been slated for privatisation include operating rights for more ports, the national lottery and horse racing concessions, shares in toll roads and bridges, TOKI, Vakifbank, more power plants, Istanbul's municipal companies, and some state-owned land. Control of the three main state banks-Halkbank, Ziraat and Vakif bank-looks set to remain in state hands. These banks may sometimes be used as a source of patronage.
The establishment in 2016 of the Turkey Wealth Fund has removed some government assets from the control of the privatisation agency. The wealth fund is designed to help to finance large public works by using its assets as collateral, making sales of the assets under its control less likely. The fund now includes assets such as the state's stake in Turkish Airlines, Halkbank, Turk Telekom, Ziraat Bank, Borsa Istanbul and Botas-an oil and gas pipeline operator.
Price controls operate for various reasons in electricity, gas, petroleum, telecoms and pharmaceuticals. Competition will continue to be constrained by the large shadow economy; the smuggling of petroleum products, cigarettes and many other items; and the violation of intellectual property rights in many sectors, from software to fashion.
Political patronage and exclusive business networks will continue to play a significant role in business life. Companies close to government circles may be boldest in entering public tenders or operating in sectors where major decisions are taken by politicians, regulators or bureaucrats. Industrial policy may facilitate favouritism or uncompetitive arrangements. Some companies may face higher bureaucratic obstacles or tougher tax inspections than others.
Build-operate-transfer (BOT) or public-private partnership (PPP) schemes will increase the role of the private sector in the management of airports, water and irrigation facilities, and hospitals. The railways are being restructured, and the rail network has been separated from train services. The state will continue to play a dominant role in the sector for some time to come, as so far only a few freight rail transport licences have been granted to private operators.
Despite public ownership of major assets, a more liberalised energy sector will emerge as a result of privatisation, new investments, the Electricity Market Law of March 2013 and changes in regulations that will widen consumer choice over power providers. A wholesale trading platform aimed at setting a reliable market price for electricity has been established. Gas market reform is likely to continue to lag behind that of the electricity sector.
There is scope for further improvement in the protection of intellectual property. Legislation has been gradually brought in line with EU practices. In particular, a single, unified industrial property law came into force in January 2017 that replaced a patchwork of decrees regulating trademarks, patents, designs and geographical indications. Both Turkish and foreign companies are increas-ingly sensitive to this issue, so there is also likely to be progress in enforcement.

Foreign direct investment will continue to be welcomed in most cases
Turkey's score and ranking deteriorates in this category in the forecast period, even though the government and most sections of society regard FDI in a positive light, and high levels of foreign ownership in industry and services are widely accepted and respected. Turkey's heavy dependency on foreign-capital inflows gives the government additional incentives to attract FDI. A law passed in 2012 has boosted sales of property to foreigners by easing restrictions and waiving the condition of reciprocity for most countries. However, foreign-ownership is restricted in a few areas, including broadcasting and civil aviation, and the government has become more suspicious of foreign capital. The courts and sections of the public are also occasionally hostile towards foreign investors when environmental issues or natural resources are at stake. Turkey's politicised judicial system, its poor record on corruption and widespread political patronage remain major deterrents for potential foreign investors.
Privatisation in energy and other sectors may provide opportunities for foreign investors, often in conjunction with local partners. The government will especially promote FDI in greenfield and expansion projects that can further its industrial policy goals, including import substitution and technological innovation. Low asset valuations as a result of the depreciation of the lira against most major currencies in 2018-19 may also attract investors, particularly to export-oriented firms that have receipts in US dollars.
In principle, foreign investors will continue to have the same access to government incentives as domestic investors do. Plans to improve the general investment environment by cutting red tape and streamlining the legal system will benefit foreign as well as domestic businesses. Restrictions on repatriation of profits are highly unlikely, even at times of financial market stress.

Political rifts with trading partners have caused disruption to bilateral trade
As a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with a customs union with the EU, Turkey remains committed to a broadly open trading regime. However, global trade tensions and political rifts with trading partners have periodically caused disruption to bilateral trade and exacerbated exchange-rate volatility. Russian restrictions following the downing of a Russian military jet on the Turkish-Syrian border in 2015 imposed severe losses on the Turkish agri-culture and tourism sectors in 2016. In 2018 escalating tensions with the US resulted in tit-for-tat sanctions and tariffs on aluminium and steel trade between the two countries. Under the 1996 customs union with the EU, Turkey has customs-free trade in manufactured goods with EU member states and has adopted the EU common customs tariff. However, the country has refused to grant Greek Cypriot ships and planes access to its ports and airports unless the EU facilitates direct trade between the EU and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is only currently recognised by Turkey. Turkey's import regime reflects the EU's free-trade agreements (FTAs). It has bilateral FTAs with the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA).
The Turkish lira has been fully convertible since 1989, and the authorities have not considered introducing capital-account controls, even during recent periods of severe exchange-rate and financial market volatility. The authorities in Turkey are keenly aware of the reputational damage that capital controls could cause, including potentially impeding Turkey's access to international financial markets for several years.
The government is unlikely to resort to outright protectionism, despite its efforts to encourage domestic production of items currently imported in large quantities. However, short-term protective measures will continue to be employed to limit imports of textiles, petrochemicals and other items from lower-cost countries. Some restrictions on agricultural imports exist, but, concerned by high food price inflation, the authorities have in recent years tinkered with tariffs and quotas in order to lower prices.
Turkey and the EU have agreed to revisit the current customs union agreement with a view to expanding it to potentially cover agricultural goods, services and public procurement, but talks have not yet started. Some EU politicians have suggested that talks should be linked to political criteria. If this were to be the case, the chances of reaching an agreement any time soon would be low. Turkey is negotiating or pursuing FTAs with several other economies, especially countries such as Mexico and Japan, which signed FTAs with the EU in 2018.
In the absence of a Cyprus settlement, Turkey is likely to resist EU pressure to open ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. Similarly, without progress in its EU accession negotiations, Turkey is unlikely to lift restrictions on EU meat and used-car imports, eliminate discriminatory taxes on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, or open up trade in services.

As a percentage of GDP, tax revenue is low by OECD standards, owing to high levels of evasion and limited administrative capacity. According to OECD figures, tax revenue (including social security contributions) comprises about 25% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of about 34% (2017 data). The corporate tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018 for a period of three years. Personal income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. The tax-free allowance for wage and salary earners varies from the equivalent of 50-90% of the minimum wage, according to the number of their dependants. Seventy percent of tax revenue comes from indirect taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), which is levied at a standard rate of 18% (with lower rates of 8% and 1% for some items), and special consumption taxes on some goods and services such as petroleum, alcohol, tobacco products, motor vehicles, telecoms services and banking transactions.
Obligatory social security contributions normally consist of 20.5% of gross salary (up to a certain limit) from the employer, 14% from the employee and a combined total of 3% to the Unemployment Insurance Fund from both parties. Tax breaks, social security premium reductions and incentives are available to encourage investment in underdeveloped regions, important sectors and technological innovation, as well as to support employment.
Frequent changes in tax regulation and evasion are likely to persist
Frequent changes in tax regulation are likely to persist, as will widespread tax and social security evasion, which is encouraged by frequent amnesties and opportunities to restructure arrears. The latest example was announced in May 2018, mainly to garner political support ahead of the snap presidential and parliamentary elections. Plans to simplify the tax system have been on the government agenda for some time, but have been consistently postponed.
Foreign firms will continue to be treated in the same way as Turkish companies. During the forecast period Turkey is expected to expand the already large number of double taxation agreements that it has with other countries.

The banking system is solid, but its vulnerability has increased
Turkey's financing score and rankings deteriorate during the forecast period, reflecting the banking sector's increased vulnerability in recent years to political interference, financial market volatility, currency weakness, high levels of private-sector foreign-currency debt and tighter global liquidity conditions. Reforms introduced under the guidance of the IMF and the World Bank in the wake of the financial crisis in Turkey in 2000-01 transformed the banking sector so that it has been well regulated, well capitalised and highly profitable. Three state-controlled banks and four large private banks dominate the sector, accounting for about 75% of total assets. The state banks have largely operated on a commercial basis, and government intervention in the private sector has been rare. However, after periodic surges in bank lending growth since 2010-driven by falling government borrowing needs, strong domestic and global liquidity, as well as government credit guarantees and pressure on banks to lend more and at lower interest rates-Turkish banks have become increasingly vulnerable to the risks from a sharp rise in NPLs as a result of the economic downturn triggered by the collapse of the lira in 2018-19. In the first seven months of 2018 bank credit to the non-financial sector expanded at an average annual rate of about 23%, but since the financial market turmoil in 2018 it has slowed sharply, to about 12% in the first quarter of 2019. NPLs have been increasing rapidly since mid-2018, rising by 62.5% year on year in March 2019.
Tighter global liquidity and high levels of corporate debt will restrict credit to the private sector, especially households and small businesses. However, the strongest Turkish companies, like banks, will continue to have access to loans from foreign banks and to local and international bond markets, albeit at high interest rates by international standards.
With economic activity slowing sharply and debt servicing more onerous, because of the weakness of the lira and higher interest rates, NPLs will continue to rise sharply. As at March 2019 the ratio of NPLs to total credit reached 4.4%-its highest level since November 2010, up from just 3.1% as at August 2018. Low domestic savings will also remain a constraint. The government has pledged further changes to the private pension system, which if implemented would help to increase the availability of finance with longer maturities, albeit only over the medium term.
Difficult financial conditions are likely to slow further the pace of share offerings on the volatile Borsa Istanbul, the country's main stock exchange. Market capitalisation is low and falling, at about 20% of GDP at end-2018, down from about 28% in 2017. About two-thirds of the free float is foreign-owned during periods of financial stability, but this figure has declined as a result of the sell-off of Turkish assets since April 2018. As at early May 2019 BIST 100, Turkey's benchmark share price index, was up by about 2% on end-2018, following a decline of about 21% in 2018.
Changes in bank ownership may occur, particularly among smaller banks, without changing the overall structure of the sector. The current government's antipathy towards private bank owners and sympathy for consumers and credit customers will encourage tighter regulation of certain banking activities, such as credit-card issuance.
In late 2017 a deputy managing director of Halkbank was convicted in New York of bank fraud and conspiracy to violate US sanctions on Iran. The case has raised the possibility of fines or sanctions against HalkBank or other Turkish entities. Such a decision would further raise risks for the banking sector. In December 2018 the bank announced that it would issue up to US$2bn in Eurobonds-the first such issuance since the arrest of the bank executive.

We do not expect any improvement in Turkey's labour market score in the forecast period. There is a large, young labour pool, but workforce participation is only about 52%, partly owing to traditions that discourage female employment. Despite a greater number of years of formal education, the average level of education and skills remains below average European standards, and mismatches between education and the needs of the labour market persist. Employment of foreigners is rare, and obtaining work permits can be problematic, but some restrictions have been eased. Informal employment and subcontracting are common ways of avoiding tax, legal obligations and rigidities, and create unfair competition, undermine safety standards and hinder product-ivity gains. In formal employment, hours and conditions are generally regulated and inflexible. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose by 3.5 percentage points, to 13.3%, in the 12 months to January 2019 (14.7% unadjusted). The adjusted youth unemployment rate reached 24.5%, close to a ten-year high.
In response to employers' complaints about high labour costs, the government has sought to lighten the burden of social security contributions, especially for underdeveloped regions and the employment of young people, women and people with disabilities. Following rises of 30% in 2016, 8% in 2017, an estimated 14% in 2018 and a forecast 26% in 2019, the monthly gross minimum wage is relatively high in Turkish lira terms, at TL2,020. However, it has fallen sharply in US dollar terms, to about US$340, as a result of the depreciation of the lira, which has also weighed on growth in real wages owing to higher inflation rates.
The change to severance pay may take several years to implement
Companies complain that the system of severance pay, under which employers are liable to pay substantial lump sums to employees who retire, or are made redundant, is too generous, hindering formal hiring. The government's plan is to establish a severance pay fund, to which employers will contribute, but the plan has met with resistance from unions. The change to severance pay may take some years to implement.
The government aims to make the labour market more flexible while improving access to unemployment benefits. We expect the use of flexible employment contracts in the formal sector to increase only slowly. Labour market activation and education policies will raise skills levels and workforce participation only gradually. Despite the government's commitment to reducing it, unregistered employment is likely to remain a significant issue throughout the forecast period.
Restrictions on union membership, strikes and lock-outs that are incompatible with international norms promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU are unlikely to be lifted. Unions may be influential in a few sectors, but are unlikely to become stronger or more militant.

Turkey's infrastructure is broadly adequate for doing business. In recent years investment by national and local governments, as well as the private sector, have led to some visible improvements, ranging from rapid growth of domestic air travel to the gradual extension of the natural gas pipeline network to almost all provinces, and the spread of broadband internet access and mobile-phone services. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) government's preference has been for large infrastructure projects with several grandiose projects in the pipeline. The contract for the construction and subsequent operation of a 3.9-km-long suspension bridge over the Dardanelles was awarded to a three-company consortium, including Limak, one of the contractors of the new Istanbul airport project, in 2017. Canal Istanbul, a canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, and a three-tier undersea tunnel across the Bosphorus are also in the process of being tendered.
Fixed-line broadband internet access has expanded rapidly, but, at an estimated 16.3% in 2018, the penetration rate was still well below an average of 30-40% for most other European countries. Including large and rapidly rising numbers of mobile broadband subscriptions, the penetration rate is much higher. The take-up of fourth-generation (4G and 4.5G) technology launched in 2016 has been strong.
Major infrastructure projects are under way, but shortcomings persist
Infrastructure shortcomings-including urban overcrowding, congestion, earthquake risk, and strains on water supply, waste disposal systems and the energy network-will persist in most cities. Rural infrastructure should improve a little in most places. Major irrigation works will proceed slowly.
Improvements in road and rail transport infrastructure will be piecemeal, and as a whole will continue to lag behind EU standards, especially given the long distances between cities. Public and private investment will ensure that seaport capacity expands, despite bottlenecks and incomplete privatisation of management rights at some state-owned ports.
Energy sector privatisation and market liberalisation will continue gradually. Legislation facilitating the privatisation of lignite reserves is being implemented. Private investment (coupled with limited public investment) may be enough to increase power-generation capacity, cut transmission and distribution losses and prevent blackouts. Policies favouring energy generation from local and renewable sources will help to reduce gradually reliance on imported fuels.
We expect legislation to encourage private-sector oil and gas exploration to lead to an intensification of offshore activity in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The government is exploring the possibility of exploiting shale gas in the south east and other parts of Turkey. Plans to construct two nuclear plants are highly controversial. If built, they will not come on stream until the early 2020s.

E-commerce is growing rapidly, but growth is from a low base
E-commerce is growing rapidly, reflecting steady improvements in the online environment in areas such as security and after-sales service, but growth is from a low base with online purchases accounting for only about 4% of total retail sales, compared with about 10% in developed economies. As in most countries, the number of fixed-line subscriptions has declined steadily, but mobile-phone penetration has risen rapidly, reaching almost 100% in 2018. Intense competition in the mobile-telecoms sector should ensure that infrastructure remains adequate and up to date, although there may be delays in adopting the latest technology or it may initially be expensive or concentrated in major cities. Computer ownership has risen rapidly. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), an estimated 84% of households had access to the internet in 2018, up from about 30% in 2009.
Research and development (R&D) spending in Turkey rose only marginally in 2017, to 1% of GDP. However, given that nominal GDP growth was about 19% in that year, R&D spending rose strongly in nominal terms, which we expect to continue during the forecast period. R&D spending is significantly greater than in Romania and broadly in line with that in Greece, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia (which averaged 0.9-1% of GDP in 2017). As in most emerging economies, large, export-oriented private-sector firms account for the bulk of R&D spending in Turkey. The automotive sector, which is largely comprised of joint ventures between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, accounted for 14% of total R&D spending in 2017.
FDI will continue to be the main driver of investment in technology and innovation. According to data from the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office, about 60% of total patent applications are foreign. As FDI into Turkey gradually recovers in our forecast period, we expect R&D spending to increase progressively.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession to put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets.
With the March 2019 local elections out of the way, the rerun of the Istanbul poll scheduled for June, and the next parliamentary and presidential elections not due until mid-2023, the government will soon be in a position to defuse domestic political tensions and take a more long-term approach to policy-making. This would help to revive investor confidence and foster sustainable economic growth, reversing the pattern of the past three years of ad hoc policy measures, which boosted the economy but exacerbated Turkey's macro-economic imbalances and diminished the government's credibility. However, an element of unpredictability and unorthodoxy will remain. The economy is in recession and, following its recent poor performance in local elections, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will continue to feel under pressure to support growth. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mis-matches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in the 2019-23 forecast period.
Should the recent currency crisis trigger a banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia has tense relations. Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Only China appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey (perhaps as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative).

Budget balance -2.0 -2.3 -2.1 -2.2 -1.9 -1.7
Government debt 28.9 28.0 27.3 27.3 27.1 26.6
Under the AKP, the public finances have been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax increases in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits caused the deficit to widen in 2018, to 2% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% of GDP in 2023.
The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.9% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), in the context of economic turmoil after the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to about 26.5% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.

Deposit rate (av) 18.1 21.0 15.3 13.0 10.5 10.0
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is currently above the main policy rate, however. The bank is providing funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% greater than the one-week repo rate.
At its meeting on April 25th the MPC kept its one-week repo lending rate unchanged, at 24%. We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will lower gradually its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that the central bank will continue to overshoot its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.

Government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2017 (from 3.3% in 2016), but this surge exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018, which we expect to continue in the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a contraction in full-year real GDP of 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly due to base effects), followed by annual average growth of 3.7% per year in 2020-23.
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 4.1% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.6% per year. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts: these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
As in most developing countries, the share of agriculture in nominal GDP has declined steadily in Turkey in recent decades, but at 6.4% of gross value added in 2018 agriculture remains an important sector, especially considering the input that it makes to Turkey's food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing industry. In addition, agriculture still accounts for a substantial share-of about 19%-of total employment, although almost half of those employed in the sector are classified as unpaid family workers. We expect the share of output of the primary sector to remain broadly stable during the forecast period, but it will remain large compared with most other European countries, at more than 6% of GDP in 2023. In 2016 the sector was hit by Russian sanctions on agricultural imports from Turkey, but most were lifted by mid-2017 following the rapprochement between the two countries in June 2016. The sector would benefit from investment in irrigation in the south east of the country and in some other regions, but investment is likely to remain on hold in areas affected by the conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More generally, the importance of modern, large-scale agricultural enterprises will spread gradually, but the problems of traditional agriculture and unclear policymaking are likely to persist.
Manufacturing will continue to play central role in the Turkish economy
Industry, including manufacturing, mining and construction, accounted for about 31% of GDP in 2018. The collapse in investment and export demand during the 2008-09 global crisis hit the manufacturing and construction sectors hardest. Since then manufacturing, and particularly construction, has re-bounded. In 2018 manufacturing accounted for about 21% of GDP, compared with about 25% at the end of the 1990s. Having fallen as low as 6.3% of GDP in 2009, the share of GDP generated by the construction sector rose to 9.7% in 2016 and 2017, before sliding back to 8% in 2018 as activity in the sector contracted.
Construction was a significant driver of economic growth in 2010-17. In 2017 real value added in the sector, which is dominated by housing construction and mega infrastructure projects, expanded by 9%, following growth of about 5% in the previous three years. The pace of housing construction outstripped demand for several years, even after allowing for strong demographically driven growth in the number of households and the continued replacement of existing buildings. In 2017 growth was bolstered by a strong expansion in credit as a result of pressure by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on banks to lower mortgage rates; the indirect effect of the credit guarantee fund; the relaxation of macroprudential measures and ample global international liquidity. This has resulted in a reported 1.5m-2m new homes being unoccupied, a situation that has weakened developers' finances and reduced the incentive for new investments. Infrastructure and building investments via public-private partnerships, which have picked up significantly over the past five years, have also contributed to robust construction growth. In 2018 construction output declined by 1.9%, and this weakness is likely to persist into 2019 given the oversupply of housing, rising NPLs in the sector, the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar, high interest rates and the slowdown in economic growth.
Although several manufacturing subsectors, such as automotive, and textiles and clothing, are strongly export-oriented and will continue to generate trade surpluses, Turkey's manufactured exports are generally import intensive. A large portion of the inputs-including energy, intermediates and capital goods-are imported, adding to Turkey's external imbalances, especially when inter-national commodity prices are high or the lira is weak, as it has been since mid-2013. This structural situation is unlikely to change much during the forecast period, as reducing the import intensity of exports and moving up the value-added chain will take time, even though these were explicit goals in the government's investment-incentive system, which was introduced in 2012.
Vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe
The automotive sector was Turkey's biggest exporter in 2018, with exports valued at about US$21.9bn (including automotive parts), up from US$20.1bn in 2017, according to the Automotive Manufacturers Association (OSD). Despite the increase in value terms, there was a decline in overall production in real terms. Turkey runs a considerable trade surplus in its automotive sector, and this surplus has expanded owing to strong export demand but also import restrictions and the weak currency. Output fell by 8.6% in 2018 compared with 2017 (when production rose by 14%), but, boosted by the weaker lira, the US dollar value of exports rose by 10.3%, according to the OSD. Output of passenger cars was down by 10.2% year on year in 2018, and commercial vehicle production fell by 5.3%. In the first three months of 2019 car production fell another 17.4% year on year and truck output declined 16.6% year on year.
Most vehicle manufacturers will maintain facilities in Turkey
Almost 80% of motor vehicles produced in Turkey are exported, and the bulk of these go to the EU (Turkey accounts for almost 30% of vehicles imported by the EU). As a result, vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe. Demand in Europe picked up between mid-2013 and mid-2018, reflecting the release of pent-up demand after several years of weakness and a broadening of the economic recovery across Europe. Demand in Europe has weakened since mid-2018, but the significant depreciation of the lira against the US dollar and euro is likely to continue to support firm export volumes over the medium term. Given its location and its trade agreement with the EU, Turkey will remain an important automotive hub, but political uncertainties will weigh on investor confidence. Over the medium term, considering the growth potential of the automotive market in Turkey and the wider region, manufacturers with production plants in Turkey may start to focus more on the Turkish, Middle Eastern and North African markets. Over the medium term the domestic market will be supported by rising incomes and replacement demand.
We believe that most manufacturers will maintain their production facilities in Turkey. These facilities are technologically advanced, and labour costs are much lower in Turkey than in core European countries, and probably lower than those in most central and east European countries, where wages have risen strongly following accession to the EU. However, if Turkey is to remain a major automotive production location in the medium to long term, manufacturers will have to move away from exporting low-end passenger cars, light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and components to north European markets, and towards developing and producing alternative energy engines and vehicles. There are signs that this transition is already happening; in 2017 sales of electric and hybrid cars rose by more than 350%, to 4,528 units, according to data from Turkey's Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. The market will be supported by recent cuts to taxes on hybrid and electric vehicles.
The textiles and clothing industries remain important
The textiles and clothing industries remain important to the Turkish economy, accounting for 16.3% of the country's export revenues in 2018. The industries have undergone restructuring under the intense pressure of competition from low-cost producers in Asia. The government has also been looking at ways to improve investment incentives and target higher value-added products. In the short term, high-frequency indicators suggest that both these industries will suffer from subdued domestic demand. However, over the medium term a more competitive currency and ample growth potential will underpin robust growth prospects. Competitive pressures from lower-cost centres of production will remain a risk.
Production of industrial machinery, and of white goods and other household durables, including furniture, recovered strongly as a result of a pick-up in domestic demand and export opportunities in 2010-11. After more moderate domestic and external demand dampened growth in output in 2012-16, growth surged in 2017 alongside the boom in housing and credit, but a weak lira in 2018 is likely to have curbed domestic demand. We expect Turkish consumer electronics companies to continue to be major exporters, although subdued domestic demand will constrain the sector in the near term. Businesses in the sector appear to have been slow to adopt technological innovations in some segments.
Reduced security concerns and price competitiveness will drive tourism growth
Tourism, one of the most important services sectors of the Turkish economy, has witnessed rapid growth in the past ten years, but remains vulnerable to geopolitical developments and changes in the exchange rate. Having reached a new record of 37m in 2014, the number of foreign visitors (excluding Turkish citizens living abroad) dipped slightly in 2015, reflecting mainly the impact of EU/US trade sanctions on the Russian economy (visitors from Russia, Turkey's second-largest tourist market, fell by 18.5%) and perceived security concerns following a spate of terrorist attacks in the second half of the year. In 2016 tourism was hit hard by Russian sanctions, which have now been lifted, and by terrorist attacks. Figures from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism put the total number of foreign visitor arrivals in 2016 at 25.4m-a year-on-year fall of 30%. In 2017 the number of foreign visitors rebounded, rising by an annual average of 27.8% per year. In 2018 the number of foreign visitors rose by 21.8%, to 39.5m, as visitors from Russia rose to a record 6m, from just 866,000 two years earlier (when bilateral relations hit a low point and Russia imposed sanctions on Turkey). Visitors from other European countries remained unchanged in 2017 from 2016 levels, when the number plummeted by 31.1%, to 13.2m, from 19.1m in 2015. Strong growth in visitors from countries such as Germany and the UK in 2018 suggest that security concerns are no longer deterring visitors from those important markets. The pronounced depreciation of the lira will contribute to robust growth in tourism inflows in the coming years.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.2 4.1 4.6 5.0 5.4 5.7
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices drove inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a limited depreciation of the lira (against the US dollar), a lower average global oil price and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2018 will prevent inflation from declining faster than would otherwise be the case. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.1% in 2019-only marginally slower than the 2018 rate-slowing to 6.9% in 2023.
We expect the moderating trend in inflation to continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 10.2% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).

In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of the year. In the first months of 2019 the lira has again depreciated against the US dollar owing to political uncertainty and polarising campaign rhetoric around the March local elections, declining central bank foreign-exchange reserves, the re-emergence of tensions with the US-this time owing to Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made defence system-and the rerun of the Istanbul mayoral race following the AKP's defeat.
The lira again surpassed TL6:US$1 in early May, and we expect a gradual appreciation from this level in the second half of the year and a year-end exchange rate of about TL:5.70:US$1. This forecast rests on our expectation that Turkey and the US will resolve their disputes, that government policy will be credibly reoriented and that the central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy stance, lowering interest rates only as price pressures fade. There are large risks to this forecast, both in terms of probability and impact. If any of our expectations do not materialise, the lira could again depreciate substantially.
Economic forecast: External sector
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to depreciate as the current-account deficit widens and as central banks in advanced economies re-embark on a path of monetary policy tightening. Thereafter still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although not as large as that in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.4:US$1 by the end of 2023.

We expect the current-account deficit to narrow as a share of GDP in 2019, to 0.7%, from 3.6% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2017, as the lira's depreciation against both the US dollar and the euro depresses imports (owing to a decline in domestic demand) and boosts export competitiveness. From 2020 we expect the deficit to widen gradually, to a still relatively moderate 3.4% per year on average in 2020-23. The smaller deficits compared with historical levels reflect significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018-19 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Turkey
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose dramatically in 2005-08, to 2.9% of GDP, after averaging a modest 0.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004. In the context of the global economic and financial crisis, they slowed again in 2009-10 and have remained below the average level of 3.2% of GDP reached in 2006-08. Inflows of FDI, including sales of real estate to non-residents, declined to about US$13.5bn, or 1.5% of GDP, per year in 2012-14, before picking up to about US$19.3bn, or 2.2% of GDP, in 2015. In 2016-18 FDI inflows fell to an average of US$12.8bn, or 1.6% of GDP. In 2019 we expect FDI inflows to be subdued owing to high economic and policy uncertainty. In 2020-23 we expect a gradual recovery in inflows as the economy strengthens and some delayed privatisations get under way. The stock of inward FDI stood at just 25.3% of GDP in 2018-well below levels in regional competitors such as Romania and Poland (between 40-50% of GDP), and Bulgaria and Slovakia (75-80%). Following a fall from US$4.1bn in 2012 to US$3.6bn in 2013, Turkish outward FDI jumped to US$7bn in 2014, largely reflecting a small number of large transactions, notably the acquisition of the UK-based United Biscuits by Yildiz Holding, a Turkish conglomerate of food manufacturers. The figure has eased, falling to US$2.7bn in 2017 and US$3.6bn in 2018, presumably owing to the high domestic funding needs and divestment by foreign firms due to greater economic and policy uncertainty.
Origin and distribution
The traditional sources of foreign capital in Turkey have been multinational companies based in major EU countries, especially the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany, and in other OECD countries such as the US, Switzerland and Japan. Individual large investments from several smaller EU countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Brazil have amended this pattern in recent years, and there have also been some significant purchases by private equity funds. A majority of foreign investment appears to go to Istanbul-the commercial capital where most national Turkish companies have their headquarters. Investment projects of foreign capital companies are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Marmara region (which includes Istanbul), the Aegean region, the Mediterranean and Ankara, the capital. Historically, manufacturing (particularly the chemicals, food and automotive industries) and financial services attracted the most FDI. In 2012 construction featured prominently, with about 13% of net FDI inflows, although this was the result of the inclusion in this category of a single investment by the French-based Aéroports de Paris, which bought a 38% stake in Turkey's airport operator; TAV Airports; and a 49% stake in its construction arm, TAV Construction. In 2015 the share of FDI of financial services rose sharply, to 30% of the total, from about 17% in the previous year; this again reflected the impact of a single large investment in which a Spanish bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), increased its stake in Garanti Bank. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals was the second-largest category in 2015, accounting for 15% of total FDI inflows. Problems in developed economies, and the euro zone crisis in particular, together with the more recent deterioration in economic prospects in Turkey, has led to divestments by foreign financial institutions, many of which entered the Turkish market in 2005-08. As part of a plan to shore up its capital base, the National Bank of Greece has sold its 99.8% stake in Finans Bank, but because the sale, which was completed in mid-2016, was to Qatar National Bank, it did not affect net inward FDI figures in 2016. In 2017 OMV, an Austrian energy group, sold off its 100% stake in Petrol Ofisi, a Turkish petrol retailer. A neutral impact will also result from the planned sale of Denizbank by Sberbank to Emirates NBD (agreed in 2018). The lira crisis in 2018 delayed completion of the deal, which led to the terms of the sale being revised in April 2019. The sale is expected to be completed in the coming months.
Foreign property purchases, which are included in balance-of-payments statistics for FDI, have been making a solid contribution to net inflows since 2005. In 2005-13 net inflows averaged a solid US$2.5bn per year, before picking up to an average of US$4.6bn in 2014-18. In view of the excess supply, lira weakness and the deteriorating economic outlook, real estate inflows in US dollar terms are likely to decline in 2019.
Determinants
Foreign investment is mostly motivated by the size and potential of the Turkish market, but also increasingly because it offers access to neighbouring markets. The sharp rise in FDI in 2005-07 was partly driven by favourable global financial conditions, which have since evaporated. However, the upsurge was also made possible by the conjunction of several country-specific factors. The 2001 financial crisis led to a new drive for reform and privatisation, and reforms in sectors such as energy, telecommunications and banking began to take hold. The Justice and Development Party (AKP; in power since 2002) was more willing than its predecessors to sell majority stakes in state-owned companies to foreigners, even in sectors previously considered "strategic". The economy was relatively stable and grew strongly, and EU accession talks, which were expected to lead to further reform of the business environment, got under way. The private sector was also more willing to seek foreign partners than in the past. This may have reflected the thinking of a new generation of management, strategies of specialisation in certain sectors, a desire to raise capital for privatisation bids, fear of increasing foreign competition, lost appetite for bank ownership and temptingly high company valuations. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an attempted military coup in July 2016 and increased social and political polarisation over the shift to a presidential system of government. Other significant structural deterrents, which vary by the sector, size and type of investment, include regulatory uncertainty, a slow and unpredictable judicial system, weak intellectual property (IP) protection and unfair competition from smuggled goods and the large informal sector.
Impact
The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is relatively low when compared with other emerging markets such as Brazil or Russia. However, FDI has accumulated over many decades, and the outlook compared with several central and east European countries has improved. Several leading multinationals, such as Unilever and Ford, have had a long-standing presence in Turkey, and companies with foreign partners play a significant role in the economy, helping to spread modern management and business practice. In the automotive industry, foreign investment has ensured expansion, technology transfer and access to global markets, although some lament the lack of national technology or a national trademark and the focus on production of low-end vehicles. By contrast, much recent FDI has taken the form of acquisitions of existing assets in domestically oriented sectors, and has therefore had a limited direct impact on fixed investment or exports. Foreign ownership of banks has not demonstrably improved either access to international funds or services and productivity, which were already advanced, and nor have fears been realised that foreign-owned banks may attach a greater risk premium than local banks to lending to the Turkish government or Turkish companies. The arrival of Vodafone has gradually helped to increase competition and investment in telecoms, where Turkcell and Turk Telekom are dominant players. From a macroeconomic perspective, Turkey has relied on capital inflows, including FDI, to cover its large external financing requirement. In the years prior to the 2008-09 crisis, a growing share of FDI in capital inflows comforted the financial markets by reducing the vulnerability of the lira to trends in short-term capital inflows. After having declined in recent years, we expect the ratio to improve during the forecast period, helped by smaller, albeit still large external financing needs.
Potential
Our baseline forecast is that, assuming security and policy concerns are addressed during the forecast period, there will be a moderate pick-up driven by further privatisation and other crossborder mergers and acquisitions, as well as foreign interest in residential and commercial property, following the easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in 2012. Although the surge in foreign acquisitions in telecoms and banking of 2006-07 is unrepeatable, private corporations in many sectors may still be open to foreign investment, and several major assets are yet to be privatised. We assume that the government will make further progress in creating conditions for private-sector investment in infrastructure. The energy sector in particular has the potential to attract large amounts of foreign investment. Existing investors are likely to increase their investment through further acquisitions or projects, and some greenfield investment may take place. Subdued income growth may dampen foreign investors' earlier interest in retailing, but they may also become more active in other services, such as tourism, as well as in mining and agriculture. Investors from Asia and parts of the Middle East may play a larger role, in addition to Western multinationals and funds.

Population growth remains high by European standards
Turkey is the third-largest country by population in Europe, after Russia and Germany. Official population figures have been compiled using an address-based registry since 2009. These figures are lower than previous estimates from door-to-door censuses, but are believed to be more reliable. The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 81.9m in 2018 to 85.4m in 2023, with the female population continuing to outnumber that of males. The total population is expected to grow by 0.8% per year during the forecast period (2019-23), compared with 1.6% during the historical period (2014-18). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of urbanisation, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards and average age remains one of the lowest, at 32 years.
Infant mortality rate will continue to decline, but will be high
From an average of 17 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2014-18, the crude birth rate is expected to fall to an average of 15.6 per 1,000 in 2019-23. The infant mortality rate will continue to decline, but will remain high compared with European countries, as the national average is pulled up by the south-eastern and eastern regions, as well as by rural areas. The crude death rate will remain broadly unchanged, at an average of 5.9 per 1,000 population in 2019-23.
Although ageing, the Turkish population is young in a European context and will remain so throughout the forecast period. In 2018 those aged 14 and under were estimated to comprise 24.6% of the total population, and the 65-plus age group accounted for just 8.4%. In 2023 the share of under-15s will still be high, at about 22.8% of the population, and over-65s are expected to account for 9.7%.
Urban population will rise further owing to better conditions in cities
The urban population, which is currently estimated at 75.2%, will rise further as rural families, insufficiently supported by agriculture, continue to seek better living standards in towns and cities. The drift of population from smaller and poorer urban settlements to larger and richer ones will also continue. As a result, all major cities in the west and south (including Ankara) will continue to grow rapidly. Although earthquake-prone, Istanbul and its surrounding area is likely to become the largest conurbation in Europe-the population was 15.1m at end-2018, up from about 12.6m at end-2007. Other cities and towns to witness particularly strong population growth include prosperous industrial centres like Bursa and Konya, and Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast.
The population of the mostly Kurdish-inhabited south east, which accounts for about 10% of the total population, has increased steadily, despite strong outward migration. The still-high natural population growth rate in the region will contribute to the rapid expansion of the populations of cities like Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. By contrast, the populations of many rural areas in northern, eastern and central Turkey will dwindle. Even some of the larger urban centres in these poorer and more remote regions could lose population as birth rates slow and migration westwards and southwards continues. Some western and southern areas that are still classed as rural may maintain their populations as a result of intensive agriculture, tourism and/or proximity to major cities. This may also be true of lowland parts of the south east benefiting from irrigation schemes.
Participation rates will remain well below the OECD average
Despite solid growth in the working-age population, Turkey has the lowest labour force participation rate of any OECD country. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), it averaged 53.2% in 2018 (72.7% for men and just 34.2% for women), compared with an OECD average rate of more than 70%. Participation rates in urban areas are lower than in rural areas, reflecting that rural women are typically classified as "unpaid family workers" and are, therefore, counted as workforce participants and employed persons. Low workforce participation rates among urban women probably reflect inadequate job opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender roles. This situation is changing slowly, as illustrated by a gradual rise in recent years in the urban female participation rate. However, the rate is expected to remain low by European standards throughout the forecast period.

Overall spending power will rise, but income distribution will remain uneven
The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. In 2018 GDP per head was US$9,333 at market exchange rates (down from US$10,510 in 2017, reflecting lira weakness in 2018) and US$29,132 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates (up from US$28,210 in 2017). Relative to other emerging markets, at PPP rates Turkey's GDP per head is broadly in line with that of Russia and Romania and above that of Brazil and China. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Turkey's GDP per head to be US$34,212 at PPP exchange rates in 2023. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be broadly unchanged as a percentage of the EU28 average, at about 63%.
Income distribution is uneven by European standards. According to the survey of incomes and living conditions by the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), the highest-earning 20% of households accounted for 47.4% of total income in 2017 (latest available data), up from 45.9% in 2014; the lowest-earning 20% of households accounted for 6.4%, in line with the 2014 figure. Geographical factors contributed to the discrepancies. In general, the regions with the highest and most rapidly growing concentrations of population were also the wealthiest regions-except in the south east, where spending power is low. Greater Istanbul, which accounts for about 20% of the population, represents about 25% of household consumption expenditure. By contrast, the statistical region of south-east Anatolia, with about 10% of the population, generated only 5.8% of household consumption. Income and consumer expenditure also vary widely between urban and rural areas, and within cities. These patterns are unlikely to change significantly in the forecast period (2019-23).
The household will remain the main consumption unit. Households typically consist of an average of 3.6 people, and more than 90% of households are made up of married couples. Although these patterns will change only gradually, the number of households will tend to increase faster than the population, underpinning medium-term demand for housing construction and household durables, including basics like furniture, washing machines and refrigerators.
Majority of Turkish consumers aspire to Western style consumer society
A large majority of Turkish consumers aspire to "Western style" consumer society, in so far as their incomes permit, although local factors affect lifestyle aspirations. Much of the population adheres to Islamic prohibitions, including on consumption of alcohol. The country has wide variations in geography and climate, which affect diet, leisure activities and demand for certain goods. Choices of entertainment vary between groups with different education levels.

Young population will encourage new products and services
The proportion of total household spending allocated to food, beverages and tobacco is high and expected to remain broadly stable during the forecast period. Housing and household fuel, goods and services will also remain major expenditure items. The wealthiest households, which enjoy standards of living close to those of west Europeans, spend significant amounts on entertainment, education and catering, as well as on transport, because of the high cost of running a car. These households will remain an important target market for environment-friendly and wellness products and services, which are relatively new. Other population segments are starting to provide additional demand for items that have been the prerogative of upper-income groups. Rising car ownership will continue to encourage supermarket shopping, residence in suburban areas and related lifestyle trends. Demand for branded fashion items, fast food, air conditioning and holidays is also spreading. That half of the population is under the age of 30 will encourage the introduction of new products and services in communications, information and entertainment technology. Tourists constitute a significant addition to the consumer market. About 55m, including both foreigners and non-resident Turks, visited Turkey in 2018, up from about 47m in 2017. Assuming that perceived security risk does not increase again in the coming years, we expect the weaker lira to boost arrivals further.

Initial conditions: Some of the obstacles to solid and stable growth were removed in the decade to 2010, but in recent years the government has focused on domestic power struggles and the foreign policy challenges arising from turmoil in the wider region, putting economic reforms designed to boost investment and employment on hold. Given the deterioration of Turkey's institutions of governance and the likelihood that the current domestic political tensions will continue for some time, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only limited progress on reforms in the near term, damaging Turkey's longer-term growth potential. For similar reasons, we do not expect Turkey's EU membership bid to make significant progress, making accession a remote prospect. A relatively low level of skills and quality of the workforce compared with Turkey's main competitors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in central and eastern Europe will continue to act as a deterrent to FDI, although Turkey will enjoy substantially more favourable demographics.
Working-age population growth turns negative in 2040
Demographic trends: On current projections, Turkey will have the second-largest national population in Europe (after Russia) by 2050, and, unlike in most European economies, Turkey's working-age population will continue to grow until the early 2040s. Nevertheless, Turkey's positive demographic dynamic is expected to start deteriorating from about 2030. In 2031-50 the difference between growth in the working-age population and that of the total population will become negative, which will dampen economic growth. This trend could be delayed if the bulk of 3.1m Syrian refugees currently being hosted in Turkey are integrated into the population.
Throughout the long-term forecast period, we expect an upward trend in the labour force and employment because of rises in participation rates, given the low starting levels. With the workforce continuing to expand at a steady rate, it will be a challenge to produce sufficient jobs to lower the unemployment rate substantially from an annual average of 12.4% in 2019-23.
External conditions: International developments-particularly in international financial markets, the EU (Turkey's main export market) and in global terms of trade-will continue to affect Turkey's long-term economic performance. With export-led industries playing an increasing role in growth, Turkey would benefit from greater global trade liberalisation, but the process of liberalisation is faltering and trade flows have slowed. As a supplier of the developed economies, Turkey will continue to face intense international competition, as low and medium value-added manufactured goods are likely to remain its main product lines. Its technology potential is relatively limited, and the country is not well placed to become a major supplier of services other than tourism and, to a lesser extent, construction, although improvements in (and diversification of) the domestic financial sector over the past decade may enable Turkey to develop as a provider of banking and insurance services in the wider region. Because of completed and planned pipeline construction, Turkey is expected to become a major energy hub between Russia, the Caspian region and western Europe. As Turkey shares borders with countries like Iran, Syria and Iraq, its immediate regional environment is challenging, in particular from a security perspective.
Problems in EU will dampen Turkey's interest in membership
We do not expect Turkey to join the EU, and there is a high probability that the accession negotiations may even be abandoned by one or both sides during the long-term forecast period. Given the limited progress so far in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the strength of public opposition in most EU member states to Turkish membership and the economic and political challenges still facing the EU, we believe that Turkey's commitment to the goal of full EU membership will diminish even further. This increases the risk that government commitment to political and economic reform will weaken further. Harmonisation of Turkey's domestic legislation with EU norms is significantly more important for Turkey's long-term economic stability than actual membership. If the EU were to loosen its structure-the UK's vote to leave the EU could prompt such a move-opposition in the EU to Turkish accession might ease, increasing Turkey's chances of joining. However, this is not our core scenario.
Institutions and policy trends: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's victory in Turkey's first direct election of the president in August 2014, the approval of his presidential reform plan in a referendum in April 2017 and the presidential election of 2018 have shifted the political system from a parliamentary to a presidential system. The shift carries major implications for the country's future institutional and policy-setting framework. The constitutional reform allows Mr Erdogan to run for president for two five-year terms, which means that he is likely to be in power until 2028. Beyond that, assuming that the constitution is not amended further to allow him to run for a third term, which cannot be ruled out, the issue of his succession as leader of the AKP and president of the country could become a source of instability during the long-term forecast period.
Considerable risk that economic policy is increasingly political
The broadly positive management of the economy by the AKP since coming to power in 2002 has been one of the main reasons for its electoral successes. However, there is a considerable risk that economic policy will be increasingly tailored to political purposes rather than to maintain macroeconomic stability and further improvement of the business environment. Nevertheless, Turkey's public finances are structurally sounder following a decade of IMF-backed reforms in 1999-2008, which may allow the government more room to increase public investment in infrastructure and possibly to reduce tax rates further, if solid economic growth is sustained. Given the little progress that we expect to be made in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the problems of unpredictability and inefficiency in Turkey's domestic legal and regulatory environment are expected to continue beyond 2023. Legislation is likely to remain under the scrutiny of the EU and other international bodies, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, although Mr Erdogan's assertive and increasingly personalised approach to foreign relations is likely to limit their influence over the direction of policies.
The government's peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed following the June 2015 election, and neither the PKK nor Mr Erdogan have shown any indication that they are willing to revive them any time soon. If the situation continues on its current trajectory, there is a real risk that the PKK and its affiliates will spread the conflict from the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited south east of the country to Turkey's main cities in central and western regions, where the Kurdish population has grown rapidly in recent years. The mounting death toll will probably encourage Mr Erdogan to resort to increasingly authoritarian means to retain control.
Long-term performance: Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to exceed that of other emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia (but to be on a par with that of China) as a result of its more favourable demographic profile alongside large productivity increases. However, at an average of 2.9% a year in 2019-50, real GDP growth will be well below that recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU28 average, but some catch-up is likely. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but the changes in the political environment have created significant downside risks to the implementation of the necessary reforms.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Global land and ocean temperatures have been rising briskly since the 1980s, a trend that is widely attributed to growing greenhouse gas emissions from expanding human activity and population. In the coming decades the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East region will be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Energy, Environment and Water Research Centre (EEWRC) of the Cyprus Institute, a non-profit research institute, expects average temperatures in the broad region to increase by 3-5°C by 2050. This is a sharp acceleration in atmospheric warming compared with a 1-2°C rise in average temperatures from 1892 to 2010. This rise in average temperatures implies a higher number of extremely hot days in the summer period, as well as higher minimum temperatures that will lead to greater electricity consumption and a heavier burden on health services due to temperature-related illnesses and parasitic diseases that thrive in warmer climates.
Precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean has been declining steadily over the past decades and is expected to continue falling, raising the probability of extremely dry spells of weather. From 1998 to 2012 the eastern Mediterranean Levant (Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey) experienced the worst drought in 900 years. In Turkey, in 2007 this resulted in water restrictions being imposed in Ankara, the capital, with some residents losing access for up to ten days. It also resulted in Turkey's agricultural output contracting by nearly 7% year on year and the government having to provide grants to affected farmers to compensate for the losses. In the future limited average rainfall is likely to be accompanied by torrential precipitation such as that in the first half of 2018 and early 2019, with devastating consequences for infrastructure and agricultural output.
The Turkish government has recently taken some steps to mitigate the weakness posed by the country's geographical location. In 2010 the government established a national climate change strategy that included improved disaster mitigation plans and improved efficiency in water management. Specifically, a substantial number of dams have been built, and efforts have been made to improve some of the highly inefficient irrigation and water supply systems. Although such measures may help to mitigate the effects of climate change, they may also create foreign policy challenges. The construction of several damns along the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, which feed water into Iraq and Syria, has the potential to increase significantly tensions with these neighbouring countries. This year we have developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we expect that, despite the mitigation efforts, real GDP will be 2.8% smaller by 2050 than it would have otherwise been.
Technological development
The integration of advanced technologies in Turkey's economy is proceeding at a fast pace, yet from a relatively low base. E-commerce, computer ownership and internet access have increased rapidly in the past decade. Yet, despite this progress, Turkey remains far behind the technological frontier. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Rankings, Turkey ranks joint 50th with Greece, Thailand and Costa Rica in the global rankings for technological readiness. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2018, Turkey ranks 53rd overall, but 71st in terms of information and communications technology (ICT) adoption, which includes criteria such as the percentage of internet users. The country ranks 47th in innovation capability, largely owing to its ranking of 19th place in the quality of research institutions sub-category.
Across sectors, large, export-oriented private-sector firms tend to be the most technologically intensive. Firms in the automotive sector, usually structured as joint partnerships between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, are a major driver of research and development (R&D) expenditure. Ford Otosan, the joint venture of Ford, a US-based car manufacturer, in Turkey has become a global hub for Ford's commercial vehicle development and output. In 2015 the company opened a US$25m R&D unit-Turkey's largest, employing about 1,500 engineers. Oyak-Renault, a joint venture between Renault, a French car manufacturer, and Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund, won government financial support worth US$100m to support hybrid investments at its Bursa plant.
Turkey's technological prospects are unclear. The country has a young, dynamic labour pool, but Turkey's education system is inadequate at providing the skills demanded by employers. In fact, this is regularly one of businesses' top complaints. In addition, in recent years many of Turkey's most educated young people have emigrated abroad, which will make attracting top foreign talent and further foreign direct investment (FDI) more difficult.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Argentina--highlights: Political outlook
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition government will come under increasing political pressure amid popular frustration with the weak state of the economy, extremely high inflation and bouts of currency volatility. As the presidential election to be held on October 27th dominates the political scene, the reform agenda of the president, Mauricio Macri, will be put on the back burner. The government will instead shift its focus to issues such as tackling public insecurity and fighting corruption, which are major concerns for the electorate. Nonetheless, Mr Macri's re-election prospects will depend crucially on the extent to which economic recovery filters down to voters by October. In this context, there are significant risks to The Economist Intelligence Unit's assumption that Mr Macri will win a second term and that liberalisation reforms will gather pace later in our 2019-23 forecast period. The victory of a moderate Peronist, such as Roberto Lavagna, would likely see orthodox policy continue. However, if the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007 15) were to win, we would expect a return to the statist policies of the past.

Argentina's position in our business environment rankings improves sharply between the historical and forecast periods. The Macri government has made progress on ironing out distortions, which, although contributing to high inflation in the short term, will improve the business environment, assuming policy continuity after the 2019 election cycle. The scope for near-term improvements is minimal, with economic volatility forcing the government to back-pedal in some areas. We assume that this is temporary and that renewed progress on the reform front is likely later in the forecast period. A victory by Ms Fernández de Kirchner would pose a significant threat to our projections, with the business environment likely to deteriorate sharply in that case.

Economic recovery from last year's currency crisis is struggling to gain momentum amid extremely tight fiscal and monetary policy. Therefore, although we expect improvements in sequential terms, the recovery is likely to be weak and uneven, producing a negative GDP growth outturn of 1.1% in 2019. Although we expect a moderate pick-up in 2020-23, to above 3%, this would be contingent upon the continued implementation of orthodox economic policy and the pursuance of deep structural reforms.

Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average, although it will be outpaced by growth in the labour force in the outlook period. An ageing population will place a heavy demand on healthcare services, which require significant reform. The effects of this decline will be lasting, but relatively high skills levels mean that the stock of human capital will, nonetheless, remain a source of comparative advantage, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will narrow the gap between Argentina and much of the rest of the region.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, a large domestic market with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region, and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors (assuming that the Brazilian economy recovers gradually). However, economic adjustments to rein in inflation will deter investment in the very short term, at least as businesses wait on the sidelines while Mr Macri pushes through the necessary-but politically and socially difficult-adjustments.

Our forecast for annual average GDP growth of 2.5% in 2019-50 assumes that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm in the first part of the forecast period, before tapering off somewhat. We also assume that, as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign investment. Although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and failure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of the centre-left government and a deep economic crisis. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to secure the presidency in 2007 and re-election in 2011. Economic mismanagement drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015. Turbulent external conditions have forced Mr Macri to undertake sharp policy tightening and implement a slate of emergency economic measures. Furthers bouts of instability will present a risk to Mr Macri's re-election prospects.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house), but in practice the presidency dominates. The 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district each have their own governments.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to average GDP growth of 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad-hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce distortions are now taking place, under the auspices of an IMF lending arrangement, involving extremely tight fiscal targets. However, market confidence has been shaky amid increased political risk, and bouts of currency turbulence have persisted. High political risk has forced the government to expand price controls and increase export taxes, but these measures are expected to be only temporary.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate was scheduled to fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021, but this schedule of cuts may be pushed back amid fiscal difficulties. A temporary tax on exports of Ps3-4 per dollar of exports is set to last until end-2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions.
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2018 the deficit had reached 5.4% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The president, Mauricio Macri, took office on December 10th 2015 for a four-year term ending in December 2019. Mr Macri was elected on the ticket of the Cambiemos electoral alliance. This alliance includes Mr Macri's own party, the centre-right Propuesta Repúblicana (Pro), along with the centrist Unión Cívica Radical and the smaller left-wing Coalición Cívica. Mr Macri's party is in a minority both in the Senate (the upper house of Congress) and the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Following a good performance in mid-term elections in October 2017, Cambiemos has a plurality of seats in the lower house. In the Senate, various moderate factions of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) hold the largest number of seats, followed by Cambiemos. The government relies on support from moderate Peronists to pass legislation.

Political outlook: Political stability
The presidential election to be held on October 27th 2019 is starting to dominate the political scene and will put the government in full campaign mode as the president, Mauricio Macri, seeks to secure re-election for a second four-year term. This re-election bid is under threat from increasing popular unease with the state of the economy, and in particular the continuing upward drift of inflation, cripplingly high interest rates, and bouts of peso volatility in a country with a history of currency crisis and an unusual sensitivity to exchange-rate movements. In the face of these problems, Mr Macri will not back down from his commitment to austerity, and continues to present it as Argentina's path to eventual economic stability, but it is an increasingly tough sell.
Recognising this, the government has, within its limited room for manoeuvre, attempted to signal its support to consumers with a number of measures, such as a temporary price freeze, an early increase in the minimum wage and a rise in benefits for conditional cash transfer recipients. For small business, new subsidised credits have been announced and there is a possibility of some sort of tax relief (all while large exporters and importers continue to face temporary taxes and tariffs). The government has also tried to ease labour relations, and may well give way on wage negotiations in the lead-up to the election. All of this, under The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast, will help to contain social unrest, but even so, the risk of instability remains significant in a country with a well-established tradition of political protest, vocal labour unions, an upcoming election and collective wage-bargaining rounds getting into full swing.
Given all these difficulties, policy gridlock will persist in the short term. The government made good initial progress on its policy agenda, enacting tax, pension and competition reforms in 2017. However, the government's structural reform agenda has been on the back burner ever since the start of last year's currency crisis, and will remain so in the run-up to the October election. For now, on the assumption that Mr Macri is successful in steering the economy through difficult waters and secures a second term of office, we expect that later in its forecast period there will be a renewed emphasis on much-needed reforms to: increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effectiveness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights, which will start to lay the groundwork for more solid long-term growth rates. However, this is a benign assumption, and the policy outlook would not be as positive under a new government (which would presumably come from the opposition Peronist party).
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
A concentration of power in the executive helps to speed progress on the government agenda, but results in a lack of transparency in decision making. The trend towards a concentration of power in the executive has occurred ever since the 2001-02 economic crisis, at which point extraordinary powers were given to the president to expedite policymaking. Mr Macri has periodically used decree powers to push through policy measures and political appointments, particularly when Congress is in recess. Like his predecessors, the president also relies on transfers to the provinces to secure the support of powerful regional governors for his agenda. To a significant extent, governors control the voting positions of senators in their provinces.
Although Mr Macri may be more likely to pursue them than his predecessor, reforms that would successfully address longstanding institutional weaknesses and strengthen the bureaucracy will prove politically difficult. The permanent state bureaucracy is made up mainly of low-paid clerical jobs. The professionals responsible for designing and implementing policy are appointed on short-term contracts, which are renewed with each change of government (or even minister).
Reforms to improve the legal system are required
Reforms are required to improve the legal system, which has for decades been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Under the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), the courts resisted pressure to side with the government; the Supreme Court ultimately declared that a legal reform threatening judicial independence was unconstitutional, ensuring that the law (which had been passed by a razor-thin margin in Congress) did not come into effect. The presence of a non-Peronist executive provides some opportunity for a new judicial reform proposal that addresses the problems of corruption and inefficiency in the judiciary (there has been a historic tendency for executive-branch overreach among Peronists). Significantly, upon taking office Mr Macri quickly filled two vacant seats on the Supreme Court with candidates viewed as highly qualified and unbiased. However, we are not optimistic about significant reform measures being taken in the short term, given that Mr Macri is likely to continue working from a minority position in Congress. Without a strengthening of the legal system, it will be difficult to address the problem of corruption in government. A number of investigations into members of the Fernández government are under way, but voters have complained of a lack of convictions.
Political outlook: Election watch
We continue to believe that Mr Macri will be re-elected in the presidential election on October 27th, but there are large and growing risks to this assumption and the race will be close. It will hinge on the president's ability to convince voters that he can steer them on a path towards economic stability and prosperity after last year's crisis derailed the government's agenda and hit the president's opinion poll ratings hard. The latest opinion polls show that the race is extremely tight, with some polls showing the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), slightly ahead of Mr Macri. Corruption allegations continue to swirl around Ms Fernández, stemming from her time as president, and although she has a loyal base of core supporters of close to 30%, she also has extremely high negative ratings, which would make it hard for her to win in an eventual second-round run-off.
Although Mr Macri and Ms Fernández are currently dominating the race, other players with a shot at the presidency could yet emerge. In particular, the unification of the Peronist party around a single, centrist candidate could undermine both Mr Macri's and Ms Fernández's chances. Potential Peronist candidates such as Sergio Massa, a former congressman who was third in the 2015 race, and the Salta governor, Juan Manuel Urtubey, are all likely to be in the mix, although so far none of them has aroused much enthusiasm among voters. Another party heavyweight, Roberto Lavagna (a former economy minister who led Argentina's 2005 debt restructuring), is also contemplating a run, and does appear to have momentum. However, it is unclear if he will run, or if he would in fact succeed in unifying all the centrists vying for the presidency around his campaign.
In our view, although issues such as corruption and security will be important, the outcome of the race will depend crucially on the state of the economy, and on signs that the effects of economic recovery are being felt by voters. We assume that these signals of improvement will be evident by October, and therefore expect Mr Macri to be in a position to win. However, if the recovery is yet to filter down to the population, the race will be much closer, leaving the door open for Ms Fernández or a moderate Peronist such as Mr Lavagna.
Political outlook: International relations
Mr Macri has made considerable efforts to mend relations with investors and seek trade and investment commitments from key international partners during his time in office. These efforts, combined with policy reforms, have produced results, most obviously in the strong IMF backing of Argentina's adjustment programme. However, a recent currency crisis means that key foreign policy priorities, such as the expansion of free trade and regional integration, will for now take a back seat to emergency adjustment measures. Relations with Brazil will be under the spotlight following the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president in that country; we do not currently expect a return to trade conflict or protectionism on the part of Brazil, but the chance of greater bilateral economic co-operation may be diminished by the Bolsonaro administration's focus lying elsewhere.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business rankings measure the quality and attractiveness of the investment environment in 82 of the world's largest economies, including 12 in Latin America. Argentina makes a large improvement in the overall rankings between the historical (2014-18) and forecast (2019-23) periods. Partly, Argentina's improvement is a legacy of the change of government at the end of 2015, which saw a subsequent change in the years that followed away from expansionary and distortionary macroeconomic policies, along with efforts to improve the legal and regulatory framework, and promote trade and investment. The impact of these changes will be felt during the forecast period. The president, Mauricio Macri, has made strides in rolling back the distortions that characterised the previous government's tenure, resulting in a sharp improvement in the component scores across virtually every area of the business environment. That said, there is limited scope for further improvements to the business environment in the short term.

Recent economic volatility has forced the government to extend price controls, postpone a planned roll-back of subsidies and expand export taxes, while greater reticence on the part of investors and difficulties in securing finance are also evident. Our forecasts are based on the assumption that this will prove temporary, with greater political and economic certainty from 2020 allowing the authorities scope to roll back recently introduced measures. However, uncertainty about the outcome of the October 2019 general election poses risks to our currently benign projections. We assume that Mr Macri will secure another term in office, providing broad policy continuity, but if the previous president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15) wins the election, there would be a sharp deterioration in the business environment, as we assume that her policy stance would be much less investor-friendly.

The macroeconomic environment will improve but remain weak
Despite a forecast improvement in Argentina's score and ranking between the historical and forecast period, the macroeconomic environment will be the weakest area of our business environment rankings (BER) during 2019-23. During 2014-18, the macroeconomic environment was one of the worst in all of the 82 countries covered in our BER. This was the legacy of heterodox policy measures introduced by the last government, led by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), which hampered the quality of policymaking and actual performance, both during her tenure and in the years following her departure from office.
Overall, the macroeconomic environment is forecast to improve during 2019-23, but certain areas (in particular relating to inflation, the exchange rate and public debt) will remain weak and will prevent a more marked consolidation of Argentina's score and ranking in this category. The main areas of the macroeconomic environment that register a notable improvement in the forecast period is the quality of policymaking and strength of institutions, as the current government's policy stance is much more investor-friendly than that of his predecessor.
We also expect some improvements in performance indicators over the course of 2019-23, with the fiscal deficit forecast to narrow moderately and the current account expected to shift from deficit to surplus. However, the pace of improvement will be relatively gradual and a challenging monetary situation-characterised by high, albeit decelerating, inflation and sporadic chronic currency volatility-will hamper the economy's medium-term growth potential and constrain the government's policy choices. We currently assume no marked deviation from the government's market-friendly stance, but should Ms Fernández win office again in the October general election, the macroeconomic environment would be likely to deteriorate once again.

The economy will benefit from the return to a market-friendly policy stance
Argentina's score and ranking for private enterprise and competition improves substantially for the 2019-23 forecast period, under our assumption that the Macri government will continue to introduce measures that actively encourage private investment and promote competition. The Fernández government had a track record of arbitrary decision-making that was often detrimental to the private sector, eroding confidence in the legal framework, hampering the freedom of businesses to compete and giving rise to allegations of crony capitalism. During the forecast period, we expect a revamped competition commission to focus on more rapid and thorough enforcement of antitrust violations. Across the public sector, a reduction in red tape is likely; legislation reducing red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was approved in 2017. Although the government has announced a number of policy measures in response to surging inflation, including price controls on some basic consumption items, higher export taxes and the suspension of utility tariff adjustments, we believe that these measures will prove temporary and in the medium term the authorities will remain committed to scaling back price controls and subsidies. Overall efforts will continue to be affected by lobbying by special interest groups in the context of Argentina's long tradition of political clientelism, but we expect significant improvements in all of these areas by the end of the forecast period. That said, state participation in key sectors, including energy, utilities and banking, is expected to continue.
Under Ms Fernández, the Comisión Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia (CNDC, the competition authority) was a weak and ineffective body, doing little to prevent monopolistic practices or protect consumer rights. This is changing under Mr Macri. He appointed a new head of the CNDC in 2016, Esteban Greco, who focused immediately on crafting a reform of the existing competition legislation. The reform, which was entered into effect in May 2018, transforms the CNDC into an independent body (the Autoridad Nacional de la Competencia), tightens penalties for companies found guilty of competition-related offences, improves controls on mergers and acquisitions, encourages greater disclosure and creates an under-secretariat responsible for investigation, training and education. Closer co-operation with US competition authorities to train staff on mergers and acquisitions will also raise standards in this area. Currently, the competition authority has scare resources, which will hamper the number of anti-trust investigations that it can conduct simultaneously, but this is expected to improve over the course of the forecast period.
Policy towards export taxes and agricultural quotas has oscillated somewhat in recent years. The Macri government took office pledging to scale these back, eliminating export taxes on wheat, beef and corn, while also reducing the tax on soybeans-the most important export crop-on a rolling monthly basis, from an initial level of 35% to 25.5% by mid-2018. However, the policy stance shifted in September 2018, with the government announcing a new generalised export tax of Ps4 on each US dollar of revenue for primary and services exporters, and Ps3 per US dollar for all other exports. Mr Macri has emphasised that generalised export taxes run contrary to his free-market policies, but that his government has run out of options in the context of broader fiscal challenges. The export tax was partially offset by conciliatory measures in other areas, with the export tax on soybeans reduced from 25.5% to 18%. Given that the authorities are counting on an export-led economic recovery, the generalised export tax is unlikely to remain in place throughout the entire forecast period.
We expect the process of scaling back price controls on consumer goods to remain on hold in the short term, before recommencing in the medium term. Upon taking office, the government kept a price-control programme, Precios Cuidados, in place, as it sought to curb the pass-through effect on inflation of currency devaluation, but it reduced the number of basic consumer items covered from 500 to 317. However, since then, a number of new products have been added to the list, with 560 products now covered, in response to rising inflation. In addition, in April 2019 the government reached an agreement with 16 leading suppliers to freeze the prices of 60 basic consumption items (including oils, flour, sugar, milk, beverages and canned food) for a period of six months. Renewed efforts to reduce price controls on consumer goods are unlikely until inflation begins to subside.
There was initially more progress on efforts to scale back government energy subsidies by raising electricity and natural gas tariffs, but recent economic difficulties will also affect the pace at which the authorities can continue to reduce these subsidies. After taking office, the government introduced hefty price increases for end-users, with gas bills jumping massively (albeit from an extremely low base), despite considerable domestic opposition. The authorities were aiming to align domestic rates with market rates by the end of 2019, but the rise in rates has generated significant public opposition, particularly in the context of rising inflation, and this timetable has slipped. In April 2019, the government suspended planned hikes in utility rates for the second quarter; similarly hikes in the second half of the year will be shelved. Electricity-rate hikes that had been scheduled for May and September will also be suspended. Despite these moves, we believe that the government remains committed to realigning utility tariffs once inflation has subsided. The government is likely to grant companies new subsidies to compensate for the lower prices.

Foreign investment to pick up
Argentina's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment improve significantly between the historical and forecast period. This reflects Mr Macri's much more welcoming stance towards foreign capital and his efforts to make government policy towards foreign investment more transparent, clear and predictable. The sovereign's exit from default in April 2017 lifted a major constraint on foreign investment by reopening access to investment protection schemes (a key factor driving the increase in Argentina's score in this category for 2019-23). The government's more market-friendly approach means that the risk of expropriations is much lower, and government favouritism of domestic firms will be less marked. However, aside from occasional sales of some state-owned assets, we expect outright privatisation to remain off the agenda. The public still places much of the blame for the 2001-02 crisis on the privatisation process of the 1990s, in which foreign firms featured heavily.
Argentina's exit from default has facilitated access to capital markets, but the government's ambitious plans for infrastructure and housing development will still necessitate foreign participation in the context of fiscal expenditure constraints. Beneficially, a bill establishing a public-private partnership (PPP) framework for investment was signed into law in December 2016. However, official estimates that it could raise potential capital inflows by US$90bn are likely to prove extremely optimistic. In the short term, investment under PPP schemes will move very gradually. In January 2019 the government had initially suspended issuances of new tenders under PPP schemes owing to the country's high risk premium (which has boosted external borrowing costs and strained projects' financial feasibility). However, in early March the government once again floated a tender for the construction and operation of a 487-km high-voltage electricity network, through a 15-year PPP contract. The latest development bodes well for the investment outlook, even in a context of relatively high economic volatility.
In the medium term, energy reforms to liberalise tariffs and promote investment are likely to boost multinational interest in deals to commercialise Argentina's vast shale oil and gas reserves (the world's second-largest), particularly now that international energy prices have risen moderately from the 2015-16 lows. The Fernández government expropriated oil producer YPF in 2012 and paid heavy subsidies to suppress domestic petrol prices, with investment falling sharply as a result. Since then, the official policy stance has changed and YPF has signed a series of exploration and production (E&P) contracts with private-sector companies to develop the Vaca Muerta shale deposits in Neuquén province. The development of Vaca Muerta has been progressing slowly (even though the break-even price needed to make investment profitable is low, at US$35-40/barrel), because of the vast scale of the investment needed and the lack of local infrastructure. The government is seeking to boost investment in the energy sector by developing other areas, offering significant deepwater exploration contracts in the Austral (5,000 sq km), Western Malvinas (90,000 sq km) and North Argentina (130,000 sq km) basins. The last two are generally unexplored, while the Austral Basin is known largely as an offshore gas play. The first licensing round for these blocks was held in April, attracting bids from a large number of international oil majors.

Trade barriers remain high, but fresh capital controls are unlikely
Notwithstanding some modest improvements during 2019-23, foreign trade and exchange controls will remain a weak point of the investment climate, relative to other areas of the business environment. Trade restrictions remain high, with Argentina currently holding free-trade agreements (FTAs) with relatively few countries (accounting for only around 10% of global GDP, compared with levels of 70-80% in Chile and Peru). Under Mercosur, external tariffs on non-Mercosur trade stand at 9% for capital goods and 6% for intermediate goods. Meanwhile, non-tariff barriers to trade are high; according to World Bank data these apply to 95% of imports (above the global average of 72%) and 76% of exports (much higher than the global average of 27%). Non-tariff barriers to trade mainly take the form of export and import taxes, registration requirements, as well as trading bans on certain items. Nonetheless, the currency devaluation in 2018, accompanied by productivity-enhancing reforms during the forecast period, will significantly improve export competitiveness and help to produce much-needed adjustment on Argentina's current account. Despite vulnerabilities to external shocks, the government will refrain from putting in place outright capital controls. We expect the monetary authorities to continue to respond with conventional tools, rather than the re-imposition of controls.
On-off free-trade negotiations between the EU and Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) have been ongoing since 2000. Five negotiating rounds took place and one has so far been completed in 2019 (in March). During 2018, officials had hinted that the two sides were close to reaching a deal, reflecting greater consensus on several significant obstacles that have long hampered talks, including treatment of agricultural products. However, work is still required on key outstanding issues, which include market access in Mercosur for cars and car parts. In addition, there is greater uncertainty about prospects for finalising a deal under the new Brazilian government, led by Jair Bolsonaro. Our forecasts do not currently assume that the FTA will be signed and implemented within the forecast period, but there is some upside risk to this assumption. Meanwhile, Mr Macri is also likely to continue to focus on expanding relations with the Pacific Alliance, a trade bloc comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, as well as Asia.

Tax reform is likely to address long-running deficiencies at a fundamental level
The tax system is one of the areas of the business environment in which Argentina registers the most significant improvements between the historical and forecast periods. The approval of a comprehensive tax reform bill in December 2017 is the main factor explaining the improvement. During the historical period, Argentina's score in this area was dragged down by a high level of corporate tax (35%-one of the highest in the region), significant complexity (over 35 different types of tax were collected), as well as a series of distortionary taxes (including agricultural export taxes, a financial transactions tax and a gross turnover tax). The tax reform addressed several of these long-running weaknesses; we expect that it will help to create a more equitable and efficient tax system that supports investment and encourages formal employment. Although we expect further improvements to the tax regime-to improve compliance and to reduce tax disincentives-the government is unlikely to pass reforms that are not revenue-neutral (so as to ensure fiscal consolidation continues apace).
The tax reform was designed to boost investment. The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 30% in 2018 and it will be cut again to 25% from 2020 as long as profits are reinvested (if they are not, a 10% tax on distribution of dividends will be applied). The reform also set a tax-free threshold for payroll tax in order to encourage formal-sector employment, introduced gradually over the course of 2019-23. The counterpart of these tax cuts is an increase in some consumption taxes (including adjustments to excise taxes to make them more progressive) and the introduction of a new capital gains tax. The latter is set at a rate of 15% for dollar-denominated financial assets and inflation-linked assets, and falls to 5% for non-inflation-linked, peso-denominated financial assets. Financial assets include corporate and public bonds, central bank notes, and banks' long-term deposits. There will be a tax-free threshold of Ps52,000 (US$3,000). The government has opted to maintain the financial transactions tax (which it had initially wanted to phase out) until 2022, partly to compensate for lost revenue.
Improvements to the system of revenue-sharing with the provinces are also expected in 2019-23. Along with tax reform and the budget, Congress also passed a provincial fiscal responsibility law and so-called provincial "fiscal pact". Together, the measures will secure the commitment of the provinces to restraint in spending and tax pressure, and to the reduction of distortionary taxes. It will also put an end to lawsuits by the provinces related to the transfers of federal government revenue and lays out a series of changes to this system of transfers, called "co-participation", a reform that was attractive to provincial governors and the legislators that are influenced by them.
The Macri government has passed several tax measures to improve conditions for SMEs that have been particularly badly hit by deteriorating economic conditions. Since the start of 2017, SMEs have been exempt from the minimum notional income tax levied on companies' assets. This tax accounts for a very small share of total tax revenue (well under 1%), but is burdensome for SMEs (particularly for manufacturing companies who generally have more assets in the form of equipment than service providers), as it must be paid even in the event of losses. In addition, SMEs are now able to offset bank debit and credit tax against income tax. SMEs are also able to pay value-added tax (VAT) on sales every three months rather than monthly, which will assist with cashflow. Finally, to encourage investment, the law offsets up to 10% of new investment in capital goods and infrastructure against income tax.

Argentina's score and ranking for financing improve sharply between the historical and the forecast periods. For the most part, this reflects the huge constraints on finance in place during the first half of the historical period, which resulted from continued sovereign default. Argentina's deal with holdout creditors and exit from default paved the way for much-improved access to external credit for corporate borrowers. That said, ongoing macroeconomic volatility will hamper the availability of long-term finance domestically, at least in the short term. Large foreign companies will, therefore, have to secure most of their financing needs from external sources. Banking sector regulation and supervision are expected to improve, while financial soundness and profitability indicators will remain solid. However, some weaknesses in the system will persist: notwithstanding an improvement, financial markets will remain relatively shallow by comparison with similarly ranked peers, as will levels of banking penetration.
Argentina's particularly weak score and ranking in the historical period is explained by several factors. Apart from the fact that the sovereign remained in default for part of the historical period, these included the nationalisation of private pension funds in 2008, which was a serious blow to the funds' growth and had a lasting impact in the following years. Argentina's private pension-fund administrators were the country's most important institutional investors and were a growing source of finance in the local capital markets. The Administración Nacional de Seguridad Social (Anses, the social security agency, which took over the nationalised pension fund assets) was able to allocate up to 50% of assets in local private companies' shares and up to 10% of assets in foreign government securities.
A capital markets reform passed in May 2018 is likely to improve financing conditions in two main ways: by facilitating access to credit for SMEs and by boosting the mortgage market. A new electronic credit invoice system will improve access to credit and also improve the risk rating of SMEs that supply big companies. The reform also establishes the conditions for the creation of a market to securitise mortgage loans, a development that will require increased supervision, particularly of inflation-indexed mortgages.

Labour market reforms are unlikely
The labour market is the only area of the business environment in which we expect stagnation in Argentina's underlying score between the historical and forecast periods, with Argentina's global ranking slipping by four places. The labour force is well-educated, productive and flexible, and labour costs are relatively competitive by international standards (the latter largely resulting from peso devaluation in 2018, which helped unwind years of real peso appreciation). That being said, we do not expect significant progress on labour market reform, or in addressing a highly unionised labour market that produces a high incidence of strikes. In the short term, difficult economic adjustments that are contributing to a decline in real wages and a cut in purchasing power will result in continued frequent strikes, particularly as the government seeks to rein in wage increases against the backdrop of extremely high levels of inflation.
The passage of comprehensive labour reform is unlikely during 2019-23, given weak relations between the government and organised labour. Mr Macri has effectively shelved plans for a broad-based reform bill, instead choosing to focus on only one aspect-an amnesty for employers who register informal workers. The government is likely to submit a bill to encourage labour formalisation by forgiving fines due by employers for having informal workers, as long as they have formalised the employees' contracts. However, even by the government's estimates, the measure would be likely to lead to the incorporation of only around 200,000 of the country's 4.5m informal workers into formal labour markets (and potentially far fewer). As such, these measures are unlikely to boost Argentina's score in this area over the course of the forecast period.
Skills shortages and mismatches remain a problem, compounded by a lack of effective training programmes in both the public and private sectors. Secondary and tertiary enrolment are very high by regional standards, but educational outcomes are not as strong as would be expected given high enrolment rates, and vary widely by province. At the same time, access to job training tends to be unequal and informal. We do not expect any significant improvement in these areas during the forecast period.

More private investment will help to upgrade infrastructure
Argentina's score and ranking for infrastructure improve moderately between the historical and forecast periods, remaining one of the stronger areas of the country's business environment. The country boasts a well-developed telecommunications network, as well as relatively low property rental costs. However, physical infrastructure has suffered over the past decade from a lack of investment. Although recent political and economic uncertainty will hamper investment in infrastructure in the near term, we currently assume that the passage of PPP legislation and improvements in contract rights will help to boost investment both in transport infrastructure and energy in the medium term. However, such projects will take time to come on stream, limiting further improvement to the score in 2019-23, and raising the risk that infrastructure bottlenecks will continue to hamper growth in the meantime.
The risk of energy shortages will persist in the short term at least, given long project completion times. Demand for electricity and gas has soared in the past decade, but as tariffs for residential and business consumers are lifted, demand growth is expected to slow. Talks are ongoing between the Argentinian and Chinese authorities over the construction of a nuclear reactor in Argentina, but, apart from this, prospects for fresh construction in the energy sector are less certain. Despite Argentina's vast hydroelectric potential, no further large projects are under way. The government has undertaken auctions in the renewable sector since 2017, under its RenovAR project, but progress remains slow, as firms have reportedly found it virtually impossible to secure local financing for renewables projects amid the economy's difficulties. Even assuming greater progress in the medium term, successful auctions are unlikely to translate into new capacity until late in the forecast period (or even after). In the short term at least, the lack of new energy capacity coming on stream will maintain dependence on imports, and increase exposure to weather-related problems at existing hydropower facilities.
Although the mobile telecoms market has matured in recent years, there remains scope for development in the quality and scope of mobile-telecoms services. Although substantial investments have been announced by telecoms companies, whether these materialise (thereby resulting in noticeable improvements during the forecast period) will partly depend on the ability of the government to draft and pass a new communications law to improve competition and operating conditions. The bill is unlikely to be submitted to the legislature in the short term owing to political and economic constraints, but we expect progress in the medium term, as the reform measures are relatively uncontroversial. Broadband penetration is the highest in Latin America, owing to high per-head income and strong competition, which has kept subscription fees low and the quality of service high. 4G coverage is among the highest in the region, with the government targeting 93% coverage by the end of 2019 and 100% coverage by the end of 2020.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Argentina registers one of its highest scores in this area of the business environment, and although it is only mid-ranked by global comparison, it is the highest-ranked in Latin America, after Chile. High levels of mobile subscriptions and broadband penetration underpin the score, given that they are critical to driving broader technological developments including mobile apps and cloud computing, which in turn helps to drive economic growth across a variety of sectors and facilitate an increase in productivity. However, regulation and governance remain relative weak points (and are what distinguishes Argentina from higher-ranked global peers), while the backdrop of a highly distorted macroeconomic policy environment has prevented significant private investment, which has hampered research and development and the number of patent applications.
The process for applying for a patent in Argentina has traditionally been a long one, with complex procedures and administrative deficiencies contributing to large backlogs in the Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Industrial (INPI, the national institute of industrial property). However, an agreement signed between the European Patent Office (EPO) and the INPI in February 2018 is likely to facilitate the granting of patents during the forecast period. Similar agreements that already exist between the EPO and Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Brazil have made the application process simpler and quicker, resulting in an increase in successful patent applications. Alongside collaboration with the EPO, Argentina has agreed a "Patent Prosecution Highway" with the US Patent and Trademark Office that similarly aims to expedite the review of patent applications. Argentina is also focusing on other measures, including fast-tracking applications that have already received approval in other countries, taking on more specialist staff at INPI and digitalising internal processes, in an attempt to boost efficiency.
The e-commerce environment is expected to remain strong. Online retail was quicker to develop in Argentina than in many other countries in the region, supported by an early and rapid take-up of mobile broadband. According to the Cámara Argentina de Comercio Electrónico, the e-commerce chamber, purchases via the internet grew by 47% year on year in 2018 (a similar growth rate to 2016), reaching Ps229.8bn. Online and mobile banking is already popular and is used to conduct routine transactions, aided by well-developed mobile banking services and a modern payments system that meets international standards. Logistics is somewhat weaker, with most delivery companies failing to deliver as rapidly as in similarly ranked countries. This reflects a legacy of weak investment in physical infrastructure, which has hampered the quality of the road network and led to some port delays.

Recent events have demonstrated the difficulty of pushing forwards with economic adjustment in a country with a history of hyperinflation and currency crisis. Inflation expectations are unanchored, and sensitivity to exchange-rate movements is extremely high. In this context, and also reflecting growing market concern about the possibility of a Fernández victory in the presidential race, inflation has drifted above 50%, the policy interest rate has moved above 70%, and the peso has been subject to periodic depreciation pressures. Notwithstanding these complications, the government remains committed to the adjustment measures put in place in September 2018 to confront the country's currency crisis, and The Economist Intelligence Unit still assumes that these will guide economic policymaking. Adjustment is centred on a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended to eliminate the primary fiscal deficit this year, and on extremely tight monetary policy. In combination with recent currency devaluation, the latest emergency economic package should in theory be sufficient to reduce concern over the twin deficits. However, it entails pro-cyclical policy tightening that will complicate recovery in 2019 from last year's recession.
Adjustment is taking place under the auspices of an IMF lending deal, which will provide the financial breathing space that the government needs this year and next. A revised stand-by arrangement (SBA) was approved by the Fund in October 2018. It will see Argentina receive US$57bn, allowing the government to close its financing gap in both 2019 and 2020 without having to raise finance in international capital markets. We expect that programme targets will, on the whole, be met, and will engender macroeconomic stability over time. On this assumption, we expect that, later in our forecast period-after the IMF deal expires-external financing conditions for Argentina will improve.
The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and are centred on the strong risk of Mr Macri failing to secure a second term, which would raise questions as to the future direction of economic policy. In our view, a moderate Peronist administration led by Mr Lavagna or Mr Urtubey would be likely to retain the IMF lending arrangement and the broad economic policy stance of the current administration (although some sort of renegotiation of the deal would be likely). A Fernández administration would see sharp adjustments to economic policy and huge volatility in financial markets that would dampen the economic outlook for the foreseeable future.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government expenditure 22.9 23.7 22.8 22.6 22.6 22.6
Government revenue 17.9 20.3 20.8 20.2 20.4 20.4
Budget balance -5.0 -3.4 -2.0 -2.4 -2.2 -2.2
Government debt 85.8 75.5 74.3 71.2 68.8 67.9
The government has had to adjust its expenditure and revenue plans somewhat as it seeks to ease the burden of recession on consumers, but fiscal adjustment is nonetheless ongoing and our forecasts continue to assume a sharp narrowing of the primary deficit this year, and a shift into primary surplus thereafter. The official target for 2019 is primary balance, but the IMF SBA includes provisions for a larger deficit in the event that conditions warrant increased social safety-net spending, and the government has indeed announced such spending measures. On this basis, we forecast a primary fiscal deficit of 0.5% of GDP in 2019. This remains an ambitious target, and in order to accomplish it, the government has introduced measures split fairly evenly between spending cuts and tax increases. In total, the government is planning 1.4% of GDP in spending cuts (centred on capital spending and economic subsidies) and 1.3% of GDP in increased revenue from temporary, across-the-board export taxes in 2019. In our view, these fiscal adjustment measures are sufficient, in theory, to allow the government to meet its targets, and our forecasts assume that the targets will be met. However, notwithstanding increased social safety-net spending, the government will have a tough task ahead of it, particularly in 2019, an election year, and the risk of setbacks will be high.
A major factor in the government's plan for rapid fiscal adjustment is the deterioration of public debt indicators. Peso devaluation in 2018 led to a massive expansion of the public debt burden, and despite strongly contractionary fiscal policy we expect the public debt/GDP ratio to stand at a significant 75.5% this year and to fall only slowly thereafter. Concerns about debt sustainability will serve to dampen investor confidence for an extended period and take several years of austerity to reverse. That said, around half of the public debt is intra-government debt held by the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) and the social security agency.

Deposit rate (av) 32.4 42.1 25.1 16.3 8.0 5.1
Monetary policy will remain extremely tight for the foreseeable future, and we expect the ex ante real reference Leliq interest rate to be high not only this year and next, but also in the remainder of the forecast period as the BCRA seeks to establish policy credibility. Under the money supply targeting system in place since October 2018, the Leliq could also be volatile. Volatility has been evident so far this year, but we think that the general trend in the nominal rate in the rest of the year will be downward (albeit slowly), from the currently extremely high level of over 70%. The key risk to this benign outlook is the vulnerability of the peso to sudden, sharp movements, and this vulnerability (which will, if anything, increase in coming weeks as the election nears) means that the scope for rates to fall will be fairly limited in coming months.

The latest available data are mixed; the data for December-February showed a sustained sequential increase in economic activity, but leading indicators for March suggest that the inflation spike and credit squeeze have damaged sentiment and set back the incipient recovery. With consumer and business confidence still weak, and with extremely tight fiscal and monetary policies raising concerns about growth outside the agricultural sector, we have revised our forecast for GDP for this year, from a contraction of 0.9% to a contraction of 1.1%. But this full-year contraction partly reflects base effects and disguises the fact that, on a seasonally adjusted, quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy will be growing. This forecast rests in turn on a number of key assumptions, an improved harvest (the latest indicators suggest a record crop year), and a positive contribution of net exports to growth, reflecting a combination of import compression and a pick-up in export-related industry in response to much-improved competitiveness. However, there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty attached to our short-term forecasts, and we are likely to see volatility in economic data in the months to come. There is a not insubstantial risk that continued policy tightening could tip Argentina into a deeper, longer recession. Furthermore, Argentina's growth strategy for 2019 is highly export-dependent, which presents further risks, given our forecast for slowing global growth.
Our forecasts for the second part of the forecast period (2020-23) assume a return to moderate growth of around 3% per year. We recognise that such a prompt turnaround represents a benign forecast that is dependent on a successful economic adjustment that finally addresses the problem of the twin deficits and persistently high inflation. We do believe that this adjustment process is achievable; we also believe that the medium-term prospects for energy, mining, export-oriented industry and agriculture are good.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
The agricultural sector will be the key driver of economic resurgence in 2019, as it recovers from severe drought in 2018. Harvests of key crops such as maize and soybean are estimated to have reached recent highs in the 2018/19 (October-September) agricultural campaign. Notwithstanding output volatility, as a result of weather conditions, agriculture will continue to be a key contributor to the Argentinian economy. Although it has accounted for around 10% of GDP over the past decade, and for around 20% of private employment, these figures underestimate its contribution, as they do not include agro-industry. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that the multiplier effects on production and employment of the principal agricultural value chains in Argentina are higher than the average multipliers of the economy. Nonetheless, in the near term, the agricultural sector will face a number of headwinds. Soft commodity prices have been weakening, owing to a combination of strong global supply and ripple effects from an ongoing bilateral trade war between China and the US. In addition, the Macri administration's decision to reinstate generalised export taxes (of Ps4 on every US$1 of revenue) for primary exporters, as a temporary revenue-raising measure, will also weigh on investment in the sector. A soy-specific export tax (of 18%) also currently remains in place. We currently assume that these distortionary taxes will be lifted after 2020 (although the soy-specific tax will be reduced only incrementally), when both economic and political scenarios are on a more solid footing. A more stable, clear and attractive environment for agriculture producers will boost output. It will also support agro-industry (including the processing of Argentina's key crop, soybean) and bolster a manufacturing sector that is currently struggling amid still-weak demand both at home and in Brazil. We expect a mild economic recovery in Brazil in 2019-23, which will also help to produce a moderate pick-up in Argentinian manufacturing in 2019-23.
Better incentives should boost key sectors
Mining and energy are two sectors with great potential. Argentina has vast shale and gas resources, but, to date, commercialising them has proven difficult, particularly in the wake of the nationalisation of the country's largest energy company, YPF, in 2012. The Macri administration made significant progress in tackling some of the main problems constraining investment, including a lack of confidence in the rule of law and extremely restrictive product market regulation. The government has also made strides in rolling back energy subsidies, which kept domestic energy prices artificially low and deterred investment in the sector. Although political and economic constraints have led the government to halt utilities tariff increases temporarily, we assume that these will resume over the forecast period. In 2017 the government announced a series of measures to boost investment and domestic production, thereby reducing reliance on imports. The measures include the "flexibilisation" of labour conditions in Vaca Muerta, a 30,000-sq-km oil field located in southern Argentina that is the world's second-largest shale gas reservoir and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir. The government had also initially sought to subsidise investment in Vaca Muerta by setting above-market prices for unconventional gas between 2018 and 2021. However, it has since been forced to scale back these subsidies considerably in order to meet its strict fiscal targets. This development, along with currently constrictive financing conditions, will deter greater investment in the sector in the near term. However, as macroeconomic conditions improve over the course of the forecast period, we are likely to see exploration and productive activity rise in tandem.
The mining sector also has substantial potential. It shares the mineral-rich southern Andes mountains with Chile, long recognised as one of the world's mining powerhouses. But mining has been slow to develop in Argentina relative to its potential, partly because international companies are put off by a patchwork of different provincial taxes and regulations, some of them restrictive; for example, various provinces ban open-cast mining. In an effort to boost investment in the sector, the federal government persuaded most provinces to agree in June 2017 to harmonise regulations, with provincial mining royalties capped at 3%. Under the deal, there will be a separate 1.5% levy for provincial infrastructure funds. At the signing ceremony Mr Macri said that mining was a "pillar of job creation" capable of creating 125,000 new jobs, and made clear that the government's position that it is possible to develop the industry and employment while protecting the environment. The government's aim is to more than double total mining investment to US$25bn over the next eight years, up from US$10bn in 2007-15.
There are reasons for optimism-not least because of growing interest in Argentina's lithium deposits-Argentina has the third-largest lithium reserves in the world-at a time when global demand for the metal is rising, owing to its use in a new generation of batteries. But both mining companies and environmental groups have approached the new code with some caution, saying that there has been little consultation on it, and noting that it will need legislative approval at both federal and provincial level, a potentially lengthy process.
While noting the benefit of harmonised regulations, mining companies are particularly wary of the tax burden, on the basis that provinces currently charging lower royalties may use the new code as an excuse to raise them up to the 3% ceiling (although government officials have claimed that there will be no changes in royalties on existing mines). Mining companies have also complained that a change in the taxable base from the total "pithead" value (before transport or transformation) to total gross sales would imply an increase in the tax burden. Despite these reservations, we believe that the code is a positive signal for a neglected industry, and, along with rising metals prices, it will help to attract additional investment inflows and boost the sector's growth in the medium term.

Inflation has drifted up above 50% amid unanchored inflation expectations and continued large regulated price adjustments. Right up until the fourth quarter of 2019, inflation is likely to stay above 40%. However, as last year's price spike falls out of the index, and as extremely tight restrictions on money-supply growth curb price pressures, we expect disinflation to take hold, bringing inflation down to around 37% at end-2019. Later in our forecast period, we expect disinflation to continue, assuming that macroeconomic policy remains tight and that domestic supply improves on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers.

The BCRA has been forced to adjust its exchange-rate framework once again, highlighting the difficulty of shifting to a free float in Argentina, where trust in the peso is extremely weak, large domestic transactions have become increasingly dollarised, and a stable peso has become synonymous among the population at large with a strong and stable economy (and vice versa). In this environment, small currency fluctuations have tended to spiral into extreme volatility, and the BCRA has gained Fund approval to jettison its moving "non-intervention band" and intervene directly in the forex market to protect the peso's value. Notwithstanding intervention, we expect the peso to continue to depreciate this year, from around Ps45:US$1 currently to Ps52:US$1 at year-end, amid fairly large swings in the value of the currency related to economic pressures and to pre-election jitters. Thereafter, our forecasts assume some continued nominal depreciation, although the competitiveness gains from the 2018 devaluation will be eroded gradually amid still-high inflation. However, on average, according to our forecasts for the peso and for inflation, the currency will be undervalued in 2019-23 in real trade-weighted terms compared with its ten- or 20-year averages, with positive implications for the external sector.

Last year's currency adjustment will help the current-account deficit to more than halve in 2019, to 2.2% of GDP, on the back of a moderate expansion of goods and services exports and steep import compression amid recession. Assuming that investment in a more competitive industrial sector continues, and that Argentina becomes less dependent on oil imports as energy sector investments start to come on stream, we expect the current account to continue to narrow in the reminder of the forecast period. Reserves coverage will be supported by fresh inflows of funds from the IMF under the SBA. As adjustment in the current account gathers pace, and assuming moderate inflows of foreign direct investment averaging 2.6% of GDP in 2019-23 and an eventual recovery of portfolio flows, a rebuilding of foreign reserves is likely.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Argentina
Stocks and flows
The inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stock was US$73bn (14% of GDP) in 2018 and the outward stock of FDI was US$42bn (8% of GDP). Inflows of FDI to Argentina have been volatile in recent decades and have followed economic cycles of boom and bust. In the 1990s inflows to Argentina increased substantially, reaching 3.7% of GDP in the second half of the decade, reflecting a privatisation programme and acquisitions of domestic private firms. This was followed by a collapse in inward FDI to 1.4% of GDP in 2001-03, reflecting Argentina's default on its foreign debt in 2001 and a subsequent deep recession. Devaluation stimulated a rapid recovery of inward FDI in subsequent years, with inflows averaging 3.7% of GDP in 2003-08. Since then, however, FDI inflows have weakened, from 3% of GDP in 2008 to an annual average 1.8% of GDP in 2009-15. Since Mauricio Macri became president in December 2015, the government has worked to address concerns about the strength and predictability of the legal and regulatory environment. For now, however, inward FDI remains subdued (at 2.3% of GDP in 2018), amid investor concerns over the long-term sustainability of recent improvements to contract rights and rule of law.
Origin and distribution
US firms account for a quarter of the stock of FDI, followed by Spanish firms (16%), and Dutch firms (11%). Chilean, Brazilian and Uruguayan companies account for around 5% each. Spanish firms have invested in privatised utilities, banking and energy. European firms in the utilities and banking sectors were hit hard by the 2001-02 crisis. As many companies disinvested after the crisis, firms from Brazil, Mexico and Chile bought up cheap assets. In 2015 the largest foreign direct investor in Argentina, by some distance, was the US, followed by Spain. The potential for an influx of Chinese FDI, focused in particular in agri-business, is substantial. However, the latest local-source data on FDI inflows into Argentina by country show that, in 2016, only 2% of FDI flows came from China (with the main flows of FDI coming again from the US and the EU, particularly Spain).
Determinants
FDI into Argentina is quite broadly spread; oil accounts for 20% of the stock, followed by chemicals, the automotive sector, metal minerals, the financial sector and telecommunications, although in the past decade almost half of FDI inflows have gone into manufacturing. Historically, Argentina has attracted investors hoping to take advantage of a relatively affluent and protected domestic market. During the 1990s, and as a result of rapid trade liberalisation, domestic market-seeking investment focused on sectors that showed comparative (or even absolute) advantages or were naturally protected from foreign competition (non-tradeable services, such as utilities). Efficiency-seeking investments have been less common, and have been mainly limited to the automotive industry, where government incentives have been in place for over a decade. Recent FDI in services (including information technology-IT) has been attracted by Argentina's skilled workforce and relatively low wages.
Impact
The presence of foreign subsidiaries has brought positive spillovers (both within and across industries) in manufacturing, but only in sectors where domestic firms have proven sufficiently adaptable. In other cases, increased competition from foreign investors, or a preference on the part of the latter for foreign suppliers, has damaged local firms. Telecoms is one example of a sector where the quality of service and technology has been transformed by foreign investment. Foreign investors own most of the privatised utilities. After the 2001-02 maxi-devaluation, which in effect broke the terms of foreign investors' contracts (and after the government declined to renegotiate), investment declined. The contribution of foreign firms to local research and development activities has been limited, as technical progress has been mainly embodied by imported capital goods and turnkey plants. Foreign firms account for a large share of Argentina's exports.
Potential
The major attractions for FDI will be a growing and relatively high-income domestic market, strong natural-resource endowments and, to a lesser extent, Argentina's potential as a manufacturing base. A relatively large pool of skilled human capital and a large stock of natural resources constitute Argentina's long-term advantages. Argentina's exit from default in 2016 will also act as a spur to FDI inflows, by facilitating investor access to investment guarantees and trade finance, which has until recently been lacking

Population growth will remain slow
Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average. Owing to a relatively low birth rate, the percentage of the population aged 14 or under is low by Latin American standards, and is falling. A declining gross birth rate and longer life expectancy also account for the high and rising share of the population aged 65 years and over, although, at close to 12%, this is still below that of OECD countries, where shares above 15% are the norm. Even so, the ageing population places increasing demand on Argentina's healthcare system which, despite its universal coverage, suffers from significant disparities at the provincial level.
The forecast rise in the economically active portion of the population is chiefly the result of an expected increase in the female participation rate. The latter was 49% of the working-age female population in 2018, up from 43% in 1990 but still below a total labour force participation rate of 60% (and below the OECD average female participation rate of 52%), and can be expected to rise in the forecast period. Although the gross birth rate is forecast to fall over the next decade, the gross mortality rate is expected to stay broadly constant as the ageing of the population offsets improvements in healthcare conditions. Argentina has in the past been the recipient of much inward migration (an estimated 85% of the population is of European descent) and has established quite a flexible approach to immigration. Although outward migration from countries such as Venezuela and Haiti in recent years has caused some political tension in other countries in Latin America, such as neighbouring Chile, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Argentina's policy in this area to remain relatively flexible in the forecast period, enabling economic sectors such as agriculture and construction to continue to benefit from immigrant labour. Our positive medium-term economic forecasts for Argentina suggest that inward migration could pick up in the forecast period, following a period of substantial outward migration in recent decades. Partly owing to strong ties to Europe, 600,000 Argentinians are estimated to live abroad. Around one-third of these emigrated in the years immediately following the 2001-02 economic crisis. These newer emigrants are mainly middle-class young people who have moved to Spain, Italy and the US, many of whom benefit from dual Italian or Spanish citizenship.
An urban population with marked regional disparities
The population is highly urbanised. More than 90% of the country's population is concentrated in urban centres-one of the highest ratios in the world. The Buenos Aires metropolitan area contains almost one-third of the national population; when the hinterland of Buenos Aires (the pampas) is included, the proportion rises to two-thirds. Overall, population density is low, at 13 inhabitants per sq km (around one-third of the Latin American average), although this aggregate figure masks wide regional disparities: in the capital there are 13,679 inhabitants per sq km, whereas in the southern provinces of Santa Cruz and Chubut population density is just 0.8 and 1.8 inhabitants per sq km, respectively. Most measures of social and economic development show marked disparities between rural and urban areas, with per-head incomes and healthcare and education indicators much better in the Buenos Aires area than elsewhere.
Argentina's lead in regional healthcare and education standards will erode
Although Argentina's healthcare indicators still compare favourably with those of most of its neighbours, social conditions worsened markedly during the 1998-2002 recession, and in many areas problems have persisted ever since, suggesting that expenditure has become inefficient. Spending on obras sociales, union-run health insurance schemes financed through social security contributions, remains elevated owing to high administrative costs and weak governance mechanisms. The healthcare and education systems are in urgent need of reform. Even so, a high level of educational attainment by regional standards means that the stock of human capital will remain a source of comparative strength, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will close the gap within the region.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, large domestic market (with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region), and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors. However, an ongoing economic adjustment to address macroeconomic imbalances and rein in inflation will deter investment in the very short term, especially as businesses await greater political and economic certainty. On the assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in the presidential election in October, and that orthodox economic policy is given continuity, The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a shift to moderate GDP growth rates of an annual average 2.9% in 2020-23. Improvements to the business environment throughout the forecast period should create additional domestic market opportunities in the medium term.
Some improvement in purchasing power expected
Argentina is a middle-income country with one of the highest levels of GDP per head in the region-US$21,720 at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates in 2018. Demographics are generally supportive of growth: the population is estimated at around 45m (the fourth-largest in Latin America), and is reasonably young, albeit not as young as that of most other countries in the region. Moreover, urbanisation is high, at more than 90% of the population. However, as in much of the region, income inequality and poverty remain high. According to recently released data from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos de la República Argentina (INDEC, the national statistics institute), the poverty rate came in at 32% in the second half of 2018. The extreme poverty rate was 6.7%. These numbers illustrate the detrimental impact of last year's recession on Argentinians' living conditions. However, there is significant variation in the incidence of poverty by region, with the highest poverty rates recorded in the Northern provinces of Corrientes (49.3%) and Chaco (41.4%). By contrast, the poverty rate was much lower in cities in the Patagonian (24.9%) and the Greater Buenos Aires (31.3%) provinces. In fact, in the capital, Buenos Aires, the poverty rate was only 12.6%.
A full analysis of the poverty data over time is complicated by a lack of historical data. A deterioration of statistical quality during the previous administration led to unreliable poverty statistics; in the latter years of the previous administration, INDEC stopped publishing poverty statistics altogether. Under new leadership, INDEC began publishing poverty data in mid-2016, using new methodology that is not comparable with the discredited historical data. However, the mid-2016 INDEC data are similar to figures published by the Centro de Estudios Distributivos Laborales y Sociales (Cedlas), a social policy research institute at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. According to Cedlas, the poverty rate is roughly similar to data from the first half of 2011, implying that there was no progress on poverty reduction between 2011 and 2016. In the medium term, lower inflation rates and steady economic growth should help to reduce poverty through spillover effects. In the meantime, however, poor social conditions will contribute to insecurity and social unrest.

A long-term shift in consumer attitudes towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets was brought about by the economic crisis of 2001-02. However, we expect the proportion of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco to fall gradually in the forecast period, and for the proportion of consumer spending on hotels and restaurants, healthcare, leisure and education to grow. This assumes growth in purchasing power as real disposable incomes rise over the course of the forecast period, driven by growth in employment, income redistribution via Argentina's relatively new conditional cash transfer schemes, and greater efforts at financial inclusion, which suggest a steady increase in access to bank credit during the forecast period. One difference between Argentina and the rest of the region will be the age of the population. Argentina's population will remain markedly older; just over 11% were aged 65 years and over in 2018. This will affect consumption patterns, notably pushing up overall expenditure on healthcare.

Abundant natural resources and a skilled labour force underpin potential
Argentina has historically been susceptible to cycles of boom and bust, reflecting both a vulnerability to external conditions and domestic policy challenges. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecast rests on the assumption that Argentina will adopt a more sustainable economic model that reduces fiscal and external imbalances, allowing the economy to grow by an average of 2.5% in 2019-50.
Initial conditions: Argentina's GDP per head of US$11,599 in 2018 (US$21,720 at purchasing power parity) is one of the highest in the region. However, as it is still only one-third of the US figure, there is clearly potential for Argentina to catch up to developed-country levels. The internal market is relatively large and, although the territory is extensive, there are few internal geographical obstacles, although Argentina is distant from developed-country markets and high transport costs will place an extra burden on exporters. For a decade after the 2001 maxi-devaluation, labour was cheaper than during the 1990s, but the gains from devaluation had been eliminated by 2012 amid high inflation and sustained real wage growth. Despite two decades of gradual de-industrialisation, Argentina retains a solid skilled labour base, and the capacity to carry out high-level research and development. It will attract manufacturing investment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind Asian rivals. Argentina has a strong comparative advantage in agriculture, although, as a commodity producer, it will face more volatile terms of trade than Asian competitors. This means that growth is likely to be uneven.
Demographic trends: Argentina shares demographic as well as cultural features with Europe. The average age of the population is higher than in most of the rest of the region and population growth both in percentage and absolute terms is expected to be slightly lower. We expect population growth of 0.7% per year in 2017-50, less than half the average recorded in 1980-2000. At present, the working-age population is still growing faster than the overall population, but we expect this trend to change from around 2030. Although the share of the working age population will continue to rise gradually towards OECD levels, from an estimated 64% in 2020, growth in the labour force will be modest. Particularly towards the end of the long-term forecast period, the contribution of labour to GDP will therefore be weaker.
The population is more urbanised and better provided with healthcare than in other Latin American countries, leading to a life expectancy of around 77 years, similar to that of many developed countries. Given the existence of the welfare state and the severe weakening of the finances of the state and private pensions systems in the past two decades, the growing elderly population will increasingly generate strains on the public finances.
External conditions: Growth-determining factors exogenous to Argentina will include the level of developed-country interest rates (in the past this has been strongly correlated with the volume of capital flows into Latin America and has had a major impact on growth) and commodity prices. Argentina will remain highly dependent on income from exports of agricultural commodities to provide an investible surplus for deployment elsewhere in the economy. Restricted access to finance since the 2001 default has raised the cost of capital in the past decade by forcing reliance on financing from the shallow, more expensive domestic market. However, Argentina's exit from default in April 2016 implies improved access to international capital markets to facilitate stronger growth in investment, particularly in agriculture, energy and infrastructure.
Institutional weaknesses will constrain growth
Institutions and policy trends: Disappointing economic outcomes have been the indirect result of shortcomings in policymaking and institutions. Argentina scores moderately to poorly on measures of corruption, security and the rule of law. Our analysis suggests that an improvement in the overall institutional climate would have a significant impact on long-term growth, but institutional reforms will take a long time to bear fruit. The quality of policymaking is likely to improve more rapidly. The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15) clashed with foreign investors over the terms of contracts, and oversaw a phase of ad hoc intervention in the economy. A more market-friendly administration, led by Mauricio Macri, is seeking to address these problems, and under our assumption that the president will win a second term at October elections, we expect that the government will succeed early on in the long-term forecast period in establishing a new framework for foreign investors in sectors such as utilities.
Long-term performance: We forecast that average annual GDP will grow by 2.5% in 2019-50, with the growth rate peaking at 3% in 2021-30, before slowing to 2.2% by 2041-50. Our forecasts assume that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm in the first part of the 2018-50 forecast period, before tapering off somewhat over the latter part of the period. We also assume that as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign investment. Firms will increasingly look beyond national borders in order to achieve economies of scale, and this will stimulate efficiency gains. Having said this, and although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels. This is particularly the case in the light of low levels of domestic investment in research and development, and we expect limited progress in catching up with developed country incomes, even in the long-term forecast period.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Climate change represents a risk to Argentina's long-term growth rate, most obviously through its impact on the important agriculture sector. Argentina has suffered four major droughts in the period since 2009 alone, which has produced a severe knock-on impact on real GDP each time. Since it came to office in late 2015, the Macri administration has worked to develop a comprehensive climate change plan; one element of this is the increased use of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind and solar power. Despite having some of Latin America's most abundant natural energy resources, less than 2% of the country's electricity currently comes from renewable energy. Under the "RenovAr" programme, Argentina is now targeting a total of 20% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. As part of its climate change mitigation efforts Argentina is aiming to surpass its nationally determined contribution (NDC) originally submitted under the Paris Agreement.
The Macri administration is also in the process of developing sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans for agriculture, transport, infrastructure, forests, industry and energy, with a view to unveiling a new national climate change plan in 2019. The central government is also working on the development of a climate change map, to work with local and provincial authorities to determine geographical vulnerabilities and develop adaptation and mitigation plans, and financing, accordingly. In the Uruguay River area on the border between Argentina and Uruguay, a joint initiative between the two countries is in progress to try to increase the resilience of vulnerable coastal populations in this area. Continued progress in all these areas, both in the planning and implementation stages, will be necessary to reduce the long-term impact on growth as a result of climate change.
Technological developments
Argentina's high skills base by regional comparison will be a key factor supporting the country's ability to adapt to technological disruption in the long term. Combined with high per-head incomes, this helps to explain the country's leading position in Latin America with regard to mobile and broadband penetration, e-commerce and m-commerce, and the strength of sectors such as software development and financial technology (fintech). The capital city, Buenos Aires, is a hub for both these industries in Latin America. It is the largest exporter of software in the region, and is a large and rapidly growing centre for fintech centred on payment systems, corporate financial management, consumer and business lending, and new technologies for existing financial institutions
The e-commerce environment is expected to remain strong, and m-commerce will grow, supported by high penetration of mobile broadband. Online retail has been quicker to develop than in many other countries in the region, and is still growing rapidly (by 47% in 2018). Online and mobile banking is already popular, and is used by customers to conduct routine transactions, aided by well-developed mobile banking services and a modern payments system that meets international standards.
Regulation and governance remain relative weak points, while a backdrop of still-high inflation and macroeconomic distortions will in the short term continue to deter significant private (including foreign investment), to the detriment of research and development, and the number of patent applications. Recent reforms to simplify patent applications should, however, produce improvements going forward.
A continuing weakness that shows fewer sign of progress as yet is logistics, with most delivery companies failing to deliver as rapidly as is the case in similarly ranked countries. This reflects a legacy of weak investment in physical infrastructure, which has hampered the quality of the road network and led to some port delays. We assume better progress in this area in the long term, which will be necessary to insert Argentina into global value chains, and allow for "leapfrogging" to tilt industrial production more rapidly towards high-tech, high-value-added products
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Nigeria--highlights: Political outlook
The government will largely fail to achieve its promises of tackling corruption, improving stability and boosting living standards. A period of lower oil revenue in 2019 and 2020, after a largely squandered decade of higher prices, will hinder the government's ability to boost development, particularly of infrastructure. Non-oil tax rises are unavoidable over the long term, but the revenue/GDP ratio will remain among the world's lowest, limiting the effectiveness of fiscal policy. High levels of poverty and unemployment will combine with the country's ethnic and religious divisions to ignite into outbreaks of violence. Nonetheless, Nigeria has a high tolerance for political instability, and much of it is localised. There is little significant threat to the government's position outside of the election cycle.

The business environment in Nigeria is unlikely to improve significantly. Even if progress is made, it will often be at a slower rate than in the country's peers. Systemic problems in infrastructure and the labour market mean that Nigeria remains towards the bottom of the global business environment rankings for the forecast period, at 77th out of 82 countries in 2019-23. On a regional basis, Nigeria is ranked 15th out of 17 countries for the forecast period. Efforts to create a more attractive business environment are likely to produce only modest results, owing to parliamentary divisions (which reflect societal divisions more widely), the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions and the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes. It will remain largely beyond the capacity of Nigeria's policymakers, even in the medium term, to push through much-needed and comprehensive reforms, especially when they challenge the status quo.
Nigeria--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP at factor cost growth (%) 1.9 2.2 2.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 12.1 12.7 11.4 9.2 9.1 8.8

Although economic growth in 2019-23 will continue to recover from the recession of 2016-17, the pace will remain well below historic averages. Trends in the oil sector and elections in 2019 will have a negative effect on the economy. Inflation will remain in double digits, amid currency depreciation and politicised monetary policy. Economic policymakers will struggle to resist calls from the legislature to increase spending, given pressing development needs. Set against this, oil sector revenue is likely to underperform, leading to continual fiscal deficits of about 2% of GDP. The current account will post small surpluses after several decades of large surpluses amid weaker revenue from oil exports.
Nigeria--highlights: Demographic outlook

Population growth   2.7 2.6
Working-age population growth   3.0 3.0
Labour force growth   2.8 3.5
The population growth rate will remain high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile. However, the formal economy will not grow quickly enough to provide the employment needed to absorb 3% annual growth in the working-age population. This will jeopardise attempts to reduce poverty. Furthermore, high numbers of poor young unemployed people will provide a fertile recruiting ground for militant groups, thus prolonging violent instability in large parts of the country.
Nigeria--highlights: Market opportunities

Household consumption per head (US$) 1,780 1,920 2,010 2,190 2,420 2,650
Nigeria remains an important market for many multinationals because of its abundant natural resources and the size of its population (the largest in Africa), despite the very low level of income on average. Indeed, in absolute, let alone relative terms, Nigeria has more people in extreme poverty than any other country in Africa. However, the relatively large wealthy elite and growing middle class make up important submarkets. Nigeria has the potential to be a profitable market for multinational companies that know how to operate in its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and can overcome the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure. Strong growth in consumption towards the end of the forecast period will increase this attractiveness.
Nigeria--highlights: Long-term outlook

Growth of real GDP per head 0.4 1.0 0.7
Growth of real GDP 2.9 3.2 3.1
Labour productivity growth -0.1 0.5 0.3
Nigeria's long-term economic performance will pick up moderately, driven by a stronger export sector as large projects come on stream. However, reforms to improve the business environment and unlock investor confidence are unlikely to be sufficient to promote fundamental diversification of the economy, meaning that Nigeria will remain heavily exposed to the oil and gas sector. Moreover, income levels will remain very low.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Muhammadu Buhari-a former military dictator turned civilian politician-first became president in 2015 and won a second four-year term in office in February 2019. Mr Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) also retained a majority in both houses, which it had achieved in 2015. The ascension to power of Mr Buhari and the APC in 2015 ended the domination of politics by the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which had lasted since the start of civilian rule in 1999. The cabinet must contain representatives from each of Nigeria's 36 states, although very few are elected politicians. Mr Buhari and his ministers are scrutinised by an elected bicameral National Assembly. State governments enjoy considerable autonomy under governors and elected state assemblies.

The cracks in the APC are expected to widen
The APC is far from a united entity, however. It is an amalgamation of the three largest former opposition parties and a faction of a fourth (all with separate geographic and ethnic power bases, as well as varying ideologies), together with PDP defectors. Political appointments have therefore been based in numerous instances on distributing the vestiges of power among the APC's constituent elements rather than merit. In late 2018 there were mass defections from the APC, with many crossing the floor to join the PDP. Although in a sense this refreshed the party ahead of Mr Buhari's second term, dissension within the ranks is likely to re-emerge as the administration struggles to turn around Nigeria's struggling economy and the next election approaches, in 2023.
Political outlook: Political stability
Mr Buhari won a presidential election in February 2019 and will remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. For any Nigerian leader, managing the country's myriad security threats would be an insoluble challenge, but under Mr Buhari there are particular reasons to expect serious, albeit localised unrest.
The election revealed a deep sense of voter apathy in southern Nigeria-an economically vital region, although prone to militancy and separatism, and where voter turnout was less than 20% in some places. In his first term Mr Buhari was seen by many in the southern region as absent, rarely making visits there, and with the ruling APC vote share being heavily concentrated in the north-and with that region facing various and urgent security issues-government attention will probably remain focused there. As a result, the disconnect between Nigeria's south and mainstream politics is unlikely to heal. Indeed, the government will give priority to containing banditry in the very far north-west and the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which is resurgent in the north-east and is utilising new tactics and more sophisticated hardware. Mr Buhari's "zero tolerance" approach to terrorism was a major reason for the strong turnout and support for him in the affected states. As was the case in his last tenure, substantial federal resources are likely to be channelled towards restoring law and order in the region. However, militants in the oil-producing south cite the use of oil earnings for far-flung causes such as combating Boko Haram-rather than for local development-as justification for the insurgency. So it seems likely that attacks by aggrieved militants on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state.
Boko Haram will probably be aggressively countered, but in the process the north-east of Nigeria will essentially become a low-level conflict zone. Just to the south of this region, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, a more insoluble challenge will be addressing extremely violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for increasingly scarce water and land resources. Formal land titling is a potential answer, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Moreover, in Mr Buhari's first term, it was clear that military engagements in other parts of Nigeria have priority when it comes to deploying the army's thinly spread resources, and the same is likely to be true in his second. Again, the direct security impact of the conflict will be localised, with little spillover into the administrative capital, Abuja, or the economic capital, Lagos. The entire country will feel the secondary effects, however, in the form of constricted food supply and high consumer prices.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Institutional effectiveness will remain poor in Nigeria. The National Assembly is very slow at moving through new legislation, owing both to inefficiency and to tensions between the executive and legislative branches of government. With the APC largely a coalition of convenience, competing ideologies and priorities will continue to hinder the legislative process, as will tensions over spending priorities between the federal government and powerful state governors. Furthermore, vested political interests, inefficiency and corruption have slowed reform in Nigeria for decades, and these issues are unlikely to change in the forecast period.
Corruption will prove impossible to tackle comprehensively
Nigeria has traditionally had a relatively strong economic team, led by able technocrats generally in favour of structural reform. In his first term Mr Buhari maintained this practice, given the need to bolster confidence among international investors and lenders, and he will probably continue in this vein in his second term. However, as always, the team's capacity to translate good intentions into action will be hampered by Nigeria's complex political environment, entrenched rent-seeking interest groups and weak administrative system. Despite some reforms of the civil service-including the removal of so-called ghost workers by the new administration-the public sector will remain overstaffed, highly bureaucratic and largely ineffective, given internal resistance to reform and a lack of desire among the leadership to upset deep-seated patronage networks and finely balanced factions within the APC. Although some progress has been made in strengthening institutional capacity to check more blatant forms of corruption, rent-seeking officials and politicians have found more subtle ways to defraud the Treasury, with continued corrosive effects on politics and economic management. Perceptions of corruption willremain high and extend across state institutions. Accusations from some businesses about "round tripping", whereby individuals and companies access foreign exchange at the overvalued official rate and then sell it on the parallel market for a profit, will also abound.
A weak judiciary will undermine the fight against corruption
Fighting corruption has long been a government priority, and is a key objective for Mr Buhari, but the administration's efforts are likely to yield limited results. Structural deficiencies-in particular inadequate checks and balances-mean that graft will remain a problem despite the periodic headline-grabbing arrests. In addition, allegations of political score-settling are often levelled at the authorities in their anti-corruption efforts-something that will stoke acrimony and prevent greater co-operation across the political, legal and social spheres. The judicial system is still deeply undermined by corruption and hugely underfunded. This has resulted in poor administration of justice, including long delays in the hearing of cases.
Political outlook: Election watch
Nigeria's national elections took place on February 23rd and were marred by violence, delays and voter apathy, but Mr Buhari of the ruling APC secured 56% of the vote. Participation across the country, at 35%, was well down on the 44% turnout rate in 2015, partly reflecting a delay to the poll but also disengagement with the two main candidates. There was especially low participation in the south-a traditional PDP stronghold-with voters there evidently feeling alienated by the two main candidates (who are both northern). The parliamentary election gave the APC a large majority in both houses; in theory, this should allow for the swift passage of legislation, but Mr Buhari's first term was marked by divisions between the executive and parliament (as had happened to presidents before him), and crucial bills including the national budget were delayed by months. As legislators typically prioritise the interests of their constituents over party and federation in Nigeria, similar tensions could easily reoccur in Mr Buhari's second stint. The next election will be in 2023, and a new APC presidential candidate will stand. Custom dictates that after two terms for a northerner, the next APC and PDP nominees will be from the country's south.
Political outlook: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian import restrictions) could strain ties. Relations with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.

Nigeria's business environment will remain among the most challenging in the world over the next five years. Small improvements in the political environment and minor pro-business policy measures will not be enough to prevent the country dropping by two places in the global rankings, to 77th (out of 82 countries) as others improve at a faster rate. Similarly, in the regional rankings Nigeria slips by one place, from 13th to 14th (out of 17 countries).
Efforts to create a significantly more attractive business environment in the country will continue to be hindered by the slow pace of market-oriented structural reforms, the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions, the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes and extremely poor infrastructure. It will remain largely beyond the capacity of Nigeria's policymakers, even in the medium term, to push through the much-needed and comprehensive reforms.
Efforts to diversify economy away from oil will require pro-business reforms
Although Nigeria will continue to recover from the economic recession of 2016 during the forecast period, prices for its export and fiscal mainstay, oil, will remain well below the peaks seen in the early 2010s. This will place ongoing strain on the economy. However, there is good to come from this, as it will force the administration to do more to improve the business environment and facilitate growth in the non-oil sector. Furthermore, with the government unable to afford a sustained large-scale public spending spree to try to boost growth (the revenue/GDP ratio is too low), it will instead edge towards sanctioning a greater role for private companies in the provision of public services. This includes the domains of healthcare, education and infrastructure building, although the benefits of this will only be felt after the end of the forecast period.

Business environment outlook: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but as oil prices decline, the naira weakens anyway as foreign-exchange inflows lessen.
2021-23: A premium between the official and parallel market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will markedly increase the fiscal cost of the civil service.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically following the completion of the 2019 elections, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts national savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff, although unemployment remains high and the market generally loose.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

The economy will perform less badly than in 2016, but not by much
Nigeria will maintain positive economic growth during the forecast period. However, although marking an improvement on the contraction recorded in 2016, that remains a long way from saying that the country has a strong economy. Real GDP per head growth remains too low to significantly reduce poverty rates in the country. Indeed, Nigeria's ranking for this category actually deteriorates in 2019-23. Nigeria's macroeconomic environment will remain constrained by insecure property rights, a weak civil service, confusion caused by overlaps and contradictions between local, state and federal government actions, and deeply entrenched vested interests opposed to free-market competition. Macroeconomic policy will continue to espouse the promotion of market-led growth and poverty reduction, but action is unlikely to match rhetoric.

During his time as military leader in the 1980s, the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, demonstrated a penchant for heavy state intervention at the expense of private-sector endeavour, and his policy statements while in power since 2015 imply that he still sees a large regulatory role for the state. However, he has pro-business reformers with private-sector experience in his inner circle, although there are others opposed to such reforms, and the state's limited capacity (in terms of both skills and finances) to expand its role will act as a constraint on its interference. The net result is likely to bring modest policy improvements, but not quickly enough to affect Nigeria's global ranking.
Despite the rhetoric of the government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which was released in early 2017, it is highly unlikely that Nigeria will embark on major market-oriented structural reforms during the forecast period. The ERGP offers a vision of an economy that is largely private-sector-driven, recognising the power of free markets. However, vested interests will hinder such an agenda, including politicians wanting to protect patronage networks across geopolitical faultlines, consumers used to price controls and large subsidies, and, in particular, powerful business interests.
Given the small number of politically connected companies operating in many formal sectors, and the existing barriers to entry into many sectors, competition is expected to remain limited. Companies in the formal sector have been dependent on state subsidies and have been shielded by protectionist policies for so long that many are unlikely to respond favourably to government implementation of fundamental free-market reforms. The Buhari administration will find extra-governmental support for continued state intervention, both openly and discreetly, particularly with regard to foreign trade.

An opaque and slow-moving policy environment has historically limited-but not entirely deterred-foreign investors in Nigeria. Although governments are keen to access global capital as a means of propelling economic development, there is also a nativist sentiment; local companies with political links are often given favourable treatment. Little change is expected in the government's policy towards foreign investment over the forecast period, due to deeply entrenched vested interests. With other countries showing improvement, Nigeria's position will remain unchanged in both the global and regional rankings.
Various factors will limit investor interest
A lower oil price environment compared with earlier boom years will limit investor interest in that sector. Despite government efforts to drum up higher levels of non-oil investment, this will be limited by the complexities of the local business environment, along with the bureaucracy, corruption, low productivity, poor infrastructure, cash-call arrears by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to joint-venture partners and generally low income levels that restrict the potential market. Ongoing foreign-exchange restrictions will remain an off-putting factor for investors.
In addition to the weaker oil price environment, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the hydrocarbons sector will also remain constrained until the regulatory and tax environments get finalised. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) was designed to do this; it was first submitted to the National Assembly (parliament) in 2008, and after several years of delay the complex piece of legislature was broken down into four separate bills to make passage easier. Nonetheless, progress remains slow, largely because of the rival claims of the stakeholders, both local and foreign, who continue to lobby to advance their interests, which invariably relate to the control and sharing of the benefits derived from Nigeria's considerable oil and gas endowment. Although there is general agreement among all parties that the country's petroleum sector has long been in need of structural and regulatory reform to enable it to operate more efficiently, there is lack of consensus on how to achieve this, both internally, such as between federalists and resource nationalists in the oil-producing areas and between the government and the multinationals responsible for most of the country's hydrocarbon output. A less controversial part of the PIB was passed in 2018, but the president returned the bill to parliament unsigned, possibly because the bill would reduce the power of the oil minister to award, amend, renew, extend or revoke oil licences and contracts. Accordingly, we expect further progress in improving the regulatory environment to be limited during the forecast period.
Most disconcerting for investors is the lack of progress in establishing a new oil and gas fiscal regime. With the government having often declared its intention to change the fiscal regime to increase its take of oil profits, oil companies cannot be sure whether any new arrangement-when finally enacted-will match their profit expectations. Nigerian oil officials and civil society groups have for many years complained that the existing regime is outdated and under-rewards their country for its oil production, especially the deepwater terms that were negotiated in the early 1990s when oil prices were only US$20/barrel. For example, Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a government-funded watchdog, said in a study in March 2019 that Nigeria had lost at least US$16bn over a ten-year period (between 2008 and 2017), owing to the non-review of the production sharing contracts signed with oil companies in 1993.
The proposed petroleum industry fiscal bill introduces a price-based assessment for royalties, with rates scaled according to daily production. It also includes a provision for an additional petroleum income tax when the price of crude exceeds US$60/b. The additional tax rate is 0.5% for every additional US$1 price increase to a maximum additional tax rate of 60%. Executives of major international oil companies have argued that increases in oil taxes in the proposed petroleum industry legation are too high and liable to deter investment in exploration. Concern has also been expressed over the complexity of the proposed changes. In May 2018 the NNPC advocated for the simplification of the fiscal system in the PIFB to ease implementation and ensure progressivity. Overall, the process is still in an early conceptual stage, and the authorities will continue to face conflicting demands from various stakeholders as the legislative process moves forward, slowing progress. These include ethnic nationalists demanding a greater share of oil revenue for impoverished communities in oil-producing areas (so-called host communities); federal officials wanting to maximise Nigeria's share of oil profits; and multinational oil companies seeking to hold on to their profits, while also demanding improvement in the local operating environment. Given all of this, it is difficult to envisage any rapid improvement in the investment environment in the hydrocarbons sector.
The administration plans to sell some oil and non-oil state assets in the coming years to raise money to help to cover the budget deficit. However, despite including substantial amounts of privatisation proceeds in its revenue projections in the 2018 and 2019 budgets, the administration has been slow to quicken the pace of its slow-moving privatisation programme. The authorities will be cautious in selling state enterprises, given the likely opposition from local interest groups that have benefited from the status quo or believe that the state should retain its control of strategic public utilities. The government's ability to sell loss-making state enterprises that rely on some form of state subvention to survive will depend on its willingness to allow these concerns to adopt free marketing pricing for their goods and services. For example, the NNPC will find it difficult to find suitable buyers for its underperforming oil refineries while official domestic petrol prices remain below cost recovery.
The government announced in March 2019 that it intends to reduce the NNPC's stake in joint venture oil companies (JVCs) to 40% in order to bolster the public finances. Through the parastatal the government currently holds a 55% stake in the JVC operated by Shell (UK/Netherlands) and 60% equity in the other ventures operated by other multinationals. Doing so would give foreign partners a freer hand to develop new projects, but existing investors will be wary of enlarging their stake in Nigeria's upstream sector before the enactment of the new petroleum industry laws, especially with respect to the fiscal regime (where the prospective regulatory environment remains highly uncertain). This will be reflected in price, and parliament will be unsupportive of selling off key assets, should it be low. Overall, the equity restructure is unlikely to take place soon, and in any case the government, as advised by the IMF, would want to amend the Petroleum Profit Tax Act first to ensure that sales of oil assets do not generate new tax exemptions that result in a revenue loss for the state.
Public mistrust of foreign investment will remain high
Given the government's desire to attract foreign capital, outright expropriation of foreign-owned assets is unlikely. However, legal disputes and accusations of corruption can easily ensnare investors. A running dispute between MTN, a major South African-owned telecommunications company, and the Nigerian government over large financial demands made on the firm for alleged infringements illustrates the risks faced by foreign companies that fall foul of the country's regulators. In October 2015 the Nigerian Communications Commission fined MTN a record US$5.2bn for failing to disconnect unregistered SIM cards. After negotiations, the company paid a reduced fine of just over US$1bn. In August 2018 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directed MTN to return US$8.1bn that it alleged was illegally repatriated out of Nigeria. Shortly after this, the government demanded that the company pay US$2bn owed in back-dated taxes. MTN has disputed both claims.

Nigeria will remain one of the worst-ranked countries for foreign trade and exchange controls during the forecast period. We expect the administration to continue to struggle with the management of the foreign-exchange system in an economy prone to fluctuations in supplies of hard currencies, largely owing to reliance on volatile crude oil sales. The Buhari administration has inched towards relaxing the foreign exchange regime with the creation in April 2017 of a special foreign-exchange window for investors and exporter (I&E window) for trading currencies at more market-determined rates, although the CBN still targets particular rates with interventions. This arrangement falls well short of full currency flexibility, and the government continues to retain an over-valued official exchange rate and implement import restrictions aimed at curtailing domestic demand for foreign exchange. The result has been a multiple exchange-rate environment that further complicates the already challenging business conditions. Whenever oil prices decline, investor concern about omnipresent risk of capital controls being reintroduced (as they temporarily were in 2016) will be heightened, which can reduce long-term financial flows in particular. While we expect some devaluation of the naira to be allowed over the forecast period, ongoing attempts to manage the currency's value will prevent the official naira rate from reaching market-clearing levels, and a large premium with the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Fixing, used by the I&E window, and parallel market rates will persist.
Protectionist sentiment will persist
Protectionist sentiment will remain strong in Nigeria, and it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will have either the political will or the ideological inclination to promote free trade. The government maintains high import tariffs and import bans on several dozen goods, including many foodstuffs, with the view of promoting local production and development of the non-oil sector. In March 2019 the CBN added textiles to a list of categories of goods and services for which importers are barred from accessing regulated foreign-exchange markets. The financial regulator indicated in January 2019 that the foreign-exchange restrictions may be increased from 43 items to 50 items. Because of these restrictions, cross-border smuggling is likely to remain an important feature of the Nigerian economy and exert additional pressure on locally based businesses.
The capacity and efficiency of Nigerian ports have improved following the implementation of an ambitious concession programme in the mid-2000s that transferred management of terminals to private operators. However, although the reforms have improved port operations and ship turnaround times, there remains the problem of corruption in the customs service, which can complicate and delay the clearance of goods, adding to the cost of doing business. Furthermore, port operations are still hampered by inadequate infrastructure, including the poor condition of the roads leading to the main seaports in the commercial capital, Lagos.

The government will attempt to increase tax rates and broaden the coverage of collection during the forecast period. It is likely to use a carrot-and-stick approach; although there will be increases in tax rates for corporates and consumers, some of the initial burden will be offset by offers of amnesties and moves to make it easier to pay taxes. The net result is little change in the score for this category, with Nigeria's ranking falling as other countries improve.
Widening the tax net is a priority
With the total tax-to-GDP ratio at only 6% across all tiers of government, Nigeria has one of the lowest tax takes in the world. The Federal Inland Service (FIRS) has made some progress in its various campaigns to widen the tax base, increasing the national tax roll to 19m people by December 2018, from 14m in 2014. The administration is considering raising value-added tax (VAT) from the current rate of 5% to 7.5% but this is unlikely to happen before 2020, as it requires an amendment of the Value Added Tax Act and will be deeply unpopular at a time when the economy is underperforming and living standards are declining. The extent of the increase is likely to be restrained by concerns about the effect on consumer price inflation, which is already high. The tax authorities will seek new ways to boost tax compliance and reduce tax exemptions, but it is doubtful whether their efforts will be sufficient to make a significant improvement to government finances from such a low base.
Many companies would be able to absorb moderate tax rises as long as they were accompanied by major improvements in the whole tax payment system. Companies in the formal sector complain about being subjected to multiple taxes as a result of tax authorities at the different tiers of government imposing a variety of levies, sometimes illegally. The fiscal rivalry between federal and subnational administrations makes it difficult for the central government to establish any new tax body with significant autonomy and the power to impose tax harmonisation. The efficacy of tax administration varies considerably by state. It is most sophisticated in the commercial capital, Lagos.

Nigeria's banking sector will continue to face a number of severe challenges, with the country's ranking for this category deteriorating in the forecast period as a result. The recession of 2016 (and prospects for only a weak recovery in the coming years) and deep exposure to the depressed oil and power sectors will continue to challenge banks' financial soundness. Non-performing loans surpassed 15% of total loans during 2017 and although it has been coming down (to 11.7% at end-2018), the NPL ratio is likely to remain high in the coming years as the oil sector continues to underperform and the wider economy posts weak growth, hindering businesses' operations. A weakening exchange rate adds to this gloomy picture. Lending denominated in US dollars accounts for almost half of banks' loan books, and lending to the oil and gas sector makes up about one-third of gross loans.
Some improvements to the financial sector are in prospect, but not many
Although the restructuring of the banking sector that took place after a major financial crisis in 2009 means that Nigerian banks are better placed to develop the domestic financial sector further, large challenges remain in raising standards to international levels, and crossborder supervision needs to be improved. Bank lending to private businesses-especially small and medium-sized firms-has been subdued in a high interest-rate environment, combined with low demand due to broader economic weaknesses. Nevertheless, as the forecast period progresses, greater competition in the banking sector should drive down the cost of banking and improve the availability of lending in the longer term, especially for corporate clients. Moreover, the government's efforts to create a long-term government bond market, as seen in its plan announced in April 2019 to issue 30-year federal government bonds, will help with the pricing of corporate debt and may allow the development of a more active corporate bond market in the future. Coupled with new listings and greater liquidity on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, this should make it easier to raise funds as the forecast period progresses.

The government of Mr Buhari has made reducing unemployment and boosting job creation one of its top priorities, particularly with regard to young people. However, the risk is that, rather than attempting to make liberalising changes to the economy as a means to improve job creation, the administration will instead adopt a more nationalistic approach, attempting to boost local employment by restricting that of foreigners. This prospect has led to the ranking for this category deteriorating in the forecast period.
Poor education system will continue to generate skills deficiency
The dire state of the education system, notably the vocational system and apprenticeship schemes, means that skilled manual labour-from bricklayers to mechanics and electricians-will remain in short supply. Additionally, poor standards of education, healthcare and transport mean that, in terms of unskilled labour, productivity levels are very low. Nigeria's university system will continue to churn out large numbers of graduates, with a bias towards the arts and social sciences, but the economy will still suffer from a large deficit of skilled personnel, particularly in the fields of science and technology, as well as business management. Foreign skilled personnel will also remain scarce. The government's reform drive to enhance the business environment has made obtaining entry visas easier for foreigners, but the process of securing work permits for expatriates will continue to be complex and costly, ultimately stemming the inflow of skilled foreign labour.
More and more Nigerians are no longer reconciled to a life earning poverty-level wages; they aspire to modern standards of living, but there are not enough of the jobs that would bring them to this level. The dilemma facing the authorities is that the supply of workers seeking good jobs is likely to continue to outstrip demand from employers. This imbalance has both economic and political consequences in a nation that is susceptible to sectarian conflicts, often fuelled by competition for scarce resources. High unemployment and underemployment are set to remain worrying features of the Nigerian economy, particularly among the young, and could well become a source of greater social and political instability.
Unions often stand in the way of reform
Although labour law reform in 2005 weakened the capacity of the unions to organise political or sympathy strikes, the labour movement remains powerful, capable of organising paralysing national strikes. Partly as a result of union pressure, the government has been forced to increase the minimum wage significantly in recent years, with the latest rise enacted in early 2019. Although such increases have been required to offset the rising cost of living over the past decade, and should not affect the more skilled jobs in much of the private sector, where pay is already above this level, it is a move likely to diminish any prospects of rapid growth in the formal economy for lower-skilled and labour-intensive sectors such as manufacturing. Furthermore, given deficiencies in infrastructure, as well as healthcare and education provision, productivity in Nigeria will remain a long way below that in other developing countries.

Nigeria's dire infrastructure is a major hindrance to sustained economic growth. Indeed, Nigeria is the worst ranked country for infrastructure in both regional and global terms. This sad state of affairs is unlikely to change in the forecast period, given the magnitude and long-term nature of the challenges faced. Nigeria's poor infrastructure has been a major constraint on growth since the mid-1970s. Successive governments have failed to deliver on promises to improve and expand basic services in key areas such as power, water, transport, healthcare and education. Gains will be made where the private sector becomes more involved, although significantly developing private-sector investment in many parts of the economy will require politically difficult changes, such as establishing pricing systems that adequately allow for earning profit. For example, notwithstanding the ongoing construction of a 650,000-barrels/day oil refinery near Lagos by a Nigerian billionaire, Aliko Dangote, which is expected to come on stream by 2022, there is little prospect that other private investors will commit to building new refineries in Nigeria as long as petrol subsidies remain in place. The NNPC, which is virtually the sole importer of fuel into the country, showed in its latest financial report that in the 12 months to September 2018 it incurred N731bn (US$2.45bn) in 'under-recovery', which is an implicit petrol subsidy.
Energy policy is the wrong way round
Nigeria will probably remain beset by inadequate power supply over the forecast period. A lack of private investment in the development of power infrastructure and the failure of privatised electricity companies to invest more in upgrading and expanding their deficient facilities are largely due to the government imposing energy price ceilings that do not allow for cost recovery. Similarly, the main reason that thermal power-generating stations have been hampered for years by shortages of gas supplies-in a country with abundant natural gas reserves-is that official gas prices have been too low to entice companies to invest in developing the costly infrastructure needed to harness gas for domestic use. The ERGP states that the gas pricing structure will be reviewed to recover all prudent costs as services improve, but government officials and investors will invariably have different views on what constitute "prudent costs". Policymakers also seem to have got the relationship between pricing and service improvement the wrong way round. To begin providing a better service, companies often need to generate more revenue to invest in the physical and human resources required to achieve the desired improvements. The APC's manifesto for 2019 pledges to pursue the expansion of electricity generation and distribution to up to 40 GW, up from installed capacity of 12.5 GW now. As with previous Nigerian governments that aimed to reach the 40 GW target by 2020, the goal of the current administration is ambitious, given current levels of production; actual peak output has not reached much above 5,000 MW in recent years, owing in part to inadequate transmission capability. The administration has promised to further liberalise power generation and supply and seek to establish an efficient cost-recovery tariff system. As this would inevitably mean large tariff hikes-with regular follow-up increases to take high inflation into account-it is doubtful that it will muster the political will to allow for an independent, market-driven pricing system. However, such a system is needed to make electricity production and distribution viable businesses and to improve the creditworthiness of existing utilities to enable them to invest.
Railways expensive in a challenging business environment
After several decades of decline in the railway network, the revival at the start of 2013 of the 1,126-km Lagos-Kano line, after a ten-year closure, marked the first significant result of multiple government plans aimed at improving rail transport. However, Nigeria's railway revival has not been fast or cheap. In his first term, Mr Buhari asked parliament for approval to borrow US$5.85bn from China to continue the modernisation of the network. An additional issue is that although infrastructure funding from China has the potential to provide capital, precedent shows that the announcement of large Chinese funding lines does not match up to actual disbursements as projects become bogged down in Nigeria's difficult operating environment.

Nigeria scores poorly in this category, reflecting a lack of formal-sector innovation compared with more developed peers. Patent applications and research-and-development (R&D) expenditure are low, and linkages between universities and the corporate sector in the field of technology are lacking. Mobile-phone ownership and internet usage are high, but these are largely concentrated in urban hubs; millions of Nigerians in rural areas lack a reliable telecommunications network. Few-if any-of these shortcomings are set to improve much in the coming years, with Nigeria's score and ranking remaining low in the forecast period.
Mixed prospects for mobile services
Mobile-phone subscriptions reached a peak of 174m in January 2019, but dropped slightly to 173.7m in the following month. After several years of phenomenal growth, from only 19m subscribers in 2005, the development of the telecoms industry now hinges on the challenge of expanding services profitably beyond largely urban markets, and many rural markets are relatively unpenetrated. Although there are high concentrations of subscribers in some states, especially in the south-west, many states in more remote parts of the country have low subscription rates. For example, Lagos state, with a population of 12.1m people, had 23.1m active subscriptions in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from 19.4m a year earlier. In contrast, fewer than 60% of the populations of Bayelsa state (in the oil-producing Niger Delta region), Ebonyi state (in the south-east) and Borno state (in the north-east) had subscriptions, and the number of subscriptions in Zamfara state (in the north-west) was equivalent to just half of the population. As mobile subscriptions approach saturation levels in urban areas, telecoms firms will have a greater incentive to grapple with the challenges of extending and improving their networks in less accessible parts of the country. There has been steady growth in mobile internet subscription in Nigeria over the past seven years, with the notable exemption of the period of economic recession in 2016. Active internet subscriptions totalled 114.8m in February 2019, up from 100.9m a year earlier and only 28m in September 2012. Less progress has been made in expanding fixed-broadband access that provides high-speed connectivity vital for industrialisation in a digital age. According to latest data available from the International Telecommunication Union, fixed broadband subscriptions in Nigeria rose to a peak of 110,834 (just 0.06% of the population) in 2017, from 107,931 in 2016. As with voice telephony, access to the internet is uneven across the country, with the highest numbers of users in the south-west, and many of the country's more remote states struggling to get connected. The challenge of expanding infrastructure (profitably) to often remote locations blighted by insecurity will remain a limiting factor.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be sought out. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies, and Mr Buhari will not willingly attempt to dismantle consumer price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system will be off-putting to investors fearing a return of capital controls. Concerns about this will be heightened whenever global crude prices soften and foreign reserves decline (as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects in 2019-20). Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but again no structural reforms (such as full or partial privatisation) will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC become profitable rather than relinquish state control over them entirely. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint-ventures that it has with international oil companies, but the difficulty of operating in Nigeria and uncertainty about fiscal terms (with deep political divisions about how to distribute hydrocarbons revenue having stalled critical legislation). As a result, investor interest will be short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off assets for a low price. As a consequence, the NNPC will remain dominant, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators

Government revenue 3.1 3.0 3.1 3.5 3.6 3.7
Budget balance -2.6 -2.3 -2.1 -1.8 -1.8 -2.0
Government debt 15.9 17.1 18.4 18.7 19.1 19.7
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout 2019-23. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise by raising consumer taxes and collecting overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Instability in many parts of the country will be another impediment to collection. Hydrocarbons earnings will be held back by petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue), and budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example, in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day (b/d)-a level not seen for well over a decade, and one that will be unobtainable, given underinvestment, militancy and antiquated oil infrastructure. Despite a new offshore oilfield coming on stream, total production stood at 1.64m b/d in February. Federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.7% of GDP, a ratio attained only in 2023 when oil prices are at their highest in the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the roll-out of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, flexibility on spending will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit equal to 2% of GDP over 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.

Long-term interest rate (av) 11.0 13.8 12.5 10.1 9.8 9.7
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20, notwithstanding small rate cut by the CBN in March. Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise over 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above-or-around target. However, real interest rates will be too high to support private-sector activity outside of highly profitable ventures.

The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2020-21 the economy will be held back by falling oil prices, which will dent investor confidence (as lower oil prices heighten fears of capital controls being imposed to protect foreign liquidity), as well as high inflation and tight credit conditions, notwithstanding a recent 50 basis point drop in the policy rate. In 2020 a slowdown in the global economy will also hold back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and external demand picks up, the rate of growth will quicken, although remain well below potential at an annual average of 3.3%. This is still abnormally low for Nigeria, especially as population growth of 2.6% a year is forecast for the 2019-23 forecast period.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will be a new driver of output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism affecting trade, tight credit conditions affecting areas such as real estate and finance, and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Even amid a lower price environment compared with the boom years of the early 2010s, Nigeria's oil and gas sector will remain crucial to the prospects of the wider economy, dominating the export profile and accounting for the majority of government revenue. Nevertheless, despite the best intentions of reformists in government, oil production is unlikely to stage a rapid recovery following a slump in investment in recent years, amid policy uncertainty over fiscal terms (with the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, having languished in parliament since the start of the century) and rising militancy by local groups seeking greater control of oil revenue. This lack of investment means that in spite of the oil sector being a source of great financial windfall for Nigeria, the infrastructure that supports it is old and rickety.
Achieving a workable consensus between the various political and economic interest groups that depend on the oil industry will probably continue to confound policymakers. The PIB includes provisions to create a national oil company that is self-financing and profit-driven; to enshrine greater transparency and openness in the management of oil resources; to protect the environment; and to alter revenue-sharing. However, successive governments have failed to implement the legislation, given the conflicting demands of the various stakeholders. The multinational petroleum companies responsible for most of Nigeria's hydrocarbon output oppose the PIB's proposed increase in the government's take of oil profits, claiming that it would deter investment in the industry. However, Nigerian officials and civil groups have long complained that their nation has been under-rewarded for its oil production, particularly from offshore deposits. With global oil prices now substantially lower than they were when the PIB was initially brought before parliament, the government is under even greater pressure to maximise its share of oil profits. But divisions within the legislature-and between parliament and the executive over how Nigeria's oil dividend should be shared-still impede progress.
Gradual overhaul of oil sector makes some progress
The Buhari administration has taken a slightly different approach, breaking the bill up into smaller parts. This initially yielded some progress, with the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) being passed by parliament in early 2018, but it was later rejected by the president without explanation. A credible explanation is that the oil minister would have been stripped of some decision-making powers under the arrangement. In practice this brings the reform process back to square one. Even if the PIGB were to be passed, it is a subset of larger legislation and does not begin to tackle the more controversial aspects of the original PIB, including how petroleum is taxed and funding for the development of host communities. These omitted issues will be dealt with in subsequent bills, but the further delay in establishing new fiscal terms for upstream operations will continue to generate uncertainty that undermines the industry's investment prospects. The PIB proposed that 10% of the net profit of upstream oil firms be paid into a fund for the development of oil-producing areas, and the failure to actualise the plan is one of the grievances of militants in the Niger Delta, who demand local control of mineral resources or a greater share of the country's oil wealth. However, politicians from non-oil states, especially in the north, oppose this provision. Opponents argue that increasing the slice of oil revenue allocated to oil-producing states, which are already entitled to a 13% oil-derivation payment, will disadvantage non-oil parts of the country by reducing the amount of federal revenue available for them. They argue that some of these areas are as needy (if not more so) and susceptible to political instability as the oil-producing Niger Delta.
Gas production could be scaled up if pricing issues are resolved
Nigeria's proven gas reserves, both oil- and non-oil-associated, are among the largest in the world. In the gas sector the key issue is flaring; a succession of deadlines to end wastage has been missed in recent years, and the next deadline for 2020 is unlikely to be met, with many firms still employing the practice. There is therefore intense competition to find commercial outlets for gas. The government hopes to use much of the new gas production coming on stream to fuel domestic power stations, thus easing the electricity crisis. However, pricing remains an issue, as despite government pledges to increase the price that it pays for gas, prices on the export market remain more attractive for companies in the sector.

Unit labour costs 12.9 9.6 5.2 10.0 10.5 11.1
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will increase to 12.7% in 2019, as a 67% increase in the minimum wage combines with recently loosened monetary policy. A small devaluation in the naira expected later in the year will add to upward price pressures. Inflation will remain elevated, at 11.4% on average in 2020, as demand-side forces from the minimum wage hike continue and the currency weakens further in that year. As the currency stabilises, inflation will ease over the rest of the forecast period to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Conflict and supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's agricultural heartland-will prevent a faster slide, together with widening protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food and manufactured goods. Currently 43 items are barred from foreign-exchange access, the most recent addition being textiles, and the CBN wants to increase the list to 50 as a means of stimulating non-oil activity.

We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. For this reason the set-up is not expected to be tampered with. Oil prices will in large part dictate where the authorities are able to hold the official rate and what the premium is between it and market-sensitive rates. In 2019 lower oil prices, as well as looser monetary policy and high inflation, will cause the market-determined Nafex rate to drop and the official rate with it, from N306.5:US$1 at end-2018 to N319.5:US$1 at end-2019. With oil prices forecast to decline again in 2020 we expect a further fall in the value of the naira, to N337:US$1 at end-2020. As oil prices pick up on average over the rest of the forecast period and petroleum exports increase as a new refinery comes on stream, we broadly expect the naira to stabilise, with an average rate of N338.4:US$1 in 2023.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing, has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.

The export profile will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. In 2019-20 limited output gains will be outweighed by a drop in world crude prices and pipeline disruptions. Only in 2021-23 when prices recover and Nigeria begins to sell refined oil overseas (a new mega-refinery being developed is expected to be export-oriented) will there be any growth in earnings.
As Nigeria imports most of its petrol, lower world crude prices will ease pressure on the import bill in 2019-20. In 2019 there will be a sharp drop in imports relative to 2018, when there was a one-off surge in capital goods imports. Wider restrictions on foreign-exchange access and a weakening naira will also hold back consumer demand. In 2020 world oil prices will decline further and the naira will continue to depreciate, causing imports to flatline in that year. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23, the naira stabilises and world oil (and so petrol) prices rise, imports will then grow faster. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will broadly track movements in global oil prices, narrowing from 1.8% of GDP in 2019 to 0.7% of GDP in 2020, then widening again to 2.4% of GDP by 2023.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Nigeria
Stocks and flows
Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Nigeria in 2018, at US$2bn, were less than a quarter of levels registered a decade earlier. In particular, a steep decline has been occurring since the partial liberalisation of the exchange rate since April 2017; although exporters and investors can now access foreign exchange at market-determined rates, the central bank maintains an overvalued policy conversion. Although this window accounts for only a small proportion of total foreign-exchange transactions, it allows targeted (or at least well-connected) industries and suppliers access to hard currency cheaply and so has clear political importance (for example, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation budgets for petroleum imports at the official rate, which allows it to subsidise retail sales). Given this, investors are apprehensive about the possible return to capital controls should oil prices fall and the new multiple exchange-rate system become untenable. Short-term capital inflows have been relatively unaffected and even surged in 2018 (a product of high yields on Treasury bills and improved confidence about shorter investment cycles), but long-dated securities and FDI have registered a notable downturn. The stock of FDI in 2018 was US$99.8bn, which as a percentage of GDP equated to 23.6%, down from 28% in 2016.
Origin and distribution
Most FDI inflows into Nigeria are from the oil multinationals. Until the oil price crash in 2015-16 there had been a modest surge in non-oil-sector foreign investment after it became clear that civilian democracy and macroeconomic stability had become established. Although much of the investment was by large multinational companies that were already operating in the country, South African companies strongly increased their presence, with Asian companies leading the next wave. However, the challenging market has seen some prominent withdrawals by South African firms and international banks and greater caution by Asian investors. In sum, the initial flurry of interest peaked some time ago.
Determinants
The main factors attracting investment by oil firms are low production costs and high-quality crude oil, both of which offset economic problems and political instability. A number of gas projects have moved ahead, stimulated by abundant supplies, growing demand and the government's policy goal of eliminating gas flaring. So far, privatisation has been a stop-start process. However, the opening-up of the mobile-phone market has been a success. Otherwise, the main rationale for investment by multinationals is to establish a presence in Africa's largest market, which could be highly profitable despite the difficult operating environment.
Impact
The energy sector, which has received most foreign investment to date, provides the majority of government revenue and the vast majority of foreign-exchange earnings. However, it is also a capital-intensive sector with limited linkages to the rest of the economy and little effect on employment. One area in which FDI has had a high-profile impact is mobile-phone networks, led by MTN of South Africa. However, MTN fell foul of regulators over its failure to register SIM card users during 2015 and again in 2018 over alleged non-compliance with capital repatriation requirements. Both have resulted in large fines. This is likely to make investors more wary.
Potential
With the largest economy and population in Africa, Nigeria is an important market, although the awkward business environment-characterised by impenetrable bureaucracy and idiosyncratic regulation-is likely to keep FDI inflows below potential. Established multinationals that have mastered operating in the complex and chaotic regulatory environment make substantial profits, despite the country's low income levels and the logistical difficulties caused by the almost non-existent infrastructure, which obliges companies to provide their own power and water supplies and to distribute goods on a road system that is in poor repair. The government will continue to promote Nigeria as a rewarding target for foreign investment, especially for the commercial exploitation of a range of minerals. The privatisation programme will have a relatively high profile over the next few years, but progress is likely to remain erratic. Parastatals are an important source of patronage, and privatisation faces considerable political opposition, as it is often associated with large-scale job losses. However, the failure of public enterprises to provide an adequate level of service, notably in the electricity and water sectors, and the successful liberalisation of the telephone market make privatisation almost inevitable.

Nigeria will have a population of over 222m in 2023, ensuring that it remains by far the most populous nation in Africa; it accounts for almost half of the population of the West Africa region and about 20% of the Sub-Saharan region. Nigeria has a very young population, with over 40% under 15 years of age and almost 2m entering the job market each year.
Underemployment is more of an issue than unemployment
The population growth rate will be high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile, but such a youthful population will have difficulty in finding suitable employment within the formal economy. However, it is not unemployment that is the main issue; few Nigerians in the labour force can afford not to work in a country with no government social security support for the unemployed. Instead, the main challenges are underemployment and low pay. For this reason the local definition of unemployment is working less than 20 hours a week. This suggests that the task facing the government is not so much job creation as the implementation of reforms to help to raise productivity and enable employers and employees to upskill existing jobs. Indeed, the country's ability to capitalise on this demographic opportunity will depend on raising health, employment and educational standards, on which only gradual progress can be expected. With the participation rate increasing gradually, largely as a result of more women entering the workforce, the pressure on the job market will be keenly felt throughout the forecast period.
Much will depend on the manufacturing and services sectors, but the prospects are mixed. The oil and gas sector will remain capital- rather than labour-intensive, and a gradual switch from subsistence to commercial farming is likely to result in less employment in agriculture rather than more, as hoped by the government. Many young Nigerians will have to resort to low-paid work in the informal sector, but others are likely to turn to crime or militancy-another challenge for policymakers.
Rapid urbanisation will present a challenge
A further problem will be to provide enough housing for young Nigerians leaving home. Given that the government's efforts to boost house-building are expected to make only limited progress, owing to inefficiency and capacity bottlenecks, the number of slums and the level of resentment are likely to grow. This issue will be intensified by ongoing urbanisation. The share of the urban population will surpass 55% of the total in the forecast period, up from 36% in the 1991 census. This will strain the capacity of municipal authorities to provide adequate services. Nevertheless, competition for the best agricultural and grazing grounds will continue in some parts of the country. Access to land has been a key source of violence in the country's "middle belt", and this is set to continue.
Weak infrastructure compounds health challenges
Although the reported incidence of HIV/AIDS is relatively low in Nigeria, with UNAIDS putting the prevalence rate in 2015 at 3.1%, the country's large population means that Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of sufferers of the disease in the world. Furthermore, there are geographical pockets of infection where the level is above 20% of the sexually active population, and there are major differences in the prevalence rate between states. Other health concerns include the high incidence of malaria, tuberculosis and Guinea worm disease. Furthermore, there have been outbreaks of measles and cholera across parts of northern Nigeria that have led to local healthcare infrastructure being decimated by insecurity. Internally displaced persons' camps often have poor hygiene and are lacking in medicines and medical equipment. More positively, in mid-2015 Nigeria celebrated one year without a case of polio, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to remove it from the handful of endemic countries in September of the same year. A few isolated cases were reported during mid-2016, showing that the fight is not yet over-especially as insecurity will remain a persistent threat where these diseases are most prevalent. However, the WHO projects the complete eradication of the disease in the country by 2020. In other, more prosperous areas of the country, diseases associated with improving living standards are also a growing issue; for example, 1.56m Nigerians suffer from diabetes-a figure that looks likely to increase, given weak healthcare provision.

Market potential is high, but the operating context will be unfavourable
With Africa's largest economy (or second largest, depending on the exchange rate used) and highest population, Nigeria will grow in importance as a market for many multinationals. However, its attractiveness over the next five years should not be overstated. Extremely low income levels for the majority of the population will continue to mean that most people have little to spend on goods other than basic necessities. Furthermore, owing to low economic growth GDP per head in US dollar terms will only recover to 2014 levels by 2023. Nevertheless, Nigeria's growing middle class and wealthy elite-the sizes of which dwarf those in most other African countries-will remain important markets. Nigeria is potentially a profitable market for multinational companies that know how to operate in its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and have overcome the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure, for example by providing their own (expensive) power and water supplies.
As the problems associated with working in Nigeria substantially push up the cost of operations (particularly given low productivity), competition from low-cost imports will remain an issue. Providing goods through imports may seem a more attractive option for many companies seeking to exploit the market. However, given the authorities' desire for control over the exchange rate, foreign exchange restrictions on various banned import categories will continue to impede business operations.

There will be little shift in spending patterns amid economic hardship
Given the country's low level of income, consumer expenditure is dominated by the purchase of foodstuffs. Food, beverages and tobacco account for more than half of household expenditure. When spending on fuel, clothing and footwear is taken into account (and given that households also face emergency outlays, for example on healthcare), little disposable income is left for expenditure on other consumer goods, leisure, services, or eating out. These trends will broadly continue in 2019-23, albeit with a faster pace of growth towards the end of the forecast period opening up some new opportunities. There will be some increase in spending on consumer goods, driven largely by the burgeoning middle class, but the vast majority are, and will remain, poor. The middle classes are almost exclusively located in urban areas, with a geographic concentration in the south-west of the country, around the commercial capital, Lagos.

Initial conditions: Although the hydrocarbons sector accounts for just over 10% of GDP (and was at about this level, even before the end of the oil price boom), its performance has a major bearing on overall economic conditions, given its domination of government and export revenue. Consequently, the lower price environment since late 2014 and periodic but severe supply disruptions, caused by labour strikes and sabotage by militant groups, have severely weakened the local economy. The government's ability to spend what oil revenue it does still earn in a way that would benefit the majority of Nigerians is hugely constrained by the extremely weak civil service, high levels of corruption and the requirement that a large proportion of revenue be allocated to states, which are even less accountable than the federal government. Although there is more dynamism in certain parts of the non-oil private sector, such as trade, entertainment, banking and communications, a background of weak infrastructure and decades of underinvestment in healthcare and education means that the initial conditions for the country to enter a period of sustainable and diversified growth are poor.
Population changes bring opportunities, but also threats
Demographic trends: One factor in Nigeria's favour is its large and young population. However, most indicators of the health of the population are low, reflecting decades of underinvestment in healthcare facilities, which will take years to turn around even if the commitment is found. Increasing urbanisation will also put strain on service provision in the cities, as well as housing. An additional problem for the government is provision of education and training facilities for the rapidly growing population, as well as long-term employment opportunities. Internal migration, as Nigerians search for jobs in the urban centres and climate change and environmental degradation (which is fuelling conflict in Nigeria's 'Middle Belt' agricultural heartland) put strain on natural resources, will add to population pressures. Access to land is already a major driver of unrest in central Nigeria, and this phenomenon is only likely to intensify in the coming years. Overall, it is difficult to be optimistic about the outlook without a substantial improvement in economic governance and policy implementation. There is time to turn the situation around over the timeframe to 2050, but the precedent is not positive.
External conditions: There has been a structural shift in Nigeria's export markets in recent years, away from the US, which is steadily reducing its oil imports as result of its shale boom, and towards Asia, particularly India. Oil reserves will not be exhausted by 2050 but are likely to have peaked by then, which will present the additional challenge of finding external markets for the growing non-oil economy. The importance of Nigeria, due to its size and influence on the African continent, means that the international community will retain an interest in political developments in the country and will try to address the issues of insecurity, corruption and poverty. However, Nigeria's oil and gas revenue means that the international community will have limited influence. Without real commitment from the domestic leadership, Western countries will promote largely cosmetic changes rather than more fundamental reforms.
Institutions and policy trends: The real challenge for successive governments is to raise average incomes and living standards through a sustained period of economic reform and to deliver a real improvement in governance. However, the omens are not good. Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt and poorly governed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering how ingrained these problems are, they will be hard to resolve, even in a long-term timeframe. The gap between economic policy rhetoric and implementation will remain huge, and improvements will continue to be slow, given that the vast range of vested interests that benefit from the chaotic status quo remain opposed to change. In addition, policy formulation will continue to be hampered by the country's federal structure; even if a positive reform agenda is promoted at the national level, it is often not implemented or is openly contradicted at the state level.
Long-term performance: Nigeria's long-term economic performance will pick up during 2020-50, albeit at a slower pace in 2018-30 than in 2031-50, given the long-term nature of many of the challenges restricting the country's economic potential. Indeed, growth in real GDP per head will remain below 1% per year in real terms. Although some non-oil sectors will perform well (agriculture has enormous potential, as do retail and communications), others, such as manufacturing, are likely to struggle to become internationally competitive. Income levels will remain low. Moreover, Nigeria's exports and government revenue will continue to be dominated by the hydrocarbons sector. Once the next wave of new developments in the offshore oil and gas sector has run its course, Nigeria will face difficult choices in terms of economic development, and it remains unclear whether fundamental policy decisions can be made and implemented to ensure that the country is able to enter a longer period of sustained and more diversified growth.

Climate change and sustainability
More extreme climate change will have a major adverse impact on not only Nigeria's economy but also the country's stability. With the country already prone to violent unrest across a variety of ethnic, religious, economic and social faultiness, an upturn in the number and severity of events associated with climate change will foster greater upheaval. As a large country spanning a number of differing meteorological zones, the impacts of climate change will be various and unevenly distributed. The country will suffer from greater incidence of desertification, soil erosion, land inundation from rising sea levels and the drying-up of surface freshwater levels. The economic impacts will be mixed. Agriculture accounts for a little over 20% of GDP but employs about two-thirds of the labour force, and the degradation of land will diminish its productivity over time. The knock-on effects on economic growth and personal consumption will be significant. Nigeria has been unable for decades to satisfy total food demand via domestic production alone, and, as climate degradation reduces potential yields, lower food production will drive even higher imports of food (it can be assumed that foreign-exchange restrictions on staple goods such as rice will eventually be lifted as domestic supply falls under local requirements). Rising food costs will fuel higher inflation, further eroding purchasing power, especially with the currency falling as a result of weaker economic conditions. The political and social effects will potentially be even more severe. Shortages of feed and water in the arid and semi-arid savannah regions of northern Nigeria, largely caused by desertification and drought, will drive ever larger numbers of pastoralists southwards and outside their normal grazing routes. This will drive them into greater conflict with local farmers in central Nigeria, who, seeking greater agricultural production, have expanded their crop cultivation into new areas, thereby limiting the land available for herders to graze their stocks. These frictions will cause outbreaks of significant violence. Nigeria already experiences thousands of deaths every year from conflicts over land access, and these numbers will grow notably, especially as we expect little progress by forthcoming governments on the contentious issue of land ownership.
A blockchain revolution
Blockchain technology-in which a continuously growing list of records (blocks) are linked and secured using cryptography-offers a number of advantages for Nigeria, where investors are often deterred and development stifled by challenges ranging from a lack of extensive infrastructure to uncertainty caused by political instability. Notably, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies do not depend on stable governments and balanced budgets in order to guarantee monetary value. A lack of useful civil-service offices, courts, transport hubs and even airports is no barrier to the exchange of data or property on the blockchain, which also offers the potential of an alternative financing system that is both decentralised and multinational. Blockchain technologies offer the potential for greater clarity regarding land and property rights, which could tackle a major barrier to investment in Nigeria, where land ownership is a thorny issue. All of these developments are of course taking place in a global economy, and indigenous efforts to create a critical mass of blockchain developers will be crucial to ensure that the technology remains on the path to innovative advancement in Nigeria. Blockchain solutions imported from other regions are likely to struggle to adapt as well and as rapidly as ones developed locally, and there is a clear risk that Nigerian developers will be lured away to work in places where blockchain technology is currently more established but less necessary. The loss of skilled personnel is a regular challenge for Nigeria, and is unlikely to become less of a problem. There are additional risks around regulatory and security requirements. For example, the ability to transfer large sums of money anonymously and across borders has clear attractions for non-legitimate businesses (as well as corrupt officials). Moreover, the adoption of blockchain technologies might face resistance from vested interests, for whom increased transparency would be an unwelcome development. Nonetheless, the attractions of a technology that allows individuals and firms to bypass stringent capital controls, high currency risk or simply inefficient existing systems are clear, suggesting that take-up in Nigeria is likely to be substantial.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Political stability The government led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) is in its final stage. Since early January 2019 it no longer has a majority in parliament-just 145 out of 300 seats-following the withdrawal of the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the ruling coalition in protest against the Macedonia name-change deal. Since January the government has had to rely on the help of members of the opposition and AE defectors to win votes in parliament. [...]we have revised our monetary policy forecast and now believe that the ECB will not lift its deposit rate until June 2020 (December 2019 previously). EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government, led by Alexis Tsipras of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), is likely to hobble along following the departure of the nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the coalition after the Macedonia name-change deal, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political instability to persist during a busy electoral cycle in 2019 and probably beyond, further weakening Greece's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform.
We now expect that Syriza will cling onto power until the end of the parliamentary term in October to attempt to pass legislation intended to boost its electoral support. However, we expect New Democracy (ND) to win the election, but it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to accrue a majority, complicating the government-formation process.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality in the medium term, until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's international creditors. Mr Tsipras's promises to lower taxes, and reverse spending cuts, could cause tensions with the EU and investors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
After expanding by 1.9% in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to reach 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and an annual average of 2% in 2021-23. Meeting large primary budget surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove to be difficult. Public debt is forecast to be still high, at about 175% of GDP in 2023.
Inflation (EU harmonised) will rise slightly, from 0.8% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019 and 1.1% in 2020, reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and weaker global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to rise, bringing inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect narrower current-account deficits in 2019-23 (the forecast period) compared with an annual average of 7.1% of GDP since 2001.

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period, with progress in almost all categories, apart from political stability. However, Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions, which will constrain real GDP growth, and keep Greece's debt burden high.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% (29% in 2018) and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to an estimated 2.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The government led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) is in its final stage. Since early January 2019 it no longer has a majority in parliament-just 145 out of 300 seats-following the withdrawal of the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the ruling coalition in protest against the Macedonia name-change deal. Since January the government has had to rely on the help of members of the opposition and AE defectors to win votes in parliament. On May 10th it won a confidence vote with external support, the second in less than six months. The Economist Intelligence Unit now expects the Syriza minority government to cling to power until the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019 to try to pass legislation aimed at boosting its electoral support before the next general election. We had previously expected a snap election before October, possibly in conjunction with local and European Parliament elections that will be held on May 26th.
Ahead of the next general election political instability has intensified owing to the agreement with Macedonia to change that country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. This will continue to hamper government effectiveness, and commitment to political and economic reform beyond Greece's busy 2019 electoral cycle. We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms could lead to renewed tensions with Greece's EU creditors.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Despite Greece's exit in August 2018 from the third economic adjustment programme that the Syriza-led government signed in 2015, Mr Tsipras's party continues to trail the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, by more than 10 percentage points in opinion polls from the past few months. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, which is likely to have increased owing to the Macedonia name-change deal, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a majority in parliament.
Turnout in Greece at local and European Parliament elections tends to be significantly lower than at general elections, and voters are more likely to show support for smaller parties. However, the elections in late May will be a significant bellwether for the next general election.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability, as well as protracted economic and financial crises, have limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans. Recent government efforts to restore influence on the international scene, including the Macedonia name-change deal and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. Ratification of the name-change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership, but the leader of ND has said that, if elected, his government would seek to renegotiate the deal.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey will persist. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Turkey's release in August 2018 of two Greek soldiers arrested in March of that year while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line. In June 2018 Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked for early repayment of a more expensive tranche of IMF debt-due to be completed in July 2019-and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover the country's financing needs to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
However, the government will still be subject to severe policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond, until its huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was about 182% of GDP at end-2018, and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance will be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries.
The implementation of further debt-relief measures also agreed with Greece's EU creditors in June 2018 will be conditional on quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments, the most pressing of which include tackling Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, reviving the government's privatisation programme, removing remaining capital controls and clearing state arrears to the private sector. Greece has also committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. As the quarterly reviews will be published (the most recent was released on February 27th and updated on April 4th), transgression by Greece could adversely affect market access. The debt-relief measures include a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). Greece will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2019-22.
In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. After a three-year absence Greece has tapped the financial markets five times since July 2017, most recently in early March 2019 with a well-subscribed ten-year issue, yielding 3.9%. The spread on the secondary market between Greek ten-year government bonds and equivalent German government bonds has narrowed steadily in recent months, but it remains large at about 360 basis points in early May. Amid rising domestic political instability ahead of the next general election in Greece, as well as growing global economic and financial uncertainty, further bond issuance will be challenging.
In the medium and long term, the political and-arguably-the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past four years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
After almost a decade of austerity Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 1.1% of GDP and a primary surplus of close to 4.5% in 2018, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 3.5%. From 2019, however, we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits from 2020 and primary surpluses falling short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint ahead of the next general election and only moderate economic growth. There is also uncertainty about the application of the Council of State's ruling that previous pension and bonus cuts implemented in 2016 were unconstitutional, raising the risk of retroactive payments. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-18 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be about 175% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below; it also launched an asset-purchase programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn and came to an end in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the forecast period, as the ECB will reinvest principal payments from maturing securities past the date on which it starts tightening. Euro zone inflation pressures remain low and downside risks to the euro zone's economic outlook remain pronounced. As a result, we have revised our monetary policy forecast and now believe that the ECB will not lift its deposit rate until June 2020 (December 2019 previously). An increase in the main refinancing rate should follow in December 2020. At its last meeting, on April 10th, the ECB signalled that it was considering introducing a tiered deposit system under which a portion of deposits at the central bank would be exempted from the deposit rate, which is currently -0.4%. The ECB's recent communication aims to show that it can hold rates at record-low levels for longer, or even cut them further later this year if necessary. Policy tightening should proceed at a gradual pace from 2021. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The Greek economy is recovering from a protracted slump, but the recovery is modest and vulnerable to domestic, and external, developments. As at 2018 real GDP was still more than 25% below pre-crisis levels in 2007 levels, government consumption by almost one-quarter lower, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. Real GDP accelerated from 1.4% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final three months of last year, contracting by 0.1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained, at 1.8% in 2019 and 2020, and at an annual average of about 2% in 2021-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
A combination of more-and higher-taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts will continue to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2019-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 12% year on year in 2018. We expect a pick-up from this year, to an annual average of 5.2% in 2019-23. Underinvestment during the economic crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of about 4.6% in 2019-23, down from 8.8% in 2018. However, the Greek tourism sector faces considerable challenges that range from the UK's planned departure from the EU and increased competition from Turkey to insufficient public investment.
How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country remains in the euro zone. Although the risk of Grexit has abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and a sharp decreases in global oil prices in the final quarter of 2018 will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect inflation to rise modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 1.2% per year in 2019-20 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 on the back of the region's economic recovery and rising expectations of quantitative easing tapering. However, since peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, in part owing to monetary tightening in the US last year. Since the start of 2019 the euro has weakened further, hovering around US$1.12:EUR1-US$1.14:EUR1, as high-frequency data and soft indicators continue to disappoint market expectations and point to a weaker euro zone outlook. We expect the euro to start strengthening again towards the end of the year, as we expect growth to firm in the second half. We have revised our forecast for 2019 to US$1.14:EUR1 (US$1.16:EUR1 previously). The euro will resume its appreciation against the dollar from 2020, reaching US$1.20:EUR1 on average in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is tightened gradually and growth in the US softens, and US$1.24:EUR1 in 2022-23 supported by the large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but also partly of improved competitiveness, particularly in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2019-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: [...]bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration. According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. [...]we have revised up slightly our forecast for real GDP growth in Canada next year to 1.6% (previously 1.5%). [...]the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October 2019 election, but fallout from the controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case means that the result will be tighter than previously envisaged.
The renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced trade uncertainty, although the new agreement has yet to be ratified. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its key export market.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. We expect it to keep rates on hold in 2019-20, owing to the weaker economy and housing market, and the benign outlook for inflation. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7% in 2019, from 2.2% in 2018, reflecting generally lower oil prices. Inflationary pressures will ease further in 2020, in line with a subdued economy, before picking up again from 2021 as economic growth regains some momentum.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.8% in 2018 to 1.6% in both 2019 and 2020 as private consumption growth moderates and an economic slowdown in the US dampens export demand. Real GDP growth will average 2.1% per year in 2021-23.

Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.
2021-23: The government completes its update of financial legislation, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
The labour market
2019-20: Canada will enact policies to streamline processes and increase quotas to expedite the hiring of foreign talent by companies.
2021-23: The government further encourages the entry of skilled workers and professionals by raising its immigration target.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Plans to construct new oil pipelines from Alberta progress slowly, as the projects face opposition from environmental groups.
2021-23: After years of uncertainty, pipelines to carry energy resources from Alberta begin to come on stream.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The technology sector benefits from workers moving from the US, especially those on that country's H1B visas, for whom the political climate becomes more difficult.
2021-23: Expertise in artificial intelligence takes root, particularly in the academic centres of Toronto and Montreal.

Background: The Canadian economy was the ninth-largest in the world in 2017 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 76% of its goods exports and is the source of about 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue, just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French-speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the main parties in contention to lead the provincial government after the 2018 election is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party heads a majority government since winning the general election in 2015.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. As at 2019 the top federal income-tax rate, on taxable income above C$210,371 (US$157,300), is 33%.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$16.6bn in 2018 and the current-account deficit was US$45.5bn (2.7% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau, has shifted Canadian politics to the left since it won a majority at the 2015 election. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects challenges to policy initiatives and friction with provincial administrations to intensify ahead of the next federal election, due in October 2019. The ongoing controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case also risks permanently tarnishing Mr Trudeau's political brand.
The political scandal centres on allegations by the former attorney-general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, that Mr Trudeau and his officials put inappropriate political pressure on her to abandon the criminal prosecution for fraud of SNC-Lavalin, a large, Quebec-based construction and engineering firm. In late March Ms Wilson-Raybould provided the parliamentary justice committee with a secret recording of a telephone conversation between herself and the clerk of the Privy Council, from December 2018. In that conversation the clerk highlighted the prime minister's concerns about the damaging impact of a prosecution on SNC-Lavalin, continuing a debate that had been under way internally for months about the option of proceeding under a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have let the company off with a fine. Ms Wilson-Raybould refused to intervene, and the company faces the prospect of a trial.
The secret taping angered many Liberal members of parliament, who believed that it was time for Mr Trudeau to act, after weeks of him and other Liberals trying to broker a compromise with Ms Wilson-Raybould. She had quit the cabinet in February. Another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, followed suit in March. Citing the unwillingness of the pair to state that they had confidence in him and his government, Mr Trudeau expelled them from caucus on April 2nd and indicated that they could not run as Liberals in the federal election. Just as it seemed that the Liberals had drawn a line under the issue, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer, revealed on April 7th that he had received a letter from Mr Trudeau's lawyer, threatening to sue him for libel over his comments relating to Mr Trudeau's role in the controversy. The affair is likely to result in further political fallout for the government and give added momentum to the Conservatives in the lead-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments will intensify following the election in April of a United Conservative Party provincial government in Alberta and a minority Progressive Conservative Party provincial government in Prince Edward Island. On April 1st the Trudeau administration imposed a carbon tax in four provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. This will be extended to Alberta, when the new premier, Jason Kenney, repeals the carbon tax in the province. The imposition of the carbon tax in these provinces, and the nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which is fundamentally opposed by the provincial government in British Columbia (BC), has raised questions over federal jurisdiction.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Political fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair has seen the Conservatives edge ahead of the Liberals in opinion polls since February. However, we still expect the Liberal Party to form the government after the federal election due by October 2019. This reflects the advantages of incumbency, the renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has helped to ease trade uncertainty, and the legalisation of cannabis. However, the Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and are building momentum under Mr Scheer. They will be further boosted by the victories of provincial colleagues in the Alberta and Prince Edward Island elections in April. At the federal level, the Conservatives will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes and government spending. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing 40,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum. The profile of the New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Jagmeet Singh, will be lifted by his election to parliament in February. However, the NDP trails well behind the two larger parties in terms of fundraising ahead of the election. The Conservatives are in the best shape in this regard.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Under the Liberals, Canadian foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. This is in clear contrast to the policies pursued by Donald Trump's administration in the US. As a result, bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration. Canada will, nonetheless, seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far. Where possible, Canada will attempt to circumvent the White House by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The successful negotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA and preserve the trilateral arrangement, mitigates significant trade risk for Canada. The new agreement was signed in November 2018 and is awaiting ratification by the three governments. However, there is a significant risk of delay from the US side. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier US-Mexico deal. In particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which Canada relies on to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. The new deal grants the US greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are also managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). This concession is broadly similar to what Canada had offered during negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, from which the US withdrew in 2017. In another move that should ease regional trade tension, Canada negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to key Asian markets over the forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines. With full implementation, the figure is set to rise to 99%.
China was a key target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities. Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. On March 1st the Canadian government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition, and shortly afterwards China blocked canola (rapeseed) imports from two Canadian canola producers, on the grounds of biosecurity concerns. We expect tensions to persist throughout 2019, preventing progress on exploratory free-trade talks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Canada will continue supporting domestic industries that are negatively affected by US trade protectionism. In 2018 the finance minister, Bill Morneau, announced measures to increase the competitiveness of Canadian businesses after the introduction of tax cuts in the US at the start of last year. These included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. Environmental policy will also be important in the remainder of the parliamentary term. Government support for the fossil fuel industry is crucial for economic growth in the short and medium term but appears incompatible with the federal government's green credentials. The Liberal Party will continue to seek a balance between these two objectives to preserve its voter base. On the one hand, the government has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20/tonne (US$15/tonne) in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. The federal tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. However, the consensus on taxing carbon emissions seems to be weakening as opposition mounts. On the other hand, the federal government supports the controversial expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline (which it now owns). The expansion, which is designed to enable higher volumes of crude oil from Alberta to be transported to a port in BC, is deeply unpopular with environmentalists and opposed by the BC government. The final decision on whether to proceed with the project has been postponed until June, but could be delayed again, given the looming election.
Policymakers will continue to keep a close eye on the property market, which remains a key risk owing to recent monetary policy tightening and overleveraged Canadian households. Following the imposition of tighter mortgage-lending requirements since 2016, the market appears to be rebalancing as the quality of new mortgage lending improves. Price growth has slowed markedly, with some measures showing a dip in house prices in late 2018/early 2019, although trends vary across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but this will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the introduction of the carbon tax and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018 will weigh on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit, as increased government support will be expected to shore up the economy and government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. Official projections show the budget deficit declining to C$9.8bn, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, by 2023/24. We estimate that the fiscal deficit stood at 0.9% of GDP in 2018 (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based), and expect it to expand slightly, to 1.1% of GDP, in 2019 as the government looks to support the fossil fuels industry through rebates and additional incentives amid a softer price environment. In 2020 the government will respond to continued weak growth with additional fiscal spending, which will push the deficit up to 1.3% of GDP. The government will look to narrow the deficit in the longer term, and we expect it to fall gradually, to 0.7% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points between July 2017 and October 2018, in response to rising inflation and tightening monetary policy in the US. However, it has kept rates steady at its last four scheduled interest-rate meetings, owing in part to lower energy prices, which have pushed down the headline inflation rate. The central bank indicated in October that interest rates would need to rise over time to a neutral rate of between 2.5% and 3.5%, to keep inflation at around the BoC's 2% target and discourage highly indebted households from accumulating further debt. The central bank lowered its assessment of the neutral range to between 2.25% and 3.25% in the monetary policy report that accompanied the latest rate decision on April 24th, and signalled that it was in no hurry to lift rates.
Given the benign outlook for inflation, weak household spending growth, the softer housing market and signs of a loss in global economic momentum, we expect the BoC to leave the policy rate unchanged throughout 2019. We forecast that rates will remain on hold in 2020 as US growth weakens further, which, because of the two countries' interlinkages, will cause economic growth in Canada to slow. Modest monetary tightening will resume in 2021 and continue for the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to 1.8% in 2018, from 3% in 2017. This reflected weaker growth in most GDP components, notably private consumption and business investment, although export growth picked up. We expect real GDP growth to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. Previous monetary tightening and high household debt levels will dampen private consumption growth this year, and export growth is also expected to moderate, as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's key export market.
Much of 2018 was characterised by the escalating trade dispute with the US. The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the key downside risks to our forecast, although the agreement has yet to be ratified, and the steel and aluminium tariffs imposed on Canada by the US in 2018 remain in place for now. Other risks to the economic outlook include a renewed drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
Growth in the US and world trade will continue to lose steam in 2020, although we expect the slowdown to be more modest than previously forecast. As a result, we have revised up slightly our forecast for real GDP growth in Canada next year to 1.6% (previously 1.5%). Economic expansion in Canada is expected to pick up again in 2021, and real GDP growth will average 2.1% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued government spending on infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices until October 2018 and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures for much of 2018, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation picked up to an average of 2.2%. The headline inflation rate fell back to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, below the BoC's 2% target rate, owing to lower petrol prices, although core inflation was 1.9%. We expect the headline inflation rate to average a benign 1.7% in 2019, reflecting the lagged effect of previous monetary tightening by the central bank, slowing export demand and generally lower oil prices. Subdued economic growth in 2020 will lead to a further easing in the inflation rate next year, before it picks up again from 2021 as the economy strengthens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Tighter monetary policy, a broader improvement in the global economy and the draining of the surplus in the oil market lent support to the Canadian dollar in the first half of 2018, although falling oil prices have weighed on the currency in recent months. We expect the Canadian dollar to depreciate further against its US counterpart, from a full-year average of C$1.30:US$1 in 2018 to C$1.35:US$1 in 2019 and C$1.38:US$1 in 2020, reflecting weaker global oil prices, softer economic growth and a more dovish approach from the BoC, which we now expect will leave its policy rate unchanged in 2019-20. A pick-up in growth from 2021, and the resumption of monetary tightening, will underpin an appreciation in the Canadian dollar over the remainder of the forecast period, with the currency forecast to average C$1.30:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which we expect will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period. The CPTPP, the effects of which will first be felt at the start of the next decade, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. We expect that this will help to narrow the current-account deficit to 2.3% of GDP in 2023.
