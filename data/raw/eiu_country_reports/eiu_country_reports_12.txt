Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority in parliament with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and possibly beyond.
Following the June elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016, there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will remain tense. Points of contention include Turkey's pivot towards Iran and Russia (from the US perspective), and the perceived lack of US support after the failed coup (from Turkey's perspective).
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to about 3.5% per year in 2018-23, reflecting the impact of the August 2018 currency crisis, higher interest rates, global trade tensions and more moderate export growth.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.3:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.6% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

a Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election, a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow down the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current-account deficit of US$47.5bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were very similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023-and possibly beyond this.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms. These are similar to those of the state of emergency, which was introduced after the attempted coup, in a bid to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies. These include the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the coup plot.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, which increased the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. The formation of a governing coalition between the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. The MHP will advocate the repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
On June 24th parliamentary and presidential elections were held, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote after a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. The AKP received 42.6% of the vote, the MHP 11.1%, the Republican People's Party (CHP) 22.6%, the HDP 11.7% and the Good Party (IP) 10%.
Local elections are planned in March 2019. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in the mood for an election until next year. The AKP and the MHP look unlikely to co-operate in the local elections after disagreements regarding the selection process for mayoral candidates in large cities.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; and US sanctions on Turkish government officials owing to Turkey's detention of a US pastor on terrorist charges (sanctions have been lifted in November after the pastor was released in October). The government's authoritarian tendencies and confrontational approach (partly motivated by Mr Erdogan's need to appeal to nationalists) have also damaged relations with Turkey's Western allies.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations. Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq; the fact that Mr Erdogan visited Germany in late September lends credence to this view. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO (not our core forecast).
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Relations between Turkey and Russia have improved in the past two years, but the level of trust is still low. In September Turkey and Russia announced an agreement to create-and jointly patrol-a demilitarised zone in Idlib, the last rebel-held governorate in northern Syria. However, this does not alter our view that they are co-operating in Syria while pursuing contrasting goals (Russia backs the government led by Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and Turkey provides support to rebels). As a result, we expect relations to continue to be transactional. The risk of new tensions will remain high.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business, and investment, climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised, effectively regulated banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private business sector.
In the aftermath of the failed coup in July 2016 a highly accommodative policy stance has exacerbated fiscal as well as external imbalances. This, together with heightened political uncertainty, the tightening of global liquidity conditions and tensions with the US, led to a currency crisis in August 2018. The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically over the past decade will remain a predominant feature over our forecast period (2019-23), at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. This approach will continue to have an important effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a key factor behind the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options will remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support, partly because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia is at odds. Meanwhile, an IMF programme would include what the government would regard as an unacceptable conditionality and would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Finally, there is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. Only China, therefore, appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe in order to foster trade and connectivity in the coming decades.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Despite a series of tax rises this year and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen in 2018, to 1.9% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017. We subsequently expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy, which, alongside a recovering economy, will lead the deficit gradually to contract in the second half of our forecast period, to 1.5% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to have remained broadly stable, at 28% of GDP at end-2018 (from 28.3% at end-2017), despite economic turmoil following the August currency crisis and various government handouts to parts of the population ahead of the June election. The ratio will decline slightly, to 25.3% by the end of 2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
On September 13th the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision represents a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2018. In 2019-20 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that it will miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth has exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest-rate environment in advanced economies, and a diplomatic spat with the US-have contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August, before recovering in September-November. The depreciation of the lira, which gathered pace in August, has caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, and has increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for September (latest available data) suggest that the economy is decelerating sharply in the wake of the currency crisis. After mild growth in the second quarter (5.7% year on year, down from 7.3% in full-year 2017), we expect the economy to contract on a quarterly basis in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, and in January-March 2019. There are substantial downside risks to this forecast; this growth profile does not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
We believe that full-year growth will decelerate to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1%, mainly owing to base effects. In 2020 we expect full-year growth to rebound to 4.9% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average 4%, broadly in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Even before the lira's collapse against the US dollar in August, inflation was already stubbornly high and well above the central bank's official 5% medium-term target; it averaged 11.1% in 2017. This year, however, the currency's depreciation and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to 25.2% year on year in October. This will push inflation to an average of 16.8% this year (from 11.1% in 2017).
In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a broadly stable lira (against the US dollar), an only limited increase in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.6% in 2019, only marginally below the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 9.1%, as global oil prices decline, owing to a slowdown in the US economy, and the exchange rate depreciates only slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In the final years of our forecast period we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of 7.2%-still above the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures). However, an expected pick-up in global oil prices and a depreciation of the lira will maintain upward pressure on prices in 2021-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2017 the lira depreciated by an average of almost 18% against the US dollar. In 2018 we estimate a further average depreciation, of about 25% (in nominal terms) in the full year. The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September to mid-November, we expect the lira to remain broadly stable against the US dollar in the remainder of the year. This expectation is underpinned by our view that the decrease in tensions between the US and Turkey, the sharp reduction in the current-account deficit owing to the depreciation of the lira and the tight monetary policy stance will contribute to a broad stabilisation of the exchange rate in the near term.
In 2019 we forecast that the lira will continue to depreciate on average against the US dollar, albeit at a much more moderate pace than in 2018. A normalising economic and financial domestic situation will support the exchange rate. However, there will be an increase in global risk aversion as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war are fully felt, the cooling of the global economy will cause expectations of a recession in some advanced economies to build and central banks in advanced economies will tighten their monetary policy stances. As a result, we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.7:US$1 in 2019. Risks around our exchange-rate forecast for 2019 are tilted to the upside.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable as the economy starts to grow more markedly after an expected slump in 2018-19. Thereafter in 2021-23 we expect a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.3:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP will narrow in 2018, to 4.6%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar will depress imports and heighten competitiveness. In 2019-23 we expect a smaller average annual current-account deficit, of 3.6%. Significant gains in competitiveness from past lira depreciation, which moderated inflation, and the emergence of spare capacity will result in a boost to exports and imports compression over the medium term.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. [...]we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99% but exchange controls remain.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, have put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed admin-istration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,500% at the end of 2017 and will reach 715,130% by end-2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, making the country the least attractive invest-ment location in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of roll-back of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Despite an extremely severe economic crisis, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. Regardless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, to a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-at some point in the forecast period. Currently, we assume this will happen during 2019. But the process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect the forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
The opposition, owing to internal infighting and years of government harassment, is in disarray and incapable of channelling the populace's dissatisfaction. This notwithstanding, the PSUV is dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen with military or political connections. This network is sustained by opportunities for corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls, subsidised imports, clientelism, control of wasteful state-owned companies and the government's tacit approval of transnational organised crime (as evidenced by numerous press reports, and sanctions and indictments related to drug-trafficking on regime leaders abroad). Regime factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, resulting in different civic-military factions coexisting within the regime. Outside of potential outright criminal income, the resources maintaining this patronage system comes from the export revenue generated by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company.
Mismanagement and underinvestment at PDVSA has led to declining output and exports, destabilising the regime. Purges in the military and re-organisations in civilian government are common as factions jostle for power. In late October Mr Maduro appointed General Manuel Figuera to head SEBIN, the national intelligence agency. He replaced General Gustavo González López, who was a close ally of Diosdado Cabello, head of the Constituent Assembly (ANC, the country's de facto legislature) and Mr Maduro's main internal rival. With resources dwindling, control of the coercive apparatus is key to maintaining regime cohesion. Mr Maduro has thus seemingly increased his capacity to wrangle the regime's competing factions.
However, our baseline view is that the government's proven inability to increase output in PDVSA or secure sufficient financing makes the status-quo unsustainable. This process may be hastened if exports are disrupted by external forces, such as US government sanctions on the oil trade (the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market and a key source of production inputs) or asset seizures stemming from unpaid debts. With oil output nearing 1m barrels/day (b/d), down from 2.5m b/d when Mr Maduro took office, we currently expect an internal fracture in 2019 but, regardless of the timing, what happens next is hard to predict.
Given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would take priority under a new government. We expect regime pragmatists to seek assistance from Western governments and multilateral organisations. To gain international legitimacy and secure the financing, these pragmatists would allow nominal opposition participation in a "mixed administration". Given past behaviour, there should be plenty of opposition figures willing to participate. Even with regime pragmatists, this administration would face pockets of resistance in places like the judiciary, the ANC and the radicalised supporters of the PSUV known as colectivos. As such, political stability through the forecast period will be limited.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. A crucial assumption is that, given economic conditions, Mr Maduro cannot sustain regime cohesion indefinitely. The change at SEBIN introduces risks to this assumption. A second assumption is that Russia and China-erstwhile financiers-will not provide substantial funding to the current administration (or to a PSUV-only successor administration). We base this view on the regime's inability to repay already expired loans and limited aid since 2015. Venezuela's oil wealth, however, remains a draw-especially if sold off at low prices by a bankrupt regime. A significant third assumption is that the need to restore macroeconomic stability and steady resource flows through the patronage system has become so urgent as to allow pragmatists to accept Western-demanded democratic and macroeconomic reforms. The former would likely involve judicial retribution on a number of current regime leaders, while the latter would eliminate the economy's distortions, closing avenues for corruption and enrichment.
As such, there are strong risks to our baseline view and there is a strong possibility of alternate scenarios. These range from: a PSUV-only administration securing enough Chinese financing; a permanently impoverished nation under an outright military government (or one with civilian figureheads); or-as an outside possibility-prolonged chaos if regime cohesion fails but no faction gains clear control of the state apparatus across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Municipal elections are scheduled for December 9th. Most of the opposition has been proscribed and only some parties are participating (which has led to further infighting). In this context, a PSUV sweep is all but guaranteed. Based on our political assumptions, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The US has put individual sanctions on most regime leaders, including potential successors to Mr Maduro. This limits the field of negotiating partners in the event of an internal fracture of the regime, but sanctions are reversible. US country-level sanctions block Venezuela from refinancing its debts. Military intervention and sanctions banning the oil trade not part of our baseline assumption, but the hawkish US foreign policy team increases risks.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing- tens of billions of dollars a year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. The regime openly courts China, but seemingly with apparent little success. A change in the current Chinese stance represents a major risk to our forecast.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The government remains tech-nically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Its latest economic plan, launched in late August, was self-defeating and the government has not complied with a cornerstone promise: to abolish the monetisation of public deficits. As such, monetary imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that underpins our baseline forecast of political change. Furthermore, outside of promising a hard-to-implement reduction in fuel subsidies, the plan had little focus on PDVSA's falling output; production at PDVSA remains crucial factor in supporting the economy amid a collapse in the non-oil sector.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under a new government. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new regime, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These members would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in leadership. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten PDVSA's foreign assets, which facilitate the company's capacity to export oil and import production inputs. PDVSA is complying with a settlement to ConocoPhillips (US), which has consequently halted its attempts at seizing PDVSA's assets in the Caribbean. PDVSA is to pay US$1.5bn over the next 54 months. Similarly, in late October PDVSA made a US$949m payment on a bond that carries 50.1% of Citgo, its US subsidiary, as collateral. Citgo, however, is under threat from Crystallex (Canada), which is already attempting to seize it in lieu of payment of a legal award. (Venezuela has so far stalled via appeals.)
Citgo itself is highly indebted and PDVSA pledged 49.9% as collateral to Rosneft (Russia) as collateral for a US$1.5bn loan in 2016. Citgo's fate could be resolved by a prolonged judicial process. We believe that, if forced to choose, the government would prioritise its Caribbean assets over Citgo, as the former are key for PDVSA's capacity to export, while import-export trade with Citgo could be re-routed to other US companies. However, it is unclear when the government may have to choose. Venezuela has demonstrated its preference for retaining offshore assets, but PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 43% month on month at end-October. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyper-inflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 1m b/d in mid-2019, kept from going lower owing to PDVSA's joint-venture partners. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017, even at the end of our forecast period.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 233% (488,865% year on year) in September. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99% but exchange controls remain. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early November the black-market exchange rate was around BsS240:US$1; the official rate stood at BsS65:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
After an estimated current-account surplus of US$14.2bn in 2018, we expect the current account to remain in surplus for most of the forecast period. These figures are buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2018 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus from 4.8% of GDP in 2020 to a deficit of 1.6% by 2023.
We currently expect that the new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. Mr Tsipras will aim to complete his parliamentary term, ending in October 2019.
The government is vulnerable to further defections, and there is a significant risk of an early election. The centre-right New Democracy (ND) is likely to win the most seats in such an election and to form a government, but it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests over labour market reforms, pension cuts, privatisation, and tax and social security increases are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's creditors.
Mr Tsipras's promises to lower tax, reverse spending cuts and abandon the pension reform agreed before Greece exited the bail-out programme in August could cause tensions with the country's international creditors and investors.
Greece faces its biggest macroeconomic challenge, now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments for almost two years after exiting the bail-out programme. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to a moderate 2% per year on average in 2018-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 170% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove difficult.
We estimate that annual average inflation will ease, from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.8% in 2018, before rising to an annual average of 1.4% in the forecast period (2019-23), reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These factors will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-23.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment and as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency, under new management, gains momentum. Deals start to make progress.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. Capital buffer of about EUR24bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's financing needs
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) painfully slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: Lending hampered by need to increase provisions for still high NPLs. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption of funds persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn (US$31.5bn) and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.4bn, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Following the defection of two members of the AE, in protest at the agreement reached with Macedonia on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute in June, the government's majority has been reduced to just two seats. Mr Tsipras will aim to see through his parliamentary term, which ends in October 2019, but there is a significant risk of a pre-term election.
Tensions within the government coalition persist on a range of issues, including the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. The AE, which has seven seats, has said that it will oppose the name change agreement reached between Macedonia and Greece in June if it is brought before the Greek parliament. In a consultative referendum held on September 30th Macedonians voted overwhelmingly in favour of changing their country's official name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia), but turnout was well below the 50% threshold for the result to be considered valid. The outcome has cast uncertainty over implementation of the agreement, taking some pressure off the Greek government. However, the Syriza-led coalition government remains fragile, as illustrated by the resignation on October 17th of the foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, one of the main architects of the agreement.
On August 20th, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. However, having failed to obtain significant debt relief to ease future austerity, Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election. He hopes that economic growth will gain momentum over the coming year and allow him to implement promises to lower taxes and increase spending. He also hopes that Greece's international creditors will approve his government's proposal to cancel agreed pension cuts in 2019 on the grounds that they will not be needed in order to achieve the country's fiscal targets (a 3.5% primary surplus). The Economist Intelligence Unit remains sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expects that rolling back on reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could trigger tensions in the country's financial market.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has been more than 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
In mid-June 2018 Greece and Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia) reached an agreement to change Macedonia's constitutional name to Northern Macedonia to end Greece's opposition to that country's accession to NATO. However, there is strong public opposition to the agreement in both countries, and Greece's coalition government is divided on the issue. The low turnout at the referendum in Macedonia on September 30th has complicated implementation. For this, the proposed changes need to be incorporated into Macedonia's constitution with a two-thirds majority in the country's parliament by end-January 2019 and ratified in the Greek parliament next year.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have risen recently. The risk of military hostility is high, particularly in the Aegean Sea, but both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in mid-August of two Greek soldiers arrested for alleged espionage in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions, which were threatening to boil over.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Despite exiting the third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line, the government will be subject to huge policy constraints during the next five years and beyond. General government debt is huge, officially projected to reach EUR335bn by end-2018, or almost 185% of GDP, according to our GDP estimates. It is also now almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), so another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, is unlikely.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup, Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released on August 6th. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR24.1bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn) and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprise the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn.
Greece, in response, has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after its exit from the bail-out programme in August, it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term, through to early 2020. However, in the medium and long term the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk; however, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will represent risk in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In 2017 the budget surplus was equivalent to 0.8% of GDP and the primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) exceeded the bail-out programme target of 1.75%, coming in at 4%. We estimate a minimal budget deficit in 2018, of 0.2% of GDP, and expect Greece to fall just short of its annual primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP this year and in 2019-22. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP in 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve, owing to the fact that debt repayments become much more onerous from that year on. We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually during this period, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR317.4bn, or 179.1% of GDP, in 2017. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain above 170% in 2018-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. It will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter, government consumption by almost a quarter, household consumption by a fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. We forecast that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to an average of 2% per year in 2018-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism performance, if capacity constraints are addressed. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Seasonally and calendar-day-adjusted real GDP growth slowed from 0.9% quarter on quarter in January-March (2.5% year on year) to 0.2% (1.8% year on year) in April-June, despite steady expansion of domestic consumption and a strong export of services (largely driven by tourism). We estimate that real GDP growth will reach 2% in 2018. This remains a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by 7.9% year on year in the first half of 2018. We expect a pick-up in the second half of the year to reduce the contraction to 1% in 2018 as whole, followed by average annual of growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still about 50% below its 2007 peak. Underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about the country's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.8% in 2019-23.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs over the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We believe that there is a significant risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
After averaging 1.1% in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate (seasonally adjusted, EU harmonised) dipped sharply at the start of 2018, before accelerating moderately since May. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack remains in the labour market, and domestic demand is subdued. Despite rising global commodity prices and increased tourism, we estimate that annual inflation will average 0.8% in 2018 (it averaged 0.6% in the first nine months of the year). We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.4% per year on average in 2019-23 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July before weakening to US$1.13:EUR1 in mid-August. The euro has since recovered to US$1.16-1.17:EUR1 in September-October, but will remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US. We expect it to begin firming against the dollar from 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2018-19 and US$1.21:EUR1 in 2020-21. The euro will also receive structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to an average ofUS$1.24:EUR1 in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports due to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 0.8% of GDP in 2017, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We expect widening deficits in 2018-23 as import prices rise and import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, but these will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: [...]uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. [...]exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19-especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. Palm oil prices are forecast to follow a similar trend as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Cocoa (US cents/lb) 138.9 142.2 131.1 92.1 104.5 97.3 100.6 92.0 94.0 96.0 Coffee (Arabica) (US cents/lb) 200.7 159.9 163.8 150.7 130.9 139.3 155.8 170.0 175.0 172.0 Coffee (Robusta) (US cents/lb) 100.5 88.1 88.6 100.9 85.1 90.0 102.8 100.0 103.5 101.5 Tea (US$/kg) 2.72 2.79 2.70 3.15 2.96 2.81 2.90 2.85 2.92 2.95 Sugar (US cents/lb) 17.0 13.4 18.1 16.0 11.7 10.3 11.3 11.4 11.4 11.3 Barley (US$/tonne) 146.1 127.9 129.4 138.5 161.7 164.6 169.5 153.9 161.8 163.8 Maize (US$/tonne) 206.0 175.5 168.3 160.9 176.0 182.5 192.5 188.0 192.0 195.0 Rice (US$/tonne) 423.8 386.0 386.0 389.8 404.0 407.5 411.3 430.0 427.0 428.0 Sorghum (US$/tonne) 909.3 682.6 734.2 786.1 917.5 933.9 961.7 873.5 918.1 929.2 Wheat (US$/tonne) 302.7 232.5 197.5 211.5 246.9 251.3 258.8 235.0 247.0 250.0 Soybeans (US$/tonne) 501.3 379.8 389.8 377.0 365.3 346.3 346.3 388.0 402.0 410.0 Soybean oil (US$/tonne) 909.3 682.6 734.2 757.6 708.8 671.9 671.9 752.9 752.9 752.9 Soymeal (US$/tonne) 527.9 398.7 380.6 358.8 382.2 372.8 362.3 406.0 406.0 406.0 Palm oil (US$/tonne) 821.4 559.4 639.1 649.1 606.4 557.0 559.9 587.0 580.0 582.0 Rapeseed oil (US$/tonne) 907.3 775.3 823.6 869.5 836.5 906.3 915.0 960.0 970.0 975.0 Sunflowerseed oil (US$/tonne) 901.8 845.8 840.9 795.7 766.8 758.6 845.1 875.0 903.0 913.0 Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Note. WCF (World commodity forecasts) is an index of 22 hard and soft commodities. FFB (Food, feedstuffs and beverages) is a price index of 13 soft commodities. The beverages sector has a weight of 20% in the FFB index, grains 46.4%, oilseeds 28.6% and sugar 4.9%. The FFB index has a weight of 55.6% in the WCF index.
Agricultural prices will show a faster than expected recovery in 2018
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that its food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index rose by 2.8% in 2018, halting a seven-year decline. Nonetheless, this is a downward revision (from 4.4% previously), primarily owing to weaker prices for beverages such as coffee and cocoa, as well as sugar. The bilateral trade war between the US and China has disrupted existing trade patterns and caused the prices of some products that are subject to tariffs, including soybeans and soymeal, to diverge in various markets. A number of other markets, including grains such as rice and maize, are also beginning to tighten slightly, which will support sustained price growth through to 2020. Nonetheless, supplies in most markets remain comfortable by historical standards; several crops registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. Downside risks related to a potentially disruptive El Niño event will persist, but we do not forecast an agricultural price shock. FFB prices are forecast to remain flat in 2019 as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war start to impact markets. However, by 2020 we expect producers and consumers to have adapted to shifting supply chains, supporting 4.1% growth in the FFB index, owing to strong price growth in beverages, sugar and grains. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) in the FFB sector in the medium and long term.
FFB prices will rise again in 2020, and risks to the forecast remain mixed
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw on. We expect global GDP growth to remain relatively firm, at an average of 2.6% per year in 2019-20. However, uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19-especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. This will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further contributing to global supplies.
Grain prices registered strong gains in 2018
We estimate that grain prices will rise by 14.1% in 2018. Maize prices rose by about 10% on average in February in response to worries about drought and rapidly shrinking production prospects in Argentina. However, as other crops come to the market and carryover supplies from the bumper 2016/17 crop remain available, we estimate full-year maize price growth to average 9.4% in 2018. For wheat, adverse weather conditions are affecting yields across the world, changing the supply outlook significantly. As global demand growth remains strong, we expect the market to register a deficit in 2017/18. Overall, we estimate wheat prices to surge ahead by around 17% year on year in 2018 (from 18% previously) and by a further 2% in 2019 (from 3% previously).
Oilseed prices will fall in 2019-20
Oilseed prices are estimated to fall by 2% in 2018 after a similar decline in 2017, largely owing to the bumper soybean crop in major producers such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stockpiles higher. We expect soybean prices to decline by an average of 1.7% per year in 2019-20. China's imposition in July of a 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US has created the potential for greater price volatility; for now, however, we expect China to source imports from other suppliers, avoiding a sharp increase in prices. Sunflowerseed oil prices are likely to weaken in 2019, reflecting comfortable supplies. Palm oil prices are forecast to follow a similar trend as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We estimate that the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee, cocoa and tea, will fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We expect cocoa prices to rise by 13.4% in 2018, before declining by around 7% in 2019; however, this will do little to erase the massive drop in 2017 of nearly 30%, which was caused by soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices (arabica) are forecast to fall by 13% in 2018 on the back of higher than expected production from Central America as well as the comparative strength of the US dollar, which will encourage exporters to sell their stocks. In 2019 we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to rebound by 6.4%, as several consecutive years of market deficits begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2019
Sugar prices are estimated to decline by around 27% in 2018, following a decline of 11.6% in 2017. This reflects crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets, which are fuelling expectations of a larger global sugar surplus than we had previously anticipated. Policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably China, India and the EU) have weakened market sentiment further. This decline will continue in 2019, but we expect supplies to begin to tighten in 2020 as higher ethanol prices encourage farmers to divert more cane to ethanol (rather than to its rival, sugar). This should support growth in global sugar prices of nearly 10% year on year in 2020.

Cocoa
Demand
After decelerating from 2.4% in the 2016/17 season (October-September) to an estimated 1.5% in 2017/18, global cocoa consumption growth is forecast to slow further during 2018/19-2019/20. Although cocoa consumption in the world's largest consumers-mainly developed economies, as well as some large markets in the developing world-is forecast to remain positive, consumption growth will remain weak in many of these countries, at less than 1%. By contrast, cocoa consumption growth will prove stronger in other, smaller cocoa consumers, but these markets will not be sufficiently large to drive stronger overall growth in global cocoa consumption. By region, Asia accounts for much of the increase in global demand, although rising demand in the Americas and Europe will also contribute. The Economist Intelligence Unit is forecasting global cocoa consumption growth to average 1.3% per year in 2018/19 and 2019/20. High per-capita consumption levels in major developed markets will prevent faster demand growth. Another factor precluding more rapid growth in global cocoa demand includes retail prices, which may rise in response to the increase in global cocoa prices in recent months, potentially pushing some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. Meanwhile, the size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity but also to protect profits against a background of rising cocoa prices in previous years-which will also hamper consumption growth.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in developed economies. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounted for 27% of the world's imports of cocoa powder in 2016/17, compared with just 11% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to lift demand for powder.
Consumption growth will remain fairly low in more saturated markets
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2018/19-2019/20. Health concerns, market saturation and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping is eroding spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases). However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption. Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for 18% of global demand) and in European countries, which collectively account for 46% of global demand, are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate with a higher cocoa content, but with less frequent purchases. However, somewhat weaker underlying economic conditions will contribute to a gradual deceleration in cocoa consumption in many of these markets over the course of2018/19-2019/20.
Cocoa consumption growth will remain firm in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels of just 35 g in India and 62 g in China in 2016/17, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets. However, demand growth will be constrained by high retail prices. Chinese demand will continue to rise firmly, at a rate of around 5.1% per year in 2018/19-2019/20 on the back of a relatively firm GDP growth forecast. In India, we expect demand growth to pick up from an estimated 2.1% in 2017/18 to an annual average of 3.1% per year during the forecast period.

Supply
After falling by an estimated 3.5% in 2017/18, prospects for global cocoa production are weak for the 2018/19-2019/20 forecast period, reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively the world's largest and second-largest cocoa producers. Although output in both countries will remain high by historical standards, lower farm-gate prices and weaker confidence among growers will drag down cocoa output. Notwithstanding a rise in prices in 2018, the previous long-running period of weak prices is likely to have dissuaded farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticides, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production. Rising production in other Asian and Latin America producers will fail to offset the decline in cocoa output among several of the largest African producers.
Structural and geographical factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farm-gate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa, but farmers are also getting a much smaller share of the final retail price than in previous decades owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. In West Africa, for example, many farmers remain below the poverty line, and as a result few young people are choosing to work in the cocoa sector. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to attract new workers, but it is uncertain how effective this will be in the long term.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can only be grown in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) under warm and humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Periodically, there is speculation that climate change will hamper production in these countries to such an extent that cocoa production will plummet. However, we believe that some countries have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of grinding facilities in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production is set to drop in 2018/19 and 2019/20
In Côte d'Ivoire, we estimate that cocoa output fell by 3.5% in 2017/18, partly as a result of dry weather, which affected the mid-year-crop. We are forecasting production to fall again in 2018/19, by 5.1%, reflecting a relatively unsupportive domestic policy backdrop. Not only has the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC), issued fewer export licences, but plans to accelerate the replacement of old crops infected by swollen shoot virus (which cuts yields) with new crops over the course of the next three years will hamper production. In addition, the CCC has kept farm-gate prices on hold, which has discouraged the use of fertiliser and pesticides, with the incidence of crop disease rising as a result. Even if farm-gate prices were raised-which is unlikely now that global cocoa prices are falling-it is doubtful whether this would come soon enough to impact output trends for the 2018/19 harvest. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from price volatility, but the amounts have been insufficient, and given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC, neither farmers nor exporters are confident that losses arising from low global prices in 2016/17 will be recouped. Given that we do not expect a significant improvement in any of these factors in the short term, we expect cocoa production to slip again in 2019/20, although by a milder 1.4%.
Ghanaian production is set to decline in both 2018/19 and 2019/20
Similar production trends are evident in Ghana. Adverse weather and a difficult policy backdrop hampered production in 2017/18, with cocoa output declining by an estimated 12.4%. We are forecasting a continued, albeit gentler, contraction in 2018/19 and 2019/20. The cocoa authority, Cocobod, is encountering financial problems that are likely to affect the amount paid to farmers, which will in turn depress output. Cocobod was forced to seek a bridging loan from the Bank of Ghana (the central bank) last year, and following the recent depletion of its stabilisation fund and indications that it may take on more debt this year, Cocobod has announced that it is considering amending the way in which farmers are paid. This is likely to involve the removal of a scheme that pays subsidies to farmers (guaranteeing a minimum income level). The authorities are instead considering a scheme in which farmers are paid 70% of the cocoa export price, which would expose incomes to considerable market volatility. Given anxiety among farmers about the government's intention to prioritise other crops over cocoa, the ongoing encroachment by gold miners, the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser and the fact that around one-fifth of trees are affected by swollen shoot disease, production is forecast to fall by 2.9% in 2018/19 and by 3% in 2019/20.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally 3-5 years). The authorities aim ultimately to raise production significantly, with Cocobod recently indicating that it is targeting output of 1m tonnes within the next five years (an apparent downgrade from previous statements citing a target of 1.5m tonnes within four years), driven by better soil management, pest and disease control and improved irrigation. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (estimated at 40% by Cocobod) and consequently a low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). However, it will be difficult to secure the necessary funding. We think it is unlikely that these ambitious plans will come to fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment and external creditors are unlikely to fund the project.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
Cameroon's cocoa production is estimated to have moderated in 2017/18 by 8.5% as political unrest in the south-west of the country, which produces around half of the country's output, dragged down national production, with rising numbers of farmers fleeing their plantations in the wake of violent clashes between separatists and the security forces. Although we are forecasting a slight recovery in cocoa output, by 1.8% on average per year in 2018/19 and 2019/20, production levels will remain weak. Cuts in farm-gate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". Plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year are highly unlikely to materialise in the context of the recent political instability.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has recovered in recent years after a slump in 2014-16, rising by an estimated 4.1% in 2017/18 to 255,000 tonnes (still below the government target of 300,000-320,000 tonnes). The authorities are seeking investment to raise cocoa production with the aim of diversifying and expanding sources of foreign-exchange earnings beyond the mainstay of oil, with the Ministry of Agriculture recently stating that it believes Nigeria can boost cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. However, we remain pessimistic about production prospects and are forecasting a contraction of 1.6% on average per year in 2018/19-2019/20. Government initiatives meant to support farmers-including efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and to increase the distribution of free seedlings-have not been successful. In addition, investment has been slow to materialise, and reports of the dieback fungal disease in the south-west of the country-affecting trees that account for 10% of national output-will hamper production in the near term. Structural problems such as weak infrastructure, corruption, poor and expensive access to financing along with weak implementation remain unaddressed and will prevent a significant increase in output.
Production will continue to recover in Indonesia
Indonesia is one of the few major cocoa producers that are likely to see output rising firmly during the forecast period. Stable weather conditions in 2017/18 are likely to have lifted cocoa output by an estimated 7.4%. We forecast continued growth of 5.1% during the forecast period, but at 320,000 tonnes in 2019/20 output levels will remain weak by historical standards. The authorities have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these targets are highly unlikely to materialise. Indonesian firms will probably rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from nearby Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America
Structurally, there is scope for both of Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, to lift output as manufacturers look to develop production centres outside West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. Although some of this investment will be slow to materialise, we still expect annual average output growth of 3.5% in Ecuador and 4.9% in Brazil during 2018/19-2019/20.

We expect the surplus in the global cocoa market to narrow sharply, from an estimated 382,000 tonnes in 2017/18 to 132,000 tonnes in 2019/20. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that we continue to forecast a market surplus, despite signs of continued (albeit weaker) demand growth. Stocks are forecast to reach close to 2.5m tonnes at the end of the 2019/20 season. Although this is high by historical standards, the relatively gloomy production outlook is likely to bolster prices towards the end of the forecast period.

Market surplus will put downward pressure on prices in 2019
Cocoa prices traded at comparatively low levels between February 2017 and February 2018, mainly in the range of US$1,950/tonne and US$2,050/tonne. However, prices rose sharply in March-May, to US$2,600-2,700/tonne, on the back of gloomy prospects for production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Better weather conditions subsequently led to a reduction in prices to an average of around US$2,170/tonne in August.
In spite of our estimates for a gradual moderation in prices over the remainder of 2018, we expect average quarterly prices to remain above US$2,200/tonne. Our full-year average price forecast, at US$2,304/tonne, implies a 13.6% year on year increase. Despite falling production in 2019, weaker demand and a persistent market surplus will suppress prices, which are forecast to average US$2,145/tonne, marking a decline of 6.9% year on year. Although the same factors will remain in play in 2020, with declining production and weaker demand growth, investor concerns about the impact of several years of falling output will place some support under prices, which we expect will pick up to around US$2,300/tonne by the last quarter of 2020.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption has been accelerating moderately in recent years, to an estimated 3.5% in the 2017/18 crop year (October-September), largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries-mainly developed economies-which account for two-thirds of global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth in global coffee demand to decelerate to 2.6% in 2018/19 and 1.9% in 2019/20, mainly reflecting less supportive underlying economic conditions. Continued monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers will affect overall domestic demand, although with the policy stance remaining fairly loose and most economies decelerating rather than entering into a recession, coffee consumption will rise more steadily. In coffee-exporting countries, many of which are emerging markets, consumption growth will be lower, averaging 2.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20. Tepid demand growth in Brazil, which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption owing to the sheer size of its domestic market, is the main factor contributing to weak overall growth in coffee consumption among coffee exporters. Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China, whose economy will continue to grow firmly. However, per-capita coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global growth (China will account for only 3% of the total global rise in coffee production in 2017/18-2018/19).
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America (with 46% of coffee in the US now consumed out of the home) and Europe (which saw the number of coffee shops rise by 6.4% in 2017), but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets, as well as the spread of coffee delivery services by large chains. In some markets-including the US and China-large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by the heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although accounting for only a small share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee-pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that in volume terms the instant- and ground-coffee market remains larger. Despite the sharp slowdown in sales of machines and capsules after initial firm growth, the coffee-pod market will continue to provide important support for overall demand of arabica coffee (most pods contain predominantly arabica beans).
Coffee consumption growth in North America will continue to rise
We expect US coffee consumption to continue to grow at a more moderate pace than in recent years. From an estimated 4.8% in 2017/18, coffee consumption growth is forecast to decelerate to 4.1% in 2018/19 and 1.8% in 2019/20, reflecting a gradual slowing of underlying consumer demand growth. That said, coffee consumption is not expected to fall, with the US National Coffee Association estimating that the percentage of people drinking coffee is continuing to rise (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017, according to the latest data). Daily consumption is rising, and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products; for example, US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over 2015-17. Moreover, the number of coffee shops is increasing at a rate of around 3.6% per year, while the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee has gone up from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017. Demand growth among 18-24-year-olds is also rising strongly, which bodes well for medium- to long-term coffee consumption trends.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers, in particular, are showing a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations. We expect Canada's demand growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to slow moderately to an average of 2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20.
Coffee consumption in Brazil will moderate
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. As Brazil emerges from a sharp economic recession that caused coffee consumption to remain fairly flat in 2014-16, coffee consumption is showing signs of strengthening and is estimated to rise by 3.6% in 2017/18. This is likely to moderate but remain fairly firm at around 2.3% per year in 2018/19 and 2019/20, although the local coffee processing association, the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC), is projecting firmer coffee consumption growth in 2018 as the economy recovers. However, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment and rising fuel prices, which will all act as a drag on disposable income.
Continued coffee consumption growth is forecast in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia, with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by an estimated 0.9% in 2017/18, we expect coffee consumption to growth to rise by an average of 1.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20. This growth will be driven by coffee sales in convenience stores, given that the number of coffee shops is falling. Meanwhile, in South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with imports more than trebling in the past decade and the number of coffee shops increasing even faster. We expect the pace of growth to slow but remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 2.6% per year over the forecast period.
China consumption and production data
Until recently we have not included China in our list of top coffee consumers and producers, instead including it in our list of "others". This reflects the fact that the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) does not report China's coffee consumption and production, complicating direct data comparisons with other consuming and producing countries. Widespread acknowledgment of China emerging as a major player in the coffee market has prompted us to amend our tables to include figures for China. However, a lack of historical data series means that these figures should be regarded as estimates.
Consumption
We have based the historical series of our coffee consumption data on a paper written by the ICO, in which it estimates consumption based on production, export and import figures. It provides data to 2013/14, with annual consumption calculated from domestic production plus net exports. From 2013/14 onwards we have estimated coffee consumption based on growth in private consumption to provide a rough guide to the size of the Chinese coffee market. According to these calculations, China is the sixth-largest coffee consumer among coffee-exporting countries, but at 2.4m bags in 2016/17 its market is significantly smaller than those of many coffee-importing countries. By comparison, Chinese coffee consumption remains lower than consumption in the UK, despite huge disparities in population size.
Production
We have used data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which are current until 2016/17. This series indicates that coffee production rose sharply between 2008/09 and 2013/14, more than trebling, but output has since stabilised at around 1.9m bags. This makes China the world's tenth-largest coffee producer.

Demand in China and India will continue to grow
Coffee demand in China and India, which have similar levels of consumption, will continue to grow, aided by still-firm economic growth in both countries, which will lift disposable incomes. Although GDP growth is likely to be stronger in India, we expect coffee consumption growth in China to be firmer. This reflects the fact that the middle class has expanded much more rapidly in China than in India, where disposable income levels for the most part remain extremely low. The emergence of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres is a key factor contributing to the rise in coffee consumption in China, aided by a rapid expansion of international coffee chains. Starbucks now runs 3,200 outlets in 139 Chinese cities, up from 2,300 in October 2017. Of these, around 600 are in Shanghai alone-Starbucks' largest presence in a single city. A new store which opened in the city last December, the Shanghai Reserve Roastery, is the company's highest-earning branch worldwide. Despite signs of weaker sales growth in China amid greater competition from fast-growing start-ups offering coffee delivery, the company is still planning to have 6,000 stores open by the end of 2022. With the out-of-home sector expanding slightly less rapidly in India, coffee consumption will grow more slowly. We therefore forecast average growth of 2.1% per year in 2018/19-2019/20, compared with an estimated 2.2% growth in 2017/18.
South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in some countries, mainly in coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia and opened its first store in Vietnam last October.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee-which generally use the robusta variety-in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.
Supply
The biennial crop season in Brazil, the world's largest producer, will continue to have a significant impact on overall global coffee output trends. Global output fell by 0.3% in the 2017/18 crop year, which mainly reflected a drop in output in Brazil as the crop year switched to a lower-producing (off-season) year. However, we expect global coffee production to rebound by a firm 6.5% in 2018/19. A recovery in Brazil's production as the crop switches back to a higher-producing year will account for over 80% of the global increase in coffee output. Rising production in several other Latin American coffee producers as well as Asian growers will have a marginal but positive impact on coffee output. We are forecasting a 1.8% drop in global coffee production in 2019/20, with Brazil switching to another off-season year. We are currently forecasting only mild production increases elsewhere, which will fail to compensate for the decline in Brazil. This is based on the assumption that recent low coffee prices will hamper output in the medium term as cutbacks on pesticide and fertiliser usage affect production levels.
Coffee production is Brazil is estimated to reach record levels in 2018/19
In Brazil, notwithstanding the shift from an on-season crop in 2018/19 to an off-season crop in 2019/20, production in both years is forecast to be high by historical standards. Although some arabica-producing areas reported dryness earlier in 2018-delaying harvest progress-recent weather conditions have been much better, which will bolster prospects for 2018/19. Local observers have stated that there is potential for a bumper crop, with some even suggesting that output of up to 65m bags is possible, which would be a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). We believe that this figure is out of reach and are forecasting coffee production of 59.5m bags for the 2018/19 season. This is above the forecast of 58m bags from Conab, Brazil's food statistics agency, and the 57.1m bags projected by the government statistics agency, but below the forecast of 60.2m bags from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The strong result is likely to reflect a firm recovery in both arabica and robusta production (which are expected to account for three-quarters and one-quarter of total output respectively). Our expectation that coffee production will fall to a still-strong 54m bags in 2019/20 is based on the belief that the continued weakness of the local currency will continue to provide an incentive to growers.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to stabilise at historically high levels
In Vietnam, supportive weather conditions led to a sharp 15.5% increase in the 2017/18 crop, with coffee production coming in at 29.5m bags. We expect a slight decline in coffee production in 2018/19 and 2019/20, although at around 29m bags output levels will remain high compared with recent years. These forecasts are more optimistic than the authorities' projections for medium-term coffee production, which tend to be fairly low. However, recent weather conditions have been relatively supportive, while government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop will support still-firm output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically higher. Firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will also encourage growers. We expect coffee output to decline by 0.8% per year in 2018/19-2019/20.
Output growth is Mexico and Central America will flatten
Coffee production also stood at historically high levels in Mexico and Central America in 2017/18, growing by 7.6% to close to 21m bags (surpassing the 20m-mark for the first time on record). After several outbreaks of disease in recent years greater use of fungicides and fertiliser boosted coffee production, with weather conditions also proving supportive. We expect coffee production in the sub-region to stabilise at around current levels in 2018/19 and 2019/20. We expect some countries to register slightly weaker production levels, in particular the sub-region's largest producer, Honduras, where output will moderate after an exceptionally strong 2017/18. Guatemala will also register a decline owing to the effects of a volcanic eruption in the south-west of the country in June, which is believed to have wiped out 1% of the country's coffee plantations. However, this will be offset by moderate rises in coffee production elsewhere in the sub-region, including Mexico and Nicaragua, which will benefit from ongoing programmes to rejuvenate ageing coffee plantations.
Colombian production is set to recover after a weather-induced fall in 2017/18
After five years of rising coffee production in Colombia output fell by 4.3% in 2017/18 to 14m bags as cloudy weather conditions affected flowering on coffee bushes early in the season, which was followed by very wet weather. However, the sector's fundamentals are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes, and as such we do not expect the decline to persist. Recent additional planting in existing plantations has focused on improving yields, which at 18 bags/ha in 2016 were much lower than in other large growers (27 bags/ha in Brazil and 35 bags/ha in Vietnam). As a result we expect production to recover in 2018/19 and 2019/20, with output growing by 5% and 2% respectively. Towards the end of the forecast period the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the then FARC rebels will allow coffee cultivation to expand in previously isolated areas of the country (although we view the government's statements that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as overly optimistic).
Coffee production is likely to recover but remain fairly weak in Indonesia
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector, which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil, have been completely derailed. The El Niño weather phenomenon brought excessively dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the harvests in both 2016/17 and 2017/18. Even assuming a 5.5% increase in 2018/19 and a 2.6% rise in 2019/20, at just 11.8m bags output will remain low by historical standards. Low average yields-at only around one-fifth of the levels recorded in Vietnam-reflect high levels of structural inefficiency in the sector, which we do not expect to be tackled during the forecast period.

a Crop years April-March.
Production prospects in Africa, which accounts for around 11% of total global coffee output, are relatively bright. Many of the continent's coffee producers have very low levels of output; together, Ethiopia and Uganda account for 70% of African coffee output. Production rose firmly in both countries in 2017/18, mainly on the back of better weather conditions. We expect output to continue to rise in 2018/19 and 2019/20, reflecting an extensive reseeding programme in recent years, an expansion of the coffee-growing area and domestic efforts to streamline the organisation of the sector.
Stocks and prices
After falling marginally in 2017/18, we expect global coffee stocks to rise in 2018/19 on the back of a sharp rise in production, coupled with continued sales of stocks by exporting countries, with producers taking advantage of weak local currencies against the US dollar to boost locally denominated profits. However, with coffee production falling and consumption continuing to rise (albeit more mildly) in 2019/20, the market balance is expected to tip into deficit. By end-2019/20 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 30.3m bags, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

Coffee prices are increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar
Arabica prices have fallen more or less steadily since the beginning of 2017, standing at an average of US$1.25/lb in August 2018 (compared with close to US$1.70/lb in January 2017). Futures prices are trading even lower, with arabica for December delivery falling below the US$1/lb mark in early September (a 12-year low). Given that the global market is estimated to have registered a slight deficit in 2017/18, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often caused by a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In recent months speculation about bumper production levels in Brazil in 2018/19 has pushed prices lower. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
Aside from positive signs from Brazilian producers, continued high levels of coffee output from other main producers are likely to keep prices suppressed in the near term. We expect prices to fall further in the fourth quarter of 2018, with an estimated average price of US$1.31/lb for the full year representing a 12.9% year on year decline for arabica. Given that the next off-season in Brazil (2019/20) is likely to hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery in prices to an average of US$1.39/lb in 2019, before a continued rise to US$1.56/lb in 2020 as the global market balance slips into deficit.
Prices for cheaper robusta will also decline during much of 2018 as bean supply picks up. We expect prices to average 85 US cents/lb in 2018-a 15.7% year-on-year decline-before rising to 90 US cents/lb in 2019 and US$1.03/lb in 2020.

Maize
Demand
World demand for maize has increased at an astonishing pace during the past two decades, rising from just 600m tonnes at the turn of the millennium to a projected 1.09bn tonnes in 2018/19, up by 2.9% compared with the previous year. Provisional demand projections for 2019/20 are for further, albeit more modest growth of 1.7%, to 1.1bn tonnes. Apart from 2012/13, when US crops were badly affected by drought, consumption has increased each season, with growth averaging 3.1% per year over 2012/13-2016/17. While stocks mostly tightened through to 2006/07, the spike in demand has lately been more than offset by an even steeper rise in production, resulting in a build-up of supplies. Maize is primarily used as a feed ingredient, which accounts for around 55% of total usage.
Amid broad-based gains in world meat production, especially of poultry and pork, demand for high-starch, high-energy feed maize continues to trend higher almost everywhere, with growth averaging around 2% per year. Booming demand for biofuels, and to a lesser extent other sugars and starches, has boosted the use for industrial processing at an even faster rate. Led by gains in the US and China, world industrial use has surged from around 75m tonnes 20 years ago to a projected 305m tonnes in the 2018/19 marketing year. Helped by a series of large crops in Sub-Saharan Africa, food maize demand has also seen relatively firm growth in recent seasons and is forecast to reach 123m tonnes in 2018/19.
World feed demand will rise by 3% in 2018/19
Growth in global demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient in animal feed, which can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. We expect 3% annual growth in the use of maize for livestock feed in 2018/19, broadly in line with the previous year, with overall demand touching a new record of 621m tonnes. The EU and China are likely to account for much of the increase, with notable gains also expected in Russia, Brazil, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.
The EU is a huge consumer of maize for livestock feed, with use seen averaging 57m tonnes/year (t/y) in recent seasons. Compound feed manufacturers across the bloc consume near-equal amounts of maize, barley and wheat in most years, with price and availability determining how much of each is used in a particular year. The 2018/19 season will in large part be shaped by the drought that has occurred across much of northern Europe. As a result, wheat availabilities are much tighter than normal, while pastures are bare in many countries, raising the need for additional feed grain supplies. Based on current price spreads, maize is best-placed to meet the shortfall. Feed consumption is seen climbing to a new record high of 62.5m tonnes, up by 7% from 2017/18. With question-marks over the size of local maize crops, the additional supplies will come from a 25% rise in imports, seen climbing to 21.5m tonnes in 2017/18 (July-June). At that level, the EU would by some distance be the world's biggest importer of maize, surpassing the imports of second-placed Mexico by some 5m tonnes. The majority of this is likely to be sourced from Ukraine and Brazil, although additional purchases from Serbia and Canada are possible. Following the mid-June implementation of a 25% tariff on US maize imports by the EU, supplies from that country are not expected to be competitive.
African swine fever could affect demand for feed in China
African swine fever, a highly contagious viral disease for which there is no vaccine, has recently been detected for the first time in China and is now spreading rapidly. The virus is transmitted by ticks or direct contact between animals, as well as by contaminated animal feed or meat products, where it can survive for months. The virus is not harmful to humans but is often lethal for domestic pigs and wild boars. Infections have also been reported this year in parts of the EU, as well as in Russia and Ukraine. However, with half of the world's pig population located in China, this latest outbreak is by far the most alarming. The local authorities have moved quickly to contain the infection, culling thousands of pigs, banning the transport of live animals and closing markets in affected areas. At this early stage of the outbreak the potential impact on animal feed demand remains unclear. In the short term, any sharp reductions in slaughter rates might actually strengthen spot feed demand, while in the longer term much will depend on the severity of the outbreak and how many animals are affected. At an emergency regional meeting called by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in early September, officials cautioned that the infection would likely spread to other parts of Asia.
World industrial demand set to rise again in 2018/19
Industrial processors are projected to use 305m tonnes of maize in 2018/19, up by 3% year on year to another record high. Robust global GDP growth continues to drive demand for maize-based industrial goods, including starch, while use for ethanol fuel is also increasing in the US and Brazil. There is potential for a steep rise in maize-based biofuel production in China, where the authorities have announced plans for an ambitious nationwide ethanol blending programme, similar to the one that led to the recent boom in the US.

A partial breakthrough in NAFTA negotiations
US maize farmers and exporters were relieved by the announcement in late August of a preliminary trade agreement between the US and Mexico. Negotiators concluded a deal to change parts of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), while at the same time maintaining duty-free access for agricultural products. NAFTA negotiations with Canada are ongoing and will remain crucial for the completion of the renegotiation process.
Supply
Global maize production has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past two decades, rising from less than 600m tonnes in 1999/2000 to more than 1bn tonnes since 2016/17. During this period production has declined on just five occasions, typically as a result of spells of difficult cropping weather. In general, production has been driven steadily upward by increases in both areas and yields. Amid strengthening demand for animal feed and industrial products, high market prices have encouraged additional plantings almost everywhere. New seed varieties, fertiliser and better farming practices have also been used with great effect to push up average yields, which are now approaching 6 tonnes/ha, compared with 4.4 tonnes/ha in the late 1990s.
The 2018/19 the world supply outlook for maize currently appears fairly comfortable, especially when compared with wheat, production of which is expected to decline by around 6% year on year. An expected shift in feed demand away from wheat to maize places extra importance on the outcome of this year's maize harvest in the US-the world's largest producer and exporter. Yields currently appear encouraging, implying that the US should be able to meet any predicted uptick in demand. South America remains a major area of uncertainty, as 2018/19 crops are not yet in the ground. Based on increases in September for the US and Ukraine, our 2018/19 global crop estimate is raised by 6m tonnes to 1,056m tonnes, potentially the second-largest crop on record. The outlook for 2019/20 remains highly provisional at this stage. However, assuming a rise in US sowings and potentially bigger crops in South America, global output could tick higher, to around 1,062m tonnes, marking a rise of 0.5% year on year.
US output is seen unchanged in 2018/19
July and August are the critical months for US crops such as maize and soybeans. Summer weather this year has been broadly favourable across large swathes of the US Corn Belt, with mostly seasonable temperatures interspersed with regular rainfall, especially in Illinois and Iowa, the two core producing states. Crops have developed rapidly in many areas, while crop tours conducted over the past month or so have mostly confirmed excellent yield potential. Indeed, the survey-based analysis from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests that record yields-possibly as high as 11.2 tonnes/ha-should be in prospect. In conjunction with advanced farming techniques and ever more sophisticated technology, the latest hybrid seeds have performed extremely well in recent years. With excellent productivity seen offsetting this season's drop in area, 2018/19 production is forecast to be almost unchanged compared with the year before, at 370.5m tonnes.
Smaller area and lower yields are expected in Brazil
While the global focus has already shifted to the 2018/19 crop outlook, Brazil's 2017/18 season is still far from over. With harvesting still not finished, our total production estimate is held unchanged at 82m tonnes, down by 16.2% from the previous year. Following a spike in internal transport costs and a drop in the value of the Brazilian Real, the cost of farm inputs, including fertiliser, has risen sharply in recent months, boosting production costs in the run-up to planting of the 2018/19 maize and soybean crops. Continued disagreements about internal trucking costs have also slowed physical deliveries of fertiliser from the southern ports to the main producing areas. Very strong competition for soybeans is again expected to impact planting of the full-season (first) crop, predominantly grown in traditional producing areas in the south of the country. However, assuming producers expand soybean plantings in central and western parts, there could be large areas of farmland primed for sowing the second (safrinha) maize crop after the oilseeds are collected in the early part of 2018. Assuming an overall rise and area and normal yield levels, the 2018/19 is forecast to rise by 14.6% year on year, before growth moderates to 3.2% in the 2019/20 season.
Emergency taxes on primary exports will be imposed in Argentina
Soon after assuming office in December 2015 the Argentinean president, Mauricio Macri, moved quickly to abolish export taxes on wheat and maize and introduce a series of gradual cuts for soybeans and products. The move was welcomed by farmers and contributed to a renewed willingness to incorporate maize and wheat back into crop rotations, which had been increasingly dominated by soybeans. However, with the government seeking additional income streams as part of efforts to improve the fiscal situation ahead of a new funding deal with the IMF, and with traders deemed to have benefited from a massive slump in the value of the peso in recent months, the president has opted to introduce emergency taxes on commodity exports. Effective until the end of December 2020, maize exports will be subject to a levy of 4 pesos per US dollar exported, currently equivalent to a tax of 10.5%. The announcement coincided with the start of the 2018/19 sowing season. With interest rates also climbing sharply in recent weeks, potentially raising financing costs for input-intensive maize crops, there are now considerable doubts about maize/soybean cropping mixes for the season ahead. For now we maintain our expectation of a modest increase in area, which could support production of around 41.5m tonnes, a rise of almost 30%. However, with so much uncertainty, this figure could be subject to revision in the months ahead.
A larger than average harvest is predicted in Ukraine
After earlier dryness, the weather in July and August across much of Ukraine was much more favourable for 2018/19 maize crops, boosting yields. Harvesting has now started in all regions, with very good results reported so far. Forecast production is raised by 1.5m tonnes from previously, to 29m tonnes, up by one-fifth from the season before and potentially enough for exports of 23m tonnes, possibly the highest on record. Overseas demand is expected to be very strong in the year ahead, especially from buyers in the EU and China.
Sowings in Russia dropped by 12% year on year
Our 2018/19 production forecast for Russia, where maize has become an increasingly important export crop in recent years, is unchanged at 12.6m tonnes, with the risks skewed very much to the downside. Farmers had been expected to sow even more maize this season, but difficult weather conditions have prompted many to turn instead to oilseeds, planting additional acreage to sunflowerseed, rapeseed and soybeans. Hot weather in key growing regions could also affect yield potential.

Stocks and prices
With the authorities in China keen to reduce burdensome stockpiles, overall supplies have tightened, and global stocks are projected to decline in both 2018/19 and 2019/20. We expect global stocks to ease back to 269m tonnes by end-2018/19, 3% below the previous five-year average. As China remains only a small player on the world stage, importing less than 4m tonnes in a typical year and exporting only limited amounts to North Korea, it is helpful to exclude notional estimates of Chinese inventories (no official data are published) in an analysis of world stocks. Because of some weather problems and overall strong export demand, cumulative inventories in the major suppliers (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and US) are forecast to tighten to 56.3m tonnes at end-2018/19, which would imply a decrease of 10% year on year, potentially the lowest level since 2015/16. While forecasts remain highly notional, a similar trend is projected in 2019/20. Led by further drawdowns in China, world stocks could shrink to around 221m tonnes, including 52.4m tonnes in the top exporters.
Using year-end stockpiles as a gauge for measuring market supplies is the most widely used tool for evaluating the size of surpluses or deficits in a particular year. Leaving aside difficulties with definition and whether stocks can actually be accurately judged at any one particular point in the season, the differences in marketing years between the biggest producers mean that any efforts to assess cumulative stocks are subject to even more uncertainties. For example, with South American stocks typically at their lowest in February and those in the US at their lowest in August, any analysis of combined stocks is inherently flawed, since inventories are never as low (or as high) as suggested by just adding together stocks in individual countries.
China's stock estimates are highly provisional
In mid-July China's State Council announced a country-wide inspection of the quantity and quality of national and local grain reserves, to be conducted over 15 months. The checks will focus on the volume, quality and location of state stocks, and final results are due to be submitted to the State Council by the end of October 2019. According to local press reports, similar inspections were carried out in 2001 and 2009, but the results were not made publicly available. It is therefore unlikely that the outcome of the next survey will be publicly released, although the results are likely to play a major role in determining future policy decisions. We expect stocks to be drawn down in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry. However, given that these stocks are primarily held as a domestic food security measure, this is unlikely to influence global prices.
US ending stocks are expected to drop back to 44.2m tonnes by the end of 2018/19, down by 14% from the year before and potentially a three-year low. Given reduced competition from Brazil, large supplies continue to be sent for export, with ending stocks down by around 14m tonnes from the 30-year highs seen at the end of 2017/18. While supplies are tightening, it should be stressed that the absolute level of stocks remains fairly comfortable and only marginally lower than the average.

After initially gaining on a continued improvement in the US export demand profile and spillover from a rally in wheat, prices turned lower in the second half of the month, dropping by a net 6% from our previous forecast. The recent declines were mainly tied to expectations of a bumper US crop, with a number of scouting tours mostly confirming anecdotal reports of excellent yield potential. As at September 7th average prices were around 9% up on year-earlier levels. Despite much smaller 2017/18 crops in Brazil and Argentina, prices in South America were only a few dollars higher than equivalent US values as new crop supplies began to replenish the exportable pipeline. Traders were also keen to maintain competitiveness with exports out of the US.
In light of a tighter world supply outlook we continue to expect prices to bounce higher from current levels, especially if, as expected, the US-China trade war has little impact on US maize exports. However, given the likelihood of another very large US crop, our price forecast profile has been pared back. US prices (fob Gulf) are now seen as averaging US$176/tonne in 2018, compared with an average of US$195/ tonne in the five-year period ending 2017. Price growth is likely to moderate over the forecast period, with growth of 4.6% per year on average during 2019-20.

Palm oil
Demand
There have been mixed trends in palm oil consumption in the 2017/18 season. Imports into two of the major consumers, India and China, have failed to live up to expectations, while imports into the other major importer, the EU, have been sluggish. Growth in consumption has relied more on the producers of palm oil, notably Indonesia but also Malaysia, both of which recorded double-digit growth rates. Overall, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects palm oil consumption in 2017/18 to rise by 4.5% year on year. While this is above recent averages, it is disappointing in the context of production levels. The energy sector offers the best prospects for improved growth, and we expect above-average consumption growth in the next two years.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
In India, palm oil demand was below expectation throughout 2017/18. Although this is in part accounted for by the imposition of higher import duties, there is concern that it represents a more fundamental shift in demand away from palm oil to other vegetable oils. We have again revised down our consumption estimate for 2017/18. It now seems likely that consumption will fail to match the 2016/17 total of 9.4m tonnes. The import of palm oil via Bangladesh and other countries via a free-trade agreement has the potential to undermine the new import tariff levels. This, coupled with increasing price competitiveness at international level, should mean that Indian palm oil consumption will grow again in 2018/19. Our current forecast is for consumption of 9.7m tonnes, representing an above-average growth rate of 4.3%. However, given the experience of 2017/18, this forecast may yet turn out to be too optimistic.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post solid growth in 2018-19
Indonesian biodiesel production is running ahead of expectations, reflecting the increased competiveness of palm oil as a feedstock following a build-up of local stocks. Improving biodiesel exports, notably to China and the EU, and greater offtake in the domestic market have both contributed to this recent growth. Our estimate of 2017/18 palm oil consumption in Indonesia is raised again. Consumption of 10.4m tonnes is 13% higher than in 2016/17 and makes Indonesia easily the largest consumer of palm oil. There is plenty of spare production capacity in Indonesia, and the authorities plan to increase the domestic incorporation further. From September 2018 all diesel engines are required to run on B20 biodiesel. As a result, we expect consumption to rise by a further 4.5% in 2018/19. Indonesia is also trying to secure palm-based biodiesel facilities overseas by linking its purchase of Boeing and Airbus aeroplanes with the establishment of biodiesel production facilities using palm oil in the US and the EU, which we expect to contribute to further demand growth in 2019/20.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by soybean competition
In China, palm oil continues to face strong competition from soybean oil, but falling palm oil prices and a modest recovery in the instant noodles sector have improved the outlook. We continue to estimate that consumption has risen by 6.4% year on year in 2017/18. While this has ended four consecutive years of decline, this growth level has failed to live up to early-season optimism. The bilateral trade war between the US and China presents an upside risk to palm oil demand; however, there are few indications to date of any increase in Chinese imports of palm oil as a result of this. At the moment we are forecasting modest growth of only 2.4% in 2018/19. While it had been hoped that the domestic biodiesel industry would import significant quantities of palm oil to process, it now seems that imports of biodiesel are the more likely route to meet China's bio-energy requirements.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
In the EU palm oil has become a more attractive feedstock for energy production. This is encouraging growth in palm oil imports and consumption, despite increased competition from imported biodiesel. This growth is expected to continue into the 2018/19-2019/20 seasons. While the long-term future of palm oil in the EU is clouded by legislative issues, we now expect slightly higher demand growth throughout the forecast period, reflecting growing energy use and stable consumption in the food sector.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia is set to rise
Malaysian palm oil demand growth has been limited by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. The implementation of the B10 mandate has been persistently delayed-the most recent government announcements indicate implementation in the second half of 2019. On the plus side, Malaysian exports of biodiesel have been comparatively buoyant, and domestic demand for B7 biodiesel is also reported to be improving. We have increased our estimate of consumption in 2017/18 to 3.2m tonnes, 16.2% above 2016/17 levels. Our forecasts for palm oil consumption in 2018/19 and 2019/20 show good growth, reflecting the improving outlook for biodiesel exports, and to a lesser extent the planned implementation of the B10 incorporation mandate.
Consumption prospects in other countries are broadly positive
The geographical markets for palm oil are diverse, with the top five consumers accounting for less than 55% of global consumption. There have been sharp increases in exports to a number of these destinations, including Pakistan, Iran, the Philippines and various other Asian and African destinations. The largest of these "other" consumers, Pakistan, is likely to show sustained growth, given that attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been mostly unsuccessful. With palm oil prices continuing to fall, there is sustained interest in palm oil from these other consumers.

Supply
The main changes to our output projections from our previous report reflect the the fact that the levels of production in Malaysia continue to disappoint. As a result, we now expect global palm oil production in 2017/18 to be just under 70m tonnes, more than 0.4 tonnes lower than our previous estimate. This reduced total still represents above-average annual growth of 5.7%. A recovery in Malaysian production and continuing growth in Indonesian output should result in 2018/19 palm oil production of more than 72m tonnes-a slowdown in overall growth of 3.1%. This chiefly reflects the slow expansion in the mature area and virtually no yield growth owing to tree stress and potentially lower input use.
Yield cycle may offset favourable growing conditions
Indonesian production of palm oil is now rising seasonally, but we expect output in 2017/18 to remain at 38.3m tonnes, unchanged from our previous forecast. While this growth rate is below recent levels, it is building on particularly rapid growth of 16.4% in 2016/17. We continue to expect good yields over the next 6-9 months, although there are early signs that the rate of growth in yields is slowing. Indeed, slow yield growth has been a persistent feature of Indonesian production: output growth has been more a reflection of increases in harvested area. Despite the slowdown in plantings, the mature area for next season will be higher, albeit by just 3.4%. A modest yield increase would result in palm oil production of just under 40m tonnes, representing below-average output growth. The 40m-tonne barrier is unlikely to be breached until 2019/20.
Malaysian output continues to disappoint
Malaysia's palm oil production continues to disappoint. While output has resumed its normal seasonal increase, recent output levels are almost 20% below those recorded over the same period in 2016/17. This would appear to be the result of some workers taking extended leave and a higher than expected replanting rate, as well as a downturn in the biological yield cycle. We have again revised down our estimate for 2017/18 production to just below 20m tonnes. Some local estimates put the total even lower. Despite the downgrade output will still be some 5.8% higher than in 2016/17. The 2018/19 season should see an increase in average yields, although any improvements will inhibited by an ageing tree population. We have adopted a relatively cautious production forecast of 20.4m tonnes in 2018/19, only 2% higher than in 2017/18.

Thailand output exceeds expectations
There has been a recent slowdown in yield growth in both Thailand and Colombia. The increase in yields in Thailand during 2017/18 has been especially strong, reflecting good weather and favourable oil extraction rates. While our estimate for 2017/18 is little changed, we expect a reduction in output in 2018/19 as tree stress and the probable use of lower inputs reduce yields. In Colombia, we have reduced both our estimate of output in 2017/18 and our production forecast for 2018/19. There remains potential for further land for palm oil cultivation without any deforestation issues. Recent yields have been well above year-earlier levels but should revert to more normal levels in 2018/19 and 2019/20. Some other smaller palm oil-producing countries, such as Honduras, will also see solid output growth in 2017/18.
Stocks and prices
Palm oil stocks in both Indonesia and Malaysia have continued to rise. By contrast, stock levels in importing countries are at normal or slightly below normal levels. Overall, 2017/18 continues to show a market surplus, albeit a smaller one than previously forecast. At the end of the season stocks will be the equivalent of 65 days of consumption. This is below the level recorded in 2014/15 but still above normal levels. The 2018/19 season looks set to show another (albeit smaller) market surplus, while early projections suggest that the 2019/20 season may be more or less in balance.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further
As predicted, physical palm oil prices continued to weaken in August. Indeed, the decrease was larger than expected, with prices standing at less than US$600/tonne, a level that we had not expected to see until mid-2019. Futures prices traded within a narrow range during the month, suggesting that market participants believe that the market has reached bottom or is close to it. However, we continue to expect global palm oil prices to drift lower during the rest of 2018 and into 2019. These predictions are based on our expectation of only moderate consumption levels during 2018/19. On current projections, prices should tend to stabilise and even increase as the 2019/20 season approaches. Further downgrades to Malaysian production forecasts or a pick-up in demand are the factors most likely to lead to a more bullish outlook.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
Despite higher estimates of rapeseed oil consumption in the EU, China and India, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global rapeseed oil consumption to fall in 2017/18 for the third consecutive season. At just over 25m tonnes, 2017/18 consumption is at its lowest level since 2012/13. Rapeseed oil is suffering from increasing price competition from sunflowerseed oil, which has not been offset by higher mineral oil prices. Recent increases in rapeseed oil prices, following downgrades to future production prospects, are likely to constrain consumption growth in 2018/19 further. We have reduced our projections of 2018/19 consumption in almost all the major consumers and are forecasting an overall total of 25.3m tonnes, just 0.5% above 2017/18 levels. Further downward revisions may be necessary.
EU consumption is threatened by biodiesel imports
For most of the 2017/18 season the use of rapeseed oil in the EU's biodiesel sector has faced strong competition from recycled cooking oil and from imported biodiesel. Nevertheless, there has recently been an upturn in demand for rapeseed oil from the biodiesel sector, which has prompted us to increase our estimate of 2017/18 consumption to just over 10m tonnes. However, the reduction in likely local availability will cut short any consumption gains during 2018/19. We expect consumption to fall to 9.9m tonnes and to remain fairly flat in 2019/20. This forecast implies significant imports of either rapeseed for local crushing or rapeseed oil, which will depend on the final outcome of the Canadian and Australian crops.
Chinese consumption is limited by supply constraints
In China, local rapeseed oil availability is limited, despite recent improvements in local crushing of imported rapeseed, and this has been acting as a constraint on consumption. Rapeseed oil imports into China have continued to rise, justifying a further increase in our 2017/18 estimate of consumption to 4.8m tonnes. Despite the increase, this total still represents the lowest consumption level in the last ten years. Higher local estimates of rapeseed production in 2018/19 should help to boost consumption. However, competition for imported rapeseed for local crushing as well as for imported rapeseed oil is likely to be intense. At this stage we project 2018/19 rapeseed oil consumption at just over 5.2m tonnes; given the competition for available supplies, this total may turn out to be too optimistic.
India's consumption will rebound in 2017/18
In India, 2017/18 rapeseed oil consumption has been encouraged by improved local availability and strong GDP growth. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil in north and central India, which typically absorbs local production along with a small, but increasing, volume of imports. However, import volumes are being inhibited by high import duties. With local rapeseed oil production expected to contract, we anticipate that 2018/19 consumption will also be lower, with consumption falling back to 2.6m tonnes, some 5% less than in 2017/18 but still above the previous five-year average.
Only modest demand growth is likely in the US market
In the US, rapeseed oil has been losing out to cheaper soybean oil over recent months. This pattern has continued, and our assessment of rapeseed oil consumption in the US is further reduced. This position is likely to recur in 2018/19, inhibiting any substantial recovery in rapeseed oil use.
Several smaller consumers which switched away from rapeseed oil in 2016/17 have recently returned to the market. However, growth in rapeseed oil consumption among this "other" consumers category during 2017/18 has been constrained by more competitive sunflowerseed oil.

Supply
A late surge in rapeseed crushings in the EU, Canada and India has resulted in an increase in our estimate of global rapeseed oil production in 2017/18. Our estimate of 2017/18 output now stands at 25.6m tonnes, almost 2% higher than in the 2016/17 season. However, prospects for global rapeseed production in 2018/19 have been adversely affected by dry conditions in the EU, Canada and Australia. The major impact to date has been in the EU and Canada, with a substantial downgrading of crop estimates. Even allowing for a significant reduction in rapeseed stocks, rapeseed oil output in 2018/19 is likely to be below 2017/18 levels, at just above 25m tonnes.
Weaker demand is weighing on EU rapeseed oil production
Recent levels of EU rapeseed oil production have exceeded earlier expectations. For the 2017/18 season as a whole we now expect production to reach 10.1m tonnes, less than 1% lower than in 2016/17. However, the 2018/19 crop has been badly affected by the hot and dry summer. Estimates of the size of the harvest continue to fall, with the latest European Commission forecast putting the total at only 19.2m tonnes. This would be the smallest crop since 2008/09. Even allowing for high carry-in stocks and higher rapeseed imports, 2018/19 rapeseed oil production will be affected by the low seed production level. For the moment we have retained our forecast of EU rapeseed oil output of 9.5m tonnes in 2018/19. However, this is contingent on a significant increase in rapeseed imports, which may be at risk if the more pessimistic forecasts of Canadian and Australian seed production are realised.
China will rely on imports for oil production
Chinese rapeseed oil production is becoming increasingly dependent on imported seed supplies. Our estimate of 2017/18 rapeseed oil production remains unchanged at 3.7m tonnes, only 1.7% higher than 2016/17. The uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on imports of US soybeans has not yet impacted rapeseed import levels. Despite dry conditions in many areas, the rapeseed crop appears to have reached the earlier forecast of 5.3m tonnes. We continue to expect rapeseed oil production to expand in 2018/19, the second consecutive year of growth. Early indications of increased volumes of rapeseed imports, along with the bigger domestic crop, have encouraged us to raise our 2018/19 rapeseed oil production forecast to 3.9m tonnes. Demand for rapeseed meal is reported to be increasing, helping to increase rapeseed crush margins in China.
Canada's 2017/18 harvest will rise
2017/18 Canadian canola oil production continues to exceed expectations, encouraged by strong exports of canola oil. An upward revision to our estimate means that 2017/18 canola oil output could reach almost 4.2m tonnes. For 2018/19 Statistics Canada's most recent estimate puts canola production at only 19.2m tonnes. This is well below most trade estimates, although a reduction had been expected as a result of the hot and dry conditions in many areas through August. Trade assessments suggest a crop just above 20m tonnes, which is consistent with the most recent harvest reports. Canadian canola oil production is typically more dependent on market developments than on the availability of seed for crushing. Yet the smaller crop estimates suggest that competition for available canola seed for crushing will be intense. We have therefore reduced our canola oil production forecast in to 4.3m tonnes in 2018/19, although we expect a rebound to 4.6m tonnes in 2019/20.
India's production is set to grow owing to higher rapeseed imports
In India, 2017/18 rapeseed oil production has exceeded previous expectations. We now estimate that output reached a new record of more than 2.5m tonnes. For 2018/19 the area under rapeseed is expected to show a small increase, in part reflecting the government's actions to boost production (measures include higher vegetable import tariffs and increased minimum support prices). At this early stage it is thought that yields will not match the 2017/18 high levels, but given good planting conditions they are likely to remain above average; this would result in a harvest only slightly smaller than 2017/18. For the moment we have retained our forecast of 2018/19 rapeseed oil production of 2.4m tonnes.
Australian production could be constrained by dry conditions
There are increasing concerns over the 2018/19 Australian canola crop. Estimates now put the likely output at 3.1m tonnes, 15% lower than 2017/18. The estimate of 2018/19 Ukraine rapeseed production is raised and now stands at 2.7m tonnes. Rapeseed is reportedly the most profitable of the oilseed crops in Ukraine, and further expansion of the area planted to rapeseed is expected.

Stocks and prices
We estimate global rapeseed oil stocks to have risen in 2017/18 on the back of a market surplus. However, the surplus is estimated to be lower than previously thought, given revisions to our supply and consumption estimates in this report. When measured as a share of consumption, oil stocks will remain well below the average in recent years. Rapeseed stocks will also be below normal levels at end-2017/18. The production downgrade for 2018/19 means that the season will now see a market deficit, with rapeseed oil stocks ending the season at very low levels. Rapeseed stocks are also expected to be below normal at the end of 2018/19, reaching levels (measured in terms of days of consumption) not seen since 2012/13.

Concern over production leads to firmer prices
The impending tightness of the rapeseed oil market is being reflected in increasing prices. Physical prices of rapeseed oil continued to rise in August and are now trading at a high premium relative to other major vegetable oils. Futures prices for rapeseed have also been firmer, although they tended to ease in the latter part of August. The downgrading of crop estimates has reinforced the bullish outlook for rapeseed oil prices, and we continue to expect prices to rise steadily for the foreseeable future. Although gains will be constrained by the prices of other oils, rapeseed oil prices are expected to exceed US$900/tonne by the third quarter of 2019.

Rice
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global rice consumption will rise by 1.4% in 2018/19, to a record of just over 500m tonnes. As is usual, Asian markets, which account for an estimated 90% of world use, will drive the predicted expansion, notably via increased demand in India. Smaller increases are likely elsewhere in East and South Asia, as well as in Latin America and Africa. Prospects for the following season remain tentative, especially since we are referring to an international trade year that will not commence until January 1st 2020. Nevertheless, global demand is expected to continue on an upward trajectory in 2019/20, again rising by 1.4%, to reach 507m tonnes.
Rice feed use may edge up on increased uptake in China
The use of rice in animal feed mixes could actually edge up in both years, largely owing to events in China, by far the biggest consumer. With the government keen to avoid the potential for a further build-up of inventories, it is looking to scale back production and possibly imports. In addition, both domestic and export markets offer another way of reducing inventories. While food use per head could edge lower, it is likely that consumption in feed sectors could grow further as the government encourages the disposal of inventories through feed channels.
Japan has utilised stocks of imported rice in feed mixes, but data suggest that demand for domestic rice feed may have peaked. Overall, the non-food usage of rice globally (including by the industrial sector) will continue to account for only a small proportion of overall demand.
Trade should remain robust in 2019-20
Africa and Asia account for more than two-thirds of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met through imports. Following record global rice purchases in 2017, of 45.4m tonnes, many Asian buyers are likely to be well stocked. Furthermore, strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. In light of strong demand from Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines in the first half of the year, we expected global trade to increase by around 4%, to some 47m tonnes in 2018, with similar volumes likely in 2019. In 2020 we expect demand from key buyers in Asia and Africa to push up trade to a high of almost 48m tonnes-more than 50% above the level seen a decade earlier. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that trade would still acount for less than 10% of total production or consumption-an exceptionally low share when compared to wheat (the other major food grain) or soybeans.
China's imports are likely to fall over the forecast period
China is by far the world's largest consumer of rice, accounting for almost 30% of global demand. Although locally produced rice makes up the bulk of national consumption, China is also the world's largest importer. Domestic early-season long-grain milled rice still commands hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China. We expect China's purchases to peak at 5m tonnes in 2018 before declining slightly in the following two years. Although it remains unclear how lower state support will impact rice imports, for now we think that imports are likely to fall in future years as the government seeks to reduce inventories. Nonetheless, volumes are likely to remain substantial, given that local prices are above international values. Although we expect rice imports to fall to 4.1m tonnes by 2020, China would still be the world's biggest importer.
Bangladesh's imports set to fall in 2019-20 as local supplies improve
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. The three domestic crops cut each year are the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July); and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs is met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market, especially in times of shortages. Purchases in 2018 are expected to reach 2m tonnes-more than three times the 2017 level-before falling again in 2019 and 2020 as domestic supply improves.
The Philippines is expected to remain a key buyer
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in about a decade. In contrast, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports are estimated to have risen further in 2018, to reach 1.6m tonnes, and are expected to average close to 1.5m tonnes annually in coming years as the country looks to ensure adequate domestic supplies.
Solid growth in Saudi consumption of cereals
In Saudi Arabia, consumption of cereals, including rice, has posted strong growth over the past two decades. As the preferred ingredient for inclusion in feed rations, barley accounts for more than half of aggregate domestic demand, while growth in the use of other commodities, including wheat and maize in the food and feed sector, respectively, has been particularly notable.
Rice is a staple food, with kabsah, a traditional dish, being consumed widely. In addition, significant volumes are eaten by foreign workers, chiefly from South Asia. However, demand for white rice among middle- and high-income families has fallen, reflecting a shift towards an increased uptake of protein as well as fruits and vegetables. Overall, therefore, growth in rice consumption has been relatively modest. Consumption is forecast at around 1.3m tonnes in both 2018/19 and 2019/20, little changed on the previous year, and only marginally higher than the 1.1m tonnes seen a decade ago.
Saudi Arabia's local market is one of the largest in the Middle East
Nevertheless, the domestic rice market in Saudi Arabia remains one the largest in the Middle East-comparable in size to Iraq and second only to Iran. As climate conditions do not allow for domestic rice cultivation, local market needs are met entirely through imports, which are typically of a very high quality and consist mainly of fragrant-especially basmati-varieties. The origins of the nation's international rice purchases have changed little over the years, with South Asian exporters the most important suppliers. Purchases from India and Pakistan are predominantly of basmati varieties, with relatively smaller quantities of high-quality white and parboiled types secured from a range of origins, including Thailand, Vietnam, the US, China and Australia.

Supply
We expect global rice production to inch up by 0.3% in 2018/19, to a record 494m tonnes. Achieving this will depend on harvest outcomes in Asia's main producers, primarily India, where the monsoon season began on June 1st. Given that only a small expansion of planted area is likely, an increase in global output will depend on improved yields. All of our scenarios assume continued state support for farmers in Asia, as recently announced in India, although seeding in China is likely to fall as the authorities seek to reduce production-and possibly imports-to draw down excess inventories. In 2019/20 marginal acreage expansion and trend yields should boost production by 1.1%, to a new record of 499m tonnes.
India's kharif crop harvest remains central to global output prospects
In any year global prospects are to a large degree shaped by India's main summer-sown (kharif) crop, which is crucial in terms of domestic supplies and the surplus available for export. Most recent government data show that sowings were completed on 37m ha by the end of August, slightly ahead of both the previous year and the five-year average. After progressing slowly, the pace of seeding has improved, which is probably linked to a pick-up in the intensity of the monsoon in some growing regions compared with earlier in the season. By September 9th cumulative full-season rainfall (since June 1st) was estimated to be 7% below the long-term average.
The government has raised kharif support prices
Earlier in the season the government announced that it had lifted minimum support prices for all 2018/19 kharif crops, including a 13% rise for common-grade paddy (rice) to Rs1,750 (US$24) per tonne. Assuming that rains are in line with normal levels in the main rice-growing areas, total production in 2018/19, which also includes the relatively tiny winter-seeded (rabi) crop, is forecast at a record 113m tonnes, up from 111m tonnes in the preceding season. Output may reach 116m tonnes in the following year, given continued farmer support and a good monsoon.
India will remain the largest global exporter
India has been the world's largest exporter of rice since 2011. Volumes have been shaped by demand for high-value basmati varieties from buyers in Europe and the Middle East, as well as shipments of low-quality white and parboiled rice primarily to markets in Africa and Asia. We estimate that India's full-year rice exports rose to 12.2m tonnes in 2018, up from 11.7m tonnes in the previous season. Exports are currently running below the levels necessary for such a rise, but we expect their pace to accelerate in the remainder of the season, given that prices have fallen at most major origins and that African buyers are likely to return to the world market. In the following two years the outlook for exports will ultimately be linked to kharif crop outcomes. Nevertheless, assuming that availabilities remain ample, India will retain its status as the world's largest exporter, with deliveries to global markets reaching nearly 13m tonnes by the end of our forecast period.
Drought conditions in Pakistan harm rice production prospects
The rice crop outlook in Pakistan is uncertain owing to water shortages in the main producing areas, following persistent below-average rainfall since the end of 2017. Water availability in the main reservoirs is estimated to be more than 50% below average, constraining planting operations.
A reduced crop will tighten exportable supplies
Rice sowings usually commence in the later stages of May and early June in southern areas of the country, while cultivation in northern areas usually takes place in late July. However, in the current season fieldwork was as much as 45 days behind schedule. Some growers will therefore seed much less than anticipated, and yield potential could be significantly down. While the situation may have improved owing to increased monsoon rains we now expect output in 2018/19 to fall by 2.8% year on year, to 6.8m tonnes (from 7m tonnes previously). This will have a knock-on impact on export volumes, given that around half of the crop is typically exported. We project that a crop of 6.8m tonnes would support exports of 3.8m tonnes in 2019, down from 4.1m tonnes in the preceding season. In the following year shipments are likely to edge up again as better crops are harvested.
The Chinese government is keen to reduce inventory levels
Following a fall of 4m tonnes (year on year) in 2018/19, rice production in China is likely to drop further in 2019/20, to an eight-year low of 140.5m tonnes because of acreage reductions. The Chinese government aims to reduce rice acreage by around 2% in 2018/19 by scaling back low-quality rice production. Ultimately, this is meant to address the significant structural imbalance between domestic supply and demand. In late April the Communist Party leadership of Hunan Province stated that it aimed to reduce plantings by 200,000 ha in the province during the current year, shifting land to high-value specialty rice crops. This development is significant, since state policy had previously been geared towards stabilising or increasing paddy (rice) output. Acreage has changed little over the years, so a fall of 2% would represent the first significant decline since 2003/04. Furthermore, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) outlined lower minimum purchasing prices in early 2018 across all types of rice, with falls of between 8% and 11% noted. This is important, because it represents the second consecutive annual cut in farmer support and suggests that the government is aware that supply and demand must be rebalanced owing to burdensome inventories.
The government has also announced a reform of its minimum price support scheme for rice. This year's programme sets stricter conditions for activating minimum price procurement-which can only take place when the market price has remained below the minimum set price for three consecutive days. The scheme must be suspended once the market price exceeds the minimum support price for another three days. This latest policy shift illustrates further the administration's eagerness to reshape the rice sector by introducing market-based conditions under which rice will be procured from farmers. As with efforts to reduce the production of low-quality indica rice, this underlines the government's awareness that domestic stock levels are unsustainably high.
Exports offer a convenient way for China to reduce stocks
Procurement of early indica rice runs from August 1st-September 30th, while middle and late indica rice procurement runs from October 10th until January 31st. Japonica rice procurement commences on November 1st and must close by the end of February. China's exports of rice have traditionally been nominal and shaped by sales of japonica varieties, including to Japan and South Korea, for example. However, there was a big shift in 2017, with shipments rising sharply, largely owing to sales of indica rice to African nations. These included particularly substantial deliveries to Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Prospects for exports are somewhat uncertain at this stage. Nevertheless, the export market offers a viable way of reducing state reserves during the next two years. We anticipate shipments to African nations to remain significant as total exports range between 1m tonnes and 2m tonnes.
Thailand's main crop prospects boosted by good rainfall
Prospects for rice production in Thailand in 2018/19 were boosted by above-average precipitation in the first half of 2018, and the government meteorological office expects rainfall to remain above average thoughout the crop's main reproductive stage to end-October. Due to expanded acreage amid high farm-gate prices for fragrant paddy and with yields expected to be better than in the previous season, total rice output in 2018/19 is predicted to expand by 1m tonnes (5%) to 21.5m tonnes. This includes an assumption of increased secondary (off-season) plantings.
Thailand's exports will remain below those of India
Thailand's exports of all varieties of rice totalled 11.5m tonnes in 2017-easily its highest total and up from 9.9m tonnes the year before. The strong increase was mainly attributable to a large expansion of shipments to markets in Africa, with a portion almost certainly consisting of older intervention reserves from the government's long-held stockpile. Since the government is reported to have sold off food-quality stocks from past harvests last year, exporters will have no access to significant quantities of attractively priced inventories that can be sold to buyers in Africa and other regions. We expect export volumes to fall to 10.5m tonnes in 2018, down from 11.5m tonnes in 2017, largely owing to lower volumes going to African countries and China. Although sales could trend up slightly in 2019-20, they will remain well behind India's volumes.
Elsewhere in Asia, Vietnam's exports have progressed solidly during 2018, with data from the General Statistics Office placing the January-August tally at 4.4m tonnes, a rise of 8% year on year. However, in the absence of a significant increase in cultivation and production, shipments are likely to remain below 7m tonnes over the remainder of the forecast period.
The US crop is expected to rebound strongly
Conditions for the next US outturn remain broadly positive, with recent weekly crop progress reports issued by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimating that 75% of paddy fields were in good or excellent condition as of September 2nd-a significant improvement on levels in late July and in the year-earlier period. In addition, harvesting was about one-third finished, also ahead of the previous year. Based on long-grain area gains, total acreage in the US is expected to expand by 20% year on year, and assuming on-trend yields, production in 2018/19 should rebound to reach 6.8m tonnes. Given that a larger crop should ensure that availabilities are much improved, exports in 2019 are likely to expand to 3.6m tonnes, up from 3.2m tonnes in the previous season. In the following year much depends on prevailing prices ahead of planting; we tentatively expect an average-sized crop and exports of around 3.7m tonnes.
Rice production puts pressure on Egyptian water supplies
Egypt has traditionally been a relatively small but important rice-producing country. Although the bulk of its crop is channelled to the local market, it has also been a modest exporter of medium-grain varieties to global markets, competing with nations such as the US and Australia. The government has for a number of years been using restrictions on exports to ensure availabilities for local consumption. It is now seeking to reduce the cultivation of water-intensive crops, including rice. According to reports, 1,400 litres of water are used in the production of 1 kg of rice, with agriculture accounting for an estimated 80% of Egypt's total water resources. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation has announced a reduction of more than 30% year on year in the approved rice area in 2018/19, to 304,080 ha. According to local reports, this is because farmers have grown more rice than the government's allotted total during the previous year. In addition, growers have faced financial penalties for exceeding the official area target.

Large-scale imports could feature in the longer term
Given that rice cultivation in Egypt is attractive for farmers, it seems possible that growers could again boost plantings above the allotted target. Nevertheless, we still anticipate a fall in output in 2018/19 of about 1m tonnes, to 3.3m tonnes, the lowest in eight seasons. Although local demand has been falling in recent years as the population increasingly turns to alternative, cheaper forms of carbohydrates, such as pasta, imports of rice are likely to rise to 300,000 tonnes, but this is still small in terms of the overall supply-and-demand balance sheet. However, the Egyptian prime minister, Sherif Ismail, has announced that the country would import rice so as to increase stocks and control the market. While no timeframe was provided, the statement could be significant, potentially signalling a switch to large-scale imports as production continues to fall. Some traders and analysts have suggested that purchases from the world market could end up totalling as much as 1m tonnes/year. Exports are expected to remain officially banned in 2018-19. However, modest amounts-around 50,000 tonnes per year-are expected to find their way on to international market, as has been the case in recent years during times of restrictions.
Stocks and prices
World end-season inventories in 2018/19 are likely to tighten, reflecting lower inventories held by the world's leading exporters, primarily India and Thailand. In China, too, the government is encouraging farmers to scale back production of low-quality rice and diversify into high-value varieties as a means of preventing further excessive growth of inventories. Accordingly, we anticipate some reduction in stocks there in 2018/19 after many years of accumulation.
Caution is generally advised when analysing stocks data, reflecting the fact that the bulk of year-end figures provided is arrived at via residual calculation, as most countries do not collect or provide meaningful figures. Furthermore, inventories in China on a milled weight tonnage-equivalent could total as much as 70m-80m tonnes. However, since no official data are published, it is likely that the actual level of stocks could be vastly different from consensus estimates. As we have previously noted, the exclusion of Chinese stocks therefore produces a more realistic figure for what is available on the world market, mostly located in the five major exporters, and specifically in India.

Asian markets for white and parboiled grades of rice generally showed differing trends in August and early September. In Thailand and Vietnam offers for the main grades for export were mostly judged to be steady or slightly firmer, although international demand remained steady at most origins. In Vietnam, where the underlying pace of sales has been fairly robust during 2018, slower buying in recent weeks exerted a bearish influence on the market. Nevertheless, rumours of future tenders by some Asian importers helped to push up prices slightly. In Thailand, quotations for 100% B were unchanged over the month, at US$394/tonne fob Bangkok, while the 5% broken grade in Vietnam increased by US$8, to US$394/tonne fob Ho Chi Minh.
In India, by contrast, markets for white rice have weakened over the past four weeks, with the 5% grade dropping by 3% month on month, to US$392/tonne fob, tcomparable with other origins. Supply and demand fundamentals were little changed, although the approach of the nation's main crop will have had a minor impact. It seems that the fall was more to do with currency movements as the Indian rupee lost value against the US dollar. Elsewhere in South Asia there were heightened worries about drought conditions in Pakistan, with planting of the monsoon crop as much as two months behind schedule in some parts of Sindh province, fuelling concerns that production could be much smaller than in the previous season.
Recent price declines have depressed the 2018-19 outlook
Mainly reflecting strength during the early part of the year, especially in the second quarter, the average 2018 price of 100% B in Thailand is estimated at US$404/tonne fob Bangkok, a 3.7% year-on-year increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period through to the third quarter of 2020 export quotations at all leading origins could strengthen, which would be consistent with expectations of tighter global stocks, including in major suppliers to the world market. To some extent, however, the potential for higher prices may be limited by the fact that much of the fall in inventories could be due to a policy-driven adjustment in China.

Soybeans
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global soybean consumption to have increased for the ninth consecutive year in 2017/18, to a record 337m tonnes, with growth of 3.9% well below the four year average of 5.3%. In 2018/19 we anticipate further growth in consumption of around 4.5%, to 352m tonnes. Projections for 2019/20 are extremely tentative, and much will depend on whether the current US-China bilateral trade war can be resolved. Factoring in potentially below-par expansion in China, world consumption is tentatively seen at 358m tonnes, up by 1.7% year on year in 2019/20.
The principal driver of the near-uninterrupted expansion of demand over the past decade has been rising use in Asia, mostly China, underpinned by the increasing uptake in that country's vast feed sector. While the poultry, livestock and dairy sectors have made the greatest contribution, the aquaculture sector has become an increasingly important source of growth, with soybean meal the feed ingredient of choice owing to its abundance and high protein content. Soybean consumption in other regions is relatively small but has also risen steadily in recent years, with notable increases in the Middle East and Africa.
Overall consumption growth in China is likely to moderate in 2018-19 compared with recent years, assuming that rising trade barriers cause China to reduce its purchases from the world market slightly. Nevertheless, consistent with our expectations of larger shipments by the US to other markets, growth in demand in other regions, including the EU, will compensate. Furthermore, a recovery in Argentina's production would boost supplies for local processing as consumption there rebounds.
We forecast that global trade in soybeans in 2018/19 (September/October basis) will reach 154m tonnes. While China's purchases may actually fall, this will be more than offset by bigger imports by other buyers. Chinese purchases of US soybeans have floundered since April as bilateral trade tensions have escalated. The impact on Chinese processors has been limited, since this period coincided with the southern hemisphere export programme. Nevertheless, even before April China's imports of US supplies were much smaller than in the previous season owing to big purchases from Brazil between October 2017 and January 2018. More recently Chinese demand has reportedly slowed owing to heavy stocks and an erosion of processing margins.
The 2018/19 trade year is characterised by a great deal of uncertainty regarding China's needs owing to the implementation of a 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US, which came into effect on July 6th. Nonetheless, the US-China trade war is unlikely to dent soybean demand significantly as China will probably source more from other origins, primarily Brazil. Additionally, industry and trade sources suggest that purchases of other feed ingredients, such as rapeseed/canola, sunflowerseed and possibly even soybean meal, could compensate for any shortfall. Nevertheless, supplies at South American origins are likely to be tighter than normal from October 2018 onwards until new crops are threshed in early 2019. As a result, it is possible that even with the import tariffs in place, Chinese buyers will be required to source as much as 15m tonnes from the US in 2018/19-although this is well below its purchases of around 30m tonnes per year in recent years. China's total imports are forecast to fall by 1.5% in 2018/19-the first fall in eight years-and are expected to remain at this level in 2019/20.
China's massive pork industry accounts for around one-third of global consumption of soybean meal, a major feed ingredient for pigs. The recent outbreak of African swine fever in a number of Chinese provinces is therefore of huge importance for the soybean market and could have substantial implications for future demand. The authorities have moved swiftly to control the outbreak, culling thousands of animals and introducing bans on live animal transportation and markets in affected areas. However, new cases were being reported on an almost daily basis in early September. The effects on local feed demand are difficult to assess at this early stage, however. For now, our forecasts for soybean demand in China are unchanged: despite lower imports in 2018/19 we expect higher domestic output and some destocking to support overall demand growth of 5% year on year in 2019/20. However, we will keep an eye on these events and adjust our forecast accordingly.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
US soybean consumption in 2017/18 is estimated to reach an all-time high of nearly 59m tonnes, growing by 5.7% year on year, after a large crop boosted supplies for processing. In addition to local feed sector needs, strong international demand for soymeal-owing to reduced supplies from drought-hit Argentina-has boosted local crushing. We expect another large crop in 2018/19 to support further consumption growth of 1.5% year on year, before declining by 0.5% in 2019/20.
In South America the outlook for consumption is weak, largely reflecting trends in Argentina, where we expect consumption to contract by 5.4% in 2017/18-the first contraction in five seasons-after a heavily reduced crop tightened availabilities for processing. While ample domestic stocks and a reduction in export volumes have helped to ease the impact on domestic availability, some growers may hold on to inventories as export taxes are gradually reduced. In 2018/19 and 2019/20, assuming a recovery in soybean production and with firm demand for soybean product exports, domestic processing and total consumption should rebound by 5.3% per year on average.

Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successive record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall consumption. The remainder is typically met by imports of soybeans and soybean meal, typically accounting for up to 35m tonnes. In 2017/18 soybean imports are expected to rise by 3.9% after the previous season's fall. In recent months EU import demand has strengthened as buyers have taken advantage of the heavy fall in US market prices. With a poor rapeseed/canola crop on the horizon, another season of increased imports is expected in 2018/19-2019/20, with consumption forecast to grow by 3.1% per year on average.
Supply
Boosted by larger plantings in the US and Brazil as well as increases in relatively smaller players such as Canada, eastern Europe, China and the EU, global sowings are estimated to have risen by 4% year on year in 2017/18 to their highest ever level. However, with yields being compromised by adverse weather in some countries-most notably Argentina, where crops were first ravaged by drought and then impacted by heavy rains and flooding during harvesting-global production is estimated to have contracted by 3.8% year on year, to 335m tonnes. Nonetheless, this is still about 30m tonnes higher than the average of the previous five seasons. The outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, but with a further expansion of seeded area likely-led by growth in South America-output could recover to 365m tonnes, a year-on-year increase of 8.9%. Our very early projections for 2019/20 suggest that US plantings could decline, with farmers perhaps switching to maize and spring wheat. Even if South American crops are larger, world production might therefore dip to 358m tonnes, down by 2.1% year on year.
US yields are expected to be very good in 2018/19
US farmers have enjoyed generally favourable cropping conditions over the spring and summer. With plantings completed on time, the weather in June and July was warm and wet in many areas, setting the scene for successful pod filling in August, the key month for determining soybean yields. The mostly favourable weather has continued in recent weeks, and the first objective yield survey assessment from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests that average yields will be only slightly down on the 2016/17 record. According to the agency, expectations for pod weight (and yields) will benefit from this season's extended period of crop development. Incorporating this uprated yield figure, we have raised our production forecast by 6.8m tonnes to an unprecedented 124.8m tonnes, up by 4.4% on the previous season.
US farmers will be compensated for ongoing trade disputes
On September 4th the USDA formally launched a US$12bn aid package aimed at assisting local farmers hit by current international trade disputes. The flagship Market Facilitation Programme will provide payments to eligible producers of soybeans, wheat, maize, sorghum, cotton, dairy and pigs. Payments will be made on 50% of actual 2018/19 production volumes, with soybean growers eligible for a payment of US$1.65/bushel, up to a maximum of US$125,000 per farm. Additionally, a Trade Promotion Programme will assist in developing new export markets, while a Food Purchase and Distribution Programme will purchase surpluses of certain affected commodities for distribution through nutrition assistance programmes. While the payments were well received in certain quarters, most farm groups have reiterated their desire for a resolution to the trade disputes with major US trade partners and called for a more permanent solution.
Brazil is on course to smash its existing record for exports
After progressing slowly in the first quarter of its 2018/19 local marketing year (starting February 1st), Brazil's exports have surged owing to robust demand from Asia, with volumes hitting respective monthly records in May, June and July. This was achieved despite major logistical challenges and disruption to transport flows caused by industrial action by hauliers and brought cumulative exports in 2017/18 (October-July) to more than 63m tonnes, the biggest amount ever dispatched in that period. This suggests that the full-year total will exceed 70m tonnes, despite a slowdown in spot demand from Chinese importers. Although the outlook for 2018/19 remains uncertain, we have factored in further growth in Brazil's exports to a record 75m tonnes as the US-China trade war continues, allowing Brazil to capture a larger share of China's import needs.
Brazil's 2018/19 growing season is subject to much uncertainty
Brazil's economic and political landscape is challenging for farmers, with exchange-rate uncertainty, higher freight costs, US-China trade relations and Brazil's 2018 presidential election contributing to heightened market uncertainty. The Brazilian Real has fluctuated significantly against the US dollar in the first half of 2018 and is down by around one-third compared with the same point last year. On the one hand, a weaker Real could encourage expanded acreage through higher domestic prices, as has been the case in previous years. Highlighting this point, although export quotations (from Paranagua ports) have risen modestly, the increase in local values has been much more significant, at around 30%. While area gains may come from a shift of some area from full-season corn to soybeans in southern regions, it may also be due to the seeding of soybeans on new lands. On the other hand, however, the weaker Real will inflate production costs, including imported inputs such as fertilisers.
Just weeks before the start of Brazil's new crop planting season in September, a decision by a federal judge to ban the use of products containing the agrochemical glyphosate caused alarm across the agricultural sector. Glyphosate is used extensively across the country, with many soybean farmers now practising no-till production, whereby plants are seeded directly into existing crop residue, with weeds controlled by chemicals rather than through ploughing the seedbed. The decision drew widespread criticism, including from the agriculture minister, who expressed doubts that farmers would even comply with such a ruling. Following an appeal by the Attorney General, the decision was overturned in early September, clearing the way for the use of glyphosate in the 2018/19 season.
However, problems with inland transport costs remain broadly unresolved. With local supplies mainly transported by lorry from producing areas to ports, recent legislation instituting minimum freight rates has had a big impact on the agricultural sector, squeezing profit margins. The costs of transporting fertiliser and other key farm inputs in the other direction, from ports to farms, has also increased in recent months. Brazil's Supreme Court has held a series of public hearings over the new minimum freight rates, introduced to appease independent lorry drivers, who launched a damaging nationwide strike in May. However, a decision on the law's constitutionality is not expected to be made until November.
Soybean area is set to increase even further in Brazil
Despite background uncertainty about freight costs, worries about the rising costs of production and volatility in foreign-exchange markets, the allure of high prices and potentially huge demand from China are expected to encourage a twelfth successive increase in soybean area in 2018/19. The earliest planting will start around the middle of September, continuing until the end of December, with harvesting starting normally just after the turn of the year. With forecasts unchanged from last time, we continue to predict a 4% increase in acreage, a new record. Assuming that productivity is broadly in line with trend, output is projected to grow by 1.3% per year in 2018/19-19/20 to a new high of 121m tonnes by the end of the forecast period.
Adverse weather conditions hamper fieldwork in Argentina
In Argentina's 2017/18 season yield potential was damaged irrecoverably by hot and dry weather, followed by heavy rains across key growing regions that led to delays to harvesting, crop losses and an erosion of quality. At 35m tonnes, production is estimated to have contracted by nearly 40% year on year. This has significantly reduced Argentina's presence in the export markets for soybeans and soybean meal, despite unusually heavy purchases of soybeans from the US and Paraguay for local processing. Soybean exports in 2017/18 are expected to total only 3m tonnes, the smallest volume in many years and less than half the amount shipped in 2016/17.
Faced with another financial crisis and the need to appease the IMF ahead of a new loan agreement, the authorities in Argentina have once again turned to grain and oilseed exporters as a source of much-needed revenue. With agricultural exporters deemed to have benefited from the massive drop in the value of the peso in recent months, the president has reneged on previous pledges to gradually reduce taxes on soybeans and their products. Under a series of changes, effective from September 3rd until the end of 2020, the soybean export tax has been raised to 28.5% (from 25.5% previously), with levies on soybean oil and meal raised to 25.8% (from 23%). The taxes had previously been scheduled to be reduced by 0.5% per month until the end of 2019. The announcement came just a few weeks before the start of the 2018/19 planting season, due to get under way in central parts in October.
Local prices are currently very supportive, and despite the changes in the tax regime it appears likely that soybeans may be a less risky proposition than maize for many growers. Financing costs for soybeans are comparatively lower, and with the prime interest rate now at 60%, farmers may be more incentivised to plant soybeans, especially given the potential for increased buying from China. With our numbers subject to revision but unchanged from the previous report, area is forecast to increase by about 2% in 2018/19. Should yields revert to normal, production is forecast to rebound sharply, to around 54m tonnes in 2018/19, up by more than 50% from the very poor results of the preceding season.
Uruguay is a relatively small player among South America's soybean producers. In the 2017/18 season production is estimated to have contracted significantly, to less than 2m tonnes (from 3.3m tonnes in the previous season), owing to the impact of harsh climatic conditions. As in Argentina, growers grappled with hot and dry weather in early 2018, and since this is the time when crops are setting pods, this resulted in area losses and a heavy reduction in yield potential. In some cases there were reports of average productivity being as low as 0.5 tonnes/ha. Subsequently growers had to contend with excessive rains. As a result the government has declared a national agricultural emergency and activated a fund to assist the worst-affected producers.
Most of Uruguay's supplies are exported to China
Since domestic consumption of soybeans in Uruguay is marginal, the bulk of the country's crop is exported, with China by far the largest market. Other destinations include Europe and Argentina, as well as North Africa and the US. Prospects for 2018/19 are uncertain at this early stage, as the seeding campaign is months away. However, based on average productivity and an area of 1.2m ha, output may recover to 3m tonnes.
Paraguay is a small but important exporter
Paraguay is a modest but important exporter of soybeans to a range of world markets. Output has sometimes varied sharply from one season to the next but has generally trended up over the past decade. Despite increasing local consumption, this has resulted in bigger surpluses for export. Furthermore, the expansion of domestic soybean use as a result of increased processing reflects growing international demand for soybean products.
Exports will decline in 2019/20
In 2017/18 farmers in Paraguay planted 500,000 ha of zafrina soybeans, following on from 3.5m ha of the much more important primary (zafra) crop. However, with yields from the zafrina crop potentially below expectations, production in 2017/18 fell slightly year on year, to 9.9m tonnes. The EU is the main market for Paraguay, accounting for 30-40% of all shipments, while sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), mainly Russia, have risen strongly in response to rising local demand in the region. Elsewhere, markets in Latin America are also important. Based on the current pace of exports, mainly to Argentina, we now expect 2017/18 exports to reach a record high of 6.6m tonnes, up from 5.3m tonnes in the previous season. In the following year and in 2019/20 a tentative recovery in production is expected, but shipments may dip as Argentina's import demand falls back to normal levels.

Production in China is rising but lags behind demand
China is by far the world's largest importer but only a minor producer of soybeans. However, potential has been capped over the years by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, maize and rice. Nonetheless, the government is keen to boost production of oilseeds, particularly soybeans, at the expense of corn in north-eastern areas as part of a supply-side adjustment programme. To this end, Jilin and Heiliongjiang provinces issued orders in early 2018 to increase soybean planting with the promise of public financial support. Based on an area increase of about 14% year on year, production in China in 2018/19 is projected to reach a ten-year high of 15.5m tonnes, expanding by 8.4% before flattening in 2019/20. Nevertheless, this still meets only a small portion of overall domestic need, the bulk of which is served by imports channelled to the country's vast feed sector.
Stocks and prices
Following the previous season's exceptionally strong gains, global ending stocks are estimated to have remained fairly flat in 2017/18, at about 120m tonnes-the largest on record and equivalent to a stocks/use ratio of 36%. In 2018/19 the global soybean market is expected to tip back into surplus, led by increases in Argentina-assuming a much improved crop-and the US. Amid huge US supplies and more limited opportunities for export, US stocks are forecast to reach record levels, with the world total placed at 133m tonnes (6.5m tonnes higher than in our previous forecast). We expect only a fractional drawdown at the end of the 2019/20 marketing year.

Export quotations were subject to contrasting trends in the past month. Average prices dropped by a net 5% in the period since our last report, with weakness noted in the US, Brazil and in Argentina. Earlier gains in US prices were mostly undone in August, as previous worries about yield prospects were soothed by a period of much better weather and news of good results from local crop tours. With traders beginning to factor in potentially record-high production, fob quotations at Gulf ports began to weaken, dropping by a net 10% to around US$316/tonnes. Export prices in Brazil (Paranagua) were a touch lower, but maintained a US$60 premium over US quotations. With Argentina's exportable surplus having been dramatically reduced by the smallest outturn in about a decade, quotations there were largely nominal.
We expect the average third-quarter 2018 US Gulf export price to be significantly lower than in the previous quarter and the same period last year as a result of the US-China trade war. In 2018 overall we now expect prices to average US$365/tonne, down by 3.1% year on year and a multi-year low. Amid a rebound in global production expected in 2018/19, international prices will remain under pressure, with Gulf quotations expected to fall by a further 5.2% year on year in 2019.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand at a fairly modest rate of 1.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20 (years ending September 30th). Increasing global consumption will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are adopting the food and drink habits of developed countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift as a sweetener in food and beverages and a binding and preserving agent in processed foods.
However, heightened awareness of the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put a brake on consumption growth, amid consumer calls for the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in an increasing number of markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products. These taxes have the potential to suppress sugar demand, although their impact will vary according to the level of taxation, the rigour of implementation and the elasticity of consumer demand. In addition, the growing supply of cheaper, starch-based alternative sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (where the market was liberalised in September 2017) will limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
China will remain a key consumer, but growth is set to moderate
Demand in China is forecast to expand more rapidly than the global average, but the pace of demand growth will begin to moderate (to 2.2% in 2018/19 and 2.1% in 2019/20) as the market matures. We expect private consumption in China to soften over the coming years, owing largely to issues in the property markets, but this pressure on real disposable income is likely to strengthen demand for cheaper food and drink products, many of which rely on sugar as a preservative. This will spur demand for industrial sugar. However, consumption growth will also be held back by the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners and rising concerns among wealthier consumers about the health implications of excess sugar in diets.
Import demand will be constrained by higher domestic output and the government's protectionist policy agenda. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government reduced import permits in mid-2017 to 1m tonnes/year (t/y), roughly half the previous level, and raised duties on some out-of-quota sugar imports from 50% to 95% in May 2017. Initially these tariffs applied only to imports from the largest global producers, but the rules were amended in August to apply 90% duty to all out-of-quota imports. Sugar imports have fallen to multi-year lows, and even assuming China grants some tariff exemptions (as seems likely), weak import demand is likely to prevail through 2019-20. However, China will be unable to scale up domestic production anytime soon to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high levels of stocks. It will therefore continue to make purchases overseas, and with prices higher in China than the global norm, it will remain an attractive export destination.
Urbanisation and income growth will drive Indian consumption
Demand in India is forecast to reach 26m tonnes in 2019/20, driven by fairly rapid urbanisation and steady income growth. The subdued price environment will also support demand, with local prices sinking since mid-2017 as the high domestic output hit the market. Amid pressure from producers to support prices the government has hiked import duties, imposed stockholding limits on mills and approved plans to create a buffer stock of some 3m tonnes. These measures, coupled with a recovery of demand among bulk consumers during the festive season, lifted domestic prices in the third quarter of 2018. Even so, large domestic stockpiles will place a firm lid on prices in 2018/19-2019/20, signalling that weak prices will continue to support demand.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is mixed. Demand growth in the more developed countries (such as Malaysia and South Korea) is expected to slow, but rising income in populous developing countries (such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam) will offset this. However, even in these developing countries demand will be tempered somewhat by concerns over the health impact of excessive sugar in diets. Policy measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines will soften demand growth, with sugar taxes now in place in Thailand and the Philippines. Several other Asian countries are considering similar moves, and the prospect of a tax hike will limit investment in sugar-reliant food- and drink-manufacturing industries. Sugar demand will be further dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry towards cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer of such sweeteners) seeks export markets. In light of these pressures, we expect demand growth in Asia (excluding China and India) to moderate to an average of 1.7% in 2018/19-2019/20, down from average growth of 2.5% over the previous five years.
Health warnings may eventually dent developed-world demand
The liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farm-gate prices and export caps were abolished-has limited the need for imports and brought European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. Although lower prices should support demand, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based alternative to sugar) was also liberalised in 2017, and this is likely to gradually steal market share in the sweetener industry. Indeed, Europe's largest beet producer, Germany's Südzucker, has announced plans to start making a sweetener with a lower sugar content.
Health concerns are spurring this shift away from sugar. In many EU countries average consumption levels of sugar are already far higher than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In an effort to tackle this, in April the UK introduced a tax on sugary drinks, and the French government intends to hike its so-called soda tax in 2018. The WHO scrapped its non-binding recommendation to impose a sugar tax in May, calling instead on governments to improve labelling and regulate the marketing of sugary products. Regardless of policy interventions, we expect consumer pressure to make manufacturers wary of using excess sugar in their products, which will reduce demand growth in the medium term. We therefore expect sugar demand to remain broadly flat in 2018/19-2019/20, despite low prices and population growth.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase on the back of population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation. Several countries (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. However, inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and most will be unable to compete with the cheap imports from an oversupplied global market. Aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa will therefore remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. A sugar tax came into effect in South Africa in April 2018, but amid pressure from food and drink manufacturers it has been set at just 10%, and we doubt that it will have a significant impact on overall sugar demand.
Policy changes will shift global sugar trade dynamics
The overhaul in 2017 by the EU of its sugar policy will drive its emergence as a net exporter, although the impact of this on the global market will be delayed somewhat by a weak European harvest in 2017/18. Nevertheless, exporters in the EU will focus in 2018/19-2019/20 on capturing market share in European countries with a sugar deficit, which will crowd non-EU producers out of the European market. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hit hardest by this shift. Some smaller producers have increased their market share in China since the May 2017 tariff regime was introduced, but they are unlikely to retain this market under the new rules. Brazil, which was hardest hit by China's tougher import rules, has opened a consultation with the WTO to examine these rules, but any possible intervention by the international body is a long way off. However, several producers (notably India) are, hoping to negotiate tariff exemptions with China, which could shift the pattern of near-term trade flows. Elsewhere, trade patterns will be influenced by the liberalisation of sugar sales under the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which will probably cause less efficient producers (such as Vietnam) to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade in North America is likely to increase following a trade deal agreed by the US and Mexico in mid-2017.

Supply
After rapid global production growth of some 11.8% in 2017/18 we expect output to moderate slightly in 2018/19-2019/20, to 181.7m tonnes. This dip is driven by lower output from Brazil, where producers can respond to the low global sugar price environment by diverting cane to ethanol production. However, global supply will remain high by historical standards, with output in India, Thailand and Europe still hovering around all-time highs. This will keep the global market in surplus and sustain pressure on prices. Most of the world's sugar producers will therefore struggle to break even. Cane will be diverted to other industrial uses, notably ethanol production, where possible, but financial pressures will put some mills out of business over the coming years.
This correction will, however, be slow to take effect. Sugar is a multi-year crop, and the industry is characterised the long contracts. Taken together, this will delay the responsiveness of farmers to low cane demand. Moreover, increased cane acreage and greater access to high-yielding inputs will deliver another strong harvest in 2018/19-2019/20 in most markets. Government intervention (notably in India) will also keep unprofitable sugars mills in operation.
Trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by production levels in countries (notably India) that swing between being importers and exporters. The bulk of India's output is consumed domestically, but a strong harvest will lead to higher exports; much of this will probably go to emerging markets with costly local production. We therefore expect trade flows to average 59.9m tonnes in 2018/19-2019/20, above the 58.6m-tonne average over the previous five years. There is, however, a downside risk of further protectionism in the sugar industry as governments attempt to shield their local manufacturers from cheap imports, and this could act as a major weight on trade flows.
Output in Brazil will be determined by price dynamics
We expect sugar production in Brazil to decline to an average of 33.9m tonnes in 2018/19-2019/20. This is largely due to the diversion of cane to ethanol production, which is more profitable than sugar production in the current price environment. Indeed, since the local 2018/19 season began in April, Brazil has crushed more cane than in the previous year, but sugar production is down and ethanol production is on course for all-time highs.
However, ethanol production cannot absorb all of the country's cane supply, and domestic prices of the biofuel are already tumbling as demand fails to keep pace with surging supply. There is a risk that ethanol prices will drop below sugar prices, particularly if the newly elected government caps fuel prices, which would prompt producers to switch back to sugar and sell more supplies into the saturated global market. However, this is not our central forecast, as we expect oil prices to remain relatively high (thereby boosting demand for ethanol in Brazil) and the depreciation of the Real to be fairly modest (thereby failing to provide a significant incentive for dollar-denominated sugar exports). Moreover, even if the ethanol/sugar price dynamic does change, sugar output will be limited by low investment in aging cane fields. The profitability of soy crops in Brazil is also prompting farmers in the sugarcane belt to switch crops wherever possible, and although long-term contracts and multi-year crops will delay this crop rotation, a resurgence in Brazilian production seems unlikely.
A strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
After a record-high output in 2017/18 we expect output in India to remain high in 2018/19-2019/20 at an average of 33.9m tonnes/year, as cane supply remains plentiful and efforts to build other cane-dependant industries (notably ethanol production) are slow to take off. However, producers are unable to break even in the current price environment, and millers' arrears to farmers are estimated to have reached some US$3.5bn. The government has provided a bail-out package to millers, but this covers just 40% of existing arrears. Some casualties (particularly among the most debt-ridden mills) are likely, and the government will remain under political pressure from both millers and farmers to intervene.
Policies designed to restore balance in the local industry include removing export duties, setting a price floor for domestic sugar prices, subsidising a portion of millers' contracts with farmers and subsiding loans to increase ethanol production capacity. These measures are yet to have much impact on the level of oversupply or prices, however. The government is attempting to find new export markets, but low global prices mean that producers will still struggle to break even. The government is also considering indirect export subsidies via cane growers, but any such moves will face resistance from Brazil and Australia via the WTO. With the government in effect subsidising an oversupplied and unprofitable domestic market, it will eventually have to allow some producers to fail. Political expediency and a general election in 2019 (in which the government will be seeking the support of farmers) make it unlikely this will happen anytime soon, though.
Brisk EU production growth following sectoral liberalisation
Production in Europe is forecast to average 19.7 tonnes/year in 2018/19 and 2019/20. This follows a record-high year of production in 2017/18 of 21m tonnes as producers sought to take advantage of the lifting the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system at the start of the season. Under the new regime producers (led by France and Germany) extended their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity, and increased the acreage under plantation. These factors will support production over the coming years. However, output in 2018/19 will be hit by the heavy rains, which delayed springtime planting, and the hot summer months in key producing countries, which will reduce sugar yields. However, the impact of recent weather patterns is somewhat uncertain, given the varying crop conditions in Europe.
More fundamentally, European producers are struggling to break even in the current price environment, with Südzucker reporting a 49% drop in profits in the first quarter of 2018. Weak global prices, coupled with the fact that the liberalisation of the sugar industry has removed the premium at which European sugar was previously traded, will place a firm brake on investment in the sugar industry over the coming years.
In Russia, production will continue to benefit from the significant investments that have been made in modernising sugar factories in recent years. After favourable growing conditions in 2017/18 led to record-high production, though, both cane acreage and yields are expected to be lower in 2018/19-2019/20. Production will continue to exceed domestic consumption, but soft demand in Central Asia (Russia's main market) will lessen its export potential.
Output in Thailand is recovering but pressures are mounting
Thai sugar production is surging as both crop acreage and yields exceed the long-run averages. After reaching a record-high of 13.8m tonnes in 2017/18, we expect output to edge up further in 2018/19-2019/20, driven by more planting. Output growth will, however, be somewhat constrained by the increased diversion of cane to ethanol production. This diversion reflects limited export opportunities in an oversupplied global market and mounting price pressures in the local sugar industry. The local industry was formally liberalised in early 2018, after Brazil successfully argued that Thailand was violating WTO rules on free competition. Quotas for sugar production will therefore be phased out, and the domestic price-fixing system will be revoked, but mills are still obliged to reimburse farmers if the final sale price drops below a pre-agreed level. This protects farmers from global volatility, but with global prices at their current lows, mills are struggling to turn a profit. This will lead to some consolidation in the industry. Moreover, weather-related risks are rising as farming moves towards more drought-prone interior regions.
China's output will rise but will still fall short of government targets
After falling sharply in 2013/14-2016/17 owing to adverse weather conditions and the impact of rapidly rising costs of labour, land and farm machinery, China's sugar output has begun to recover. We expect this trend to continue, with output rising to 10.7m tonnes in 2019/20 on the back of normal weather conditions and some government support. However, producers will face price pressures. Production costs have increased, driven by higher prices for fertiliser and pesticides, and prices have come under pressure from a rebound in local output and global oversupply. The government has been quick to intervene to protect local producers by hiking import duties, and this should provide some support to prices in 2018/19-2019/20. Even so, prices will remain too low to spur much investment in the sector. In addition, the sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high, and sugarcane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. We therefore expect that China will fall far short of achieving the 10% annual supply growth that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals.

Stocks and prices
Global sugar stocks increased to an estimated 101m at end-2017/18 on the back of a large market surplus. We expect this surplus to decline, from 13.6m tonnes in 2017/18 to 3.5m tonnes in 2019/20 as modest consumption growth is matched by a slight drop in output. Even so, these dynamics will not be significant enough to bring the market back into balance, and successive years of global surpluses will lift stocks. We therefore expect global stocks to reach 112.9m tonnes in 2019/20, equivalent to over 63% of consumption.

A prolonged global surplus will sustain the pressure on prices
Significant oversupply in the sugar industry is piling pressure on prices. Global sugar prices fell to an average of 16 US cents/lb in 2017, down by 11.3% year on year and more than 30% lower than the 2016 peak of 23 US cents/lb. Prices have remained under pressure through the course of 2018, dropping to a multi-year low of 10.75 US cents/lb in August. Uncertainty over the impact of recent weather conditions on the European crop has provided some support to prices in the first half of September, but the modest price rebound is unlikely to be sustained. Indeed, traders are still positioning for further losses, with total short positions within 3% of the all-time record that was reached in May.
Brazil is the only producer able to act as a shock absorber, given millers' ability to divert significant cane supply to ethanol production when prices drop. However, owing to Brazil's falling market share this is insufficient to raise prices, and the link between ethanol/sugar price parity has become less significant globally as a floor on sugar prices. As a result, prices are forecast to remain under considerable pressure in the coming months. Far-reaching policy interventions by Asian governments are also likely to keep unprofitable producers in the market and delay a market correction. Hence, we have revised down our forecast to a yearly average of 11.8 US$ cent/lb in 2018 and pushed back the point at which prices will begin to recover.
We expect prices to drift slowly higher from mid-2019. This will be driven in part by the sugar-trading market pricing in more risk, particularly as regions highly exposed to weather shocks gain prominence in global supply. More fundamentally, the market will gradually tighten over the medium term as costlier producers are forced out of the market. With traders taking their price cues from markets some two years ahead, this will provide some support to prices.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Global sunflowerseed oil consumption growth was always likely to slow in 2017/18, following record year-on-year growth of 15% in 2016/17. Nonetheless, consumption continues to outperform The Economist Intelligence Unit's expectations. Although the increases to our consumption estimates for 2017/18 are small, a 3.4% increase on 2016/17 is a good performance. With sunflowerseed oil becoming more competitive again, this momentum is now more likely to be maintained into the 2018/19 season, and we expect consumption to expand by a further 3.4% to reach 19.5m tonnes. The 20m-tonne barrier is likely to be breached in 2019/20.
Improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
The price discount of sunflowerseed oil to other oils continues at historically high levels. Consumption in the EU remains buoyant, with a further increase in our 2017/18 consumption estimate to 4.8m tonnes (previously 4.7m tonnes). In 2018/19, however, consumption may be constrained by local availability, although rising global production estimates mean that imports could fill any gap. At this stage we expect only a modest 1.6% increase in consumption to just under 5m tonnes. Trends in soybean oil prices, following US-China trade tariff changes, are likely to have a strong influence on sunflowerseed consumption levels.
Russian consumption set to rise in 2018/19 with higher local output
A strong export market for Russian sunflowerseed oil has had a limiting impact on consumption by bolstering domestic prices. Our estimate of 2017/18 consumption is virtually unchanged, at 2.4m tonnes. We expect consumption growth to resume in 2018/19, supported by higher domestic production and continued GDP growth. However, changes to trans-fat regulations may discourage the use of sunflowerseed oil in the margarine sector. We currently expect 2018/19 consumption to approach 2.5m tonnes, representing growth of more than 3%.
Transshipment into India increases
India's previously robust pace of sunflowerseed imports began to slow in early 2018, reflecting the imposition of higher import tariffs. However, import levels have since risen again. In part this is attributable to a loophole in India's import tariff arrangements, which allow duty-free imports via countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Transshipment of oils through these locations is reported to be rising. Our estimate of 2017/18 consumption is increased to 2.5m tonnes. The impact of the higher tariff rates on 2018/19 consumption will depend on the extent to which the transshipment trade continues to develop. At present, we maintain our forecast for relatively modest growth of 2%.
Consumption growth to moderate in "other" countries in 2017/18
Many countries, including Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt as well as several other smaller states, increased their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Their imports have now slowed, and total consumption of these "other" countries in 2017/18 is likely to remain at very similar levels to 2016/17. With sunflowerseed oil production expected to increase, consumption in these other countries is expected to resume its upward trend in 2018/19 and 2019/20. There are also reports of Chinese buyers showing increasing interest in sunflowerseed oil.

Supply
Although global sunflowerseed oil production in 2017/18 is expected to fall short of the record 2016/17 output, it will still remain an above-average performance. Our estimates of production in individual countries show small increases in all the major producers with the exception of Argentina. With northern hemisphere harvesting now well under way, 2018/19 sunflowerseed production looks set to establish a new record. Output growth continues in Russia and Ukraine, and the EU crop is also large by recent standards. There is a need to rebuild sunflowerseed stock levels, but sunflowerseed oil production should still comfortably exceed 19m tonnes in 2018/19.
Crush rates improve slightly
Following a mid-season slowdown, crushing activity in Ukraine continues to run marginally above expectations following an improved export outlook for sunflowerseed oil. We have again increased our estimate of 2017/18 sunflowerseed production. Output will remain below last season's total but will still be the second-highest total ever achieved, reflecting the high base of comparison in 2016/17. The sunflowerseed area for 2018/19 is 3% larger than in 2017/18, despite earlier concerns that falling profit margins would act as a disincentive to farmers. Harvesting has now started, although only a small area has been cut so far. At this early stage field reports suggest that yields have been above earlier expectations and above 2017/18 levels. We have raised our crop forecast to 10% above the 2017/18 outturn. This should ensure sufficient raw material to boost sunflowerseed oil output to 6.2m tonnes, more than 9% higher than in 2017/8 but still below 2016/17 levels.
Russia's 2018-19 crop could be constrained by dry conditions
In Russia, crush rates continue to be consistent with our estimate of just above 4.5m tonnes of sunflowerseed oil production in 2017/18. With harvesting just getting under way, most projections put the crop in the 11.5m-12m tonne range; the previous high was 11.6m tonnes in 2016/17. At this stage we have retained our forecast of 2018/19 sunflowerseed oil output of just over 4.7m tonnes. This would represent relatively modest growth of 3.4% but would still constitute a new record high, exceeding the 2016/17 level.
The outlook for the 2017/18 EU sunflowerseed crop remains firm
The record 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop and high carry-in stocks have supported substantial growth in EU sunflowerseed oil production. Production is estimated at 3.7m tonnes in 2017/18-easily a new record and more than 12% above the 2016/17 output. While sowings for 2018/19 are virtually unchanged, weather conditions have largely been favourable in the important growing regions in south-east and south-central Europe. Crop estimates are tending to rise, with some assessments putting the outturn above 10m tonnes, which would be a new record. We expect EU sunflowerseed oil production in 2018/19 to be only marginally lower than in 2017/18. If the higher crop estimates are realised, sunflowerseed oil production could also set a new record.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain positive
Recent data suggests that 2017/18 Argentinean sunflowerseed production will not meet our earlier expectations. Our new forecast of the likely outturn is now 1.3m tonnes (as against 1.4m tonnes previously). We continue to expect the planted area to expand in 2018/19, especially given reported difficulties in planting other crops. However, recent weather has not been favourable for crop development, with conditions too dry in many important growing regions. The critical yield-determining period has not yet been reached, but we have made a small reduction in our harvest forecast. On this basis we expect 2018/19 sunflowerseed oil production to reach 1.5m tonnes (almost 12% higher than the previous season), provided export markets can be found.

Stocks and prices
Although global sunflowerseed stocks at end-2017/18 will be plentiful, they will be lower than at the end of the 2016/17 season, when they were at very low levels. This means that 2017/18 sunflowerseed oil output will rely very heavily on the sunflowerseed harvest. Current projections suggest that the 2018/19 season will be sufficiently strong to support an increase in seed stocks, and consequently rising sunflowerseed oil consumption. Sunflowerseed oil stocks will fall during 2018/19 but should end the season at levels above recent averages.

Upward pressure on prices is likely to be felt from mid-2019 onward
Sunflowerseed oil was the weakest of the major vegetable oils during August, with prices falling by almost US$40/tonne. Sunflowerseed oil continues to trade at significant discounts to both rapeseed oil and soybean oil. With comfortable production and stock levels, we expect that prices will tend to be easier over the 2018/19 season as a whole. While price falls will be limited by the prices of rapeseed and soybean oils, overall sunflowerseed prices are expected to remain below US$750/tonne for much of the season. Early projections suggest that 2019/20 might see below-normal stocks of sunflowerseed oil, and prices could start to edge up towards the end of 2019 and beyond.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for nearly 40% of world tea consumption and is drinking ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is growing in other major consuming regions as well, including India, which has offset weaker growth in demand in Europe. Despite press coverage of strengthening consumer demand for high-end luxury tea as well as iced tea, this accounts for only a tiny share of the market, with lower-cost varieties continuing to dominate. As such, demand for tea will remain less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities, meaning that tea demand will remain driven principally by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast for tea consumption growth, of 4.6% a year on average in 2019-20, is relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since consumption of tea is driven by structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages.
Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, driven in particular by its increasing popularity in China, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and other ready-to-drink tea beverages account for a small share of the market but have seen rapid growth in sales-notably in the US, but also in traditional markets such as China.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are also the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption, partly reflecting domestic marketing campaigns by various tea boards to promote tea-drinking. The premise behind these efforts is that higher domestic consumption will incentivise producers to lift output in order to raise exports. In producing countries tea will also benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places it will continue to remain a consumer staple. Combined with favourable demographics, consumption growth in producing countries is therefore likely to rise further. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partly to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2019-20
Tea consumption will continue to be dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2018, up from 48% in 2010. In China, where growth in tea consumption has averaged over 10% per year in the past decade, we expect tea demand to continue to rise firmly, albeit by a more moderate average of 6.9% per year in 2019-20. Despite this strong growth projection risks to our forecast are primarily to the upside; average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China 14th in the world. This leaves room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drinks tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting competition from coffee and soft-drinks retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 26% per year since 2008, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Although ready-to-drink products are gaining market share, particularly in cities, the importance attached to the quality of tea means that sales of loose-leaf tea will continue to dominate the local market.
UN data also show a sharp increase in India's tea consumption, to 1.05m tonnes in 2016, accounting for 19% of global tea demand. We estimate that consumption rose by a further 5% in 2017, before accelerating to 6% in 2018. In 2019-20 we expect strong economic growth to be accompanied by higher household spending, firm consumer confidence and supportive demographics, driving annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2019-20. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share and fuel overall tea consumption growth.
Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2019-20 by market saturation and weakening demographics. Despite a firmer economic performance the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecasts overall stagnation until 2027 in European markets (which together account for 4% of global consumption) as well as in Russia, which accounts for 2.5% of global consumption and is the world's largest tea importer. Turkey, which accounts for around 4% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest per-capita levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting population growth and in many markets ongoing (if weaker) growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. In 2019-20 we forecast average annual demand growth of 1.2% in the EU and just 0.1% in Turkey, reflecting underlying economic difficulties in the latter. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.7% per year in 2019-20, but this is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consumption in recent years.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for an estimated 2.4% of global consumption in 2018, and per-capita consumption is relatively low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea, with the latter accounting for 85% of the country's total tea consumption. It also remains one of the world's largest tea importers. We expect demand to increase by 3% in 2019, before weaker underlying economic conditions in 2020 prompt a deceleration to 0.9% that year. In the medium term we expect relatively firm demand for tea, with a continued shift away from carbonated drinks towards other beverages.

Supply
Although tea production has recovered in 2018 in both Kenya and China, following a poor outturn in 2017, production has dropped in India. We estimate that this will cause global tea production growth to moderate to 2.7%. We expect global production growth to accelerate in 2019-20, to around 3% per year. Nonetheless, this remains below the long-running average of 4.5% growth per year in 2006-16, with several structural factors preventing faster production growth during the forecast period. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades owing to the higher cost of inputs, which will weigh on investment. In some cases, falling real earnings mean that smallholders' incomes place them within international and national measures of poverty. Investment will also be hampered by overall market perceptions that prospects for longer-term global consumption growth are weaker than those for some other, more fashionable beverages such as coffee, despite the fact that global tea consumption growth will remain fairly strong. In addition, many local currencies will remain weak against the US dollar in 2019-20, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers.
Much of the forecast growth in 2019-20 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects rising production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, up from 43% a decade ago. We expect these trends to continue in 2019-20.
Structural efforts in China to bolster tea production
China's tea production rose by an estimated 3.5% in 2017 after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China mid-year, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which is likely to have hampered production. On the back of more supportive weather conditions, we estimate that tea production growth recovered to 5% in 2018. However, we are forecasting a deceleration in 2019-20, reflecting broader government efforts to improve the enforcement of environmental regulations, with local authorities destroying illegally planted tea bushes. Although we do not believe that these efforts will escalate to a level that would lead to a decline in tea production, it will take the edge of what had previously been extremely strong levels of tea production growth, at an average of 9.1% per year in 2004-16. Despite the tighter enforcement of environmental regulations, the government will still seek to foster increased agricultural productivity. A focus on eliminating rural poverty is likely to be accompanied by continued efforts to improve farmers' access to credit from the Agricultural Development Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit co-operatives.
Official efforts to promote innovation, increase the use of technology and lift quality standards will also help to spur production, and better availability and quality should boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Germany and the US are China's main tea export markets; although trade relations with the US have deteriorated in recent months, tea has not been included in the list of items attracting US import tariffs. We believe that there is potential for gains in productivity, which would also increase long-term tea output growth, since China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 801 kg/ha in 2014-16, compared with 2,153 kg/ha in India and 2,088 kg/ha in Kenya).
India's tea production will grow slowly in 2019-20
After rising by 0.9% in 2017, tea production in India has been disappointing in 2018. Output fell by 5.1% in the first seven months of the year, according to the Tea Board, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state) as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India. We estimate a 4% drop in tea production in the full calendar year. In 2019-20 we forecast that output will recover gradually, rising by an average of 2.9% per year. Efforts to channel funding to tea growers and to introduce an insurance scheme for smallholders (who account for 50% of production) to protect against falls in market prices and weather-related crop disruption will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back firmer growth in production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment (FDI) in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly, and rising input costs have eroded profits; labour now accounts for 50% of production costs (a figure that has grown by 12% in the past three years). As a result, India will struggle to raise output as significantly as other major producers in the long term. With several tea manufacturers reporting losses in India (the world's largest firm, McLeod Russel, made losses in India compared with profits in Uganda, Vietnam and Rwanda), it is unclear how much FDI the sector will attract.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
Tea production in Sri Lanka bounced back strongly after landslides and severe flooding in May 2017, with full-year production actually rising by 4.1%, despite alarmist warnings of a collapse in output following the heavy rains. In 2018 favourable weather early in the year has been followed by more adverse conditions in recent months, with tea production stagnating in January-July compared with the year-earlier period. We have downgraded our full-year estimate and now expect an increase of just 1%, compared with 4.2% previously. The government's decision to lift a ban on the use of glyphosate weed killer (used by all major tea producers) in tea plantations will provide some support in the near term, since there had been speculation that some key export markets (notably Japan) would cut imports from Sri Lanka on the basis that farmers had resorted to using a replacement chemical, MCPA, which is more stringently regulated in Japan.
However, there are several structural hurdles that will restrict the pace of growth in the medium term. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not high enough to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. Local reports also show that fertiliser use has been low, and the risk of industrial unrest persists. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. Reflecting these factors, we forecast a weaker rate of tea production growth, of 1.6% in 2019-20.
Continued production growth in Kenya is likely in 2019-20
After poor weather conditions in the first three quarters of 2017 led to a full-year decline in production of over 7.4%, tea production is showing solid signs of recovery so far in 2018, with output in January-June rising by 14% year on year. As such, we estimate a record output of 500,000 tonnes this year. In 2019-20 we expect only modest production growth, averaging 2.5% per year, as periodic industrial action over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers-which is now based on the value rather than the volume of sales-undermines profitability and prevents faster growth. The government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, but conflicting interests and a lack of funds will also hinder progress.
Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Other smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes 3-5 years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact of recent price falls on output will be evident only after the forecast period.

Stocks and prices
With consumption growth expected to outstrip production growth in 2019-20, the market balance is expected to fall from an estimated surplus of 13,000 tonnes in 2018 to a deficit of 172,000 tonnes in 2020. Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge the degree to which these movements will affect actual physical stock levels. Stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output (mainly of green tea) in China. Although some of the annual production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.
Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya, respectively (essentially black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. For example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have fallen so far in 2018 as production in Sri Lanka and Kenya have risen, while prices at the Kolkata auction have fallen as Indian output has declined.

Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes. There is currently no futures market, although the latest meeting of the FAO Intergovernmental Group (IGG) on Tea, which took place in May, discussed the feasibility of introducing one in an effort to address price volatility and differentials between individual tea auctions. However, given that the IGG meets fairly sporadically (usually once a year), we do not expect the introduction of a futures market within the forecast period. Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat in 2019 before recovering slightly in 2020
Average tea prices fell from US$3.17/kg in the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$2.96/kg in the second quarter of 2018, with prices stabilising around that level since then. We expect prices to rebound modestly in the third quarter; however, this will be not be sufficent to prevent a drop in average prices over the full year, as we expect prices to weaken again the fourth quarter. We forecast that average prices will fall further in 2019, to an annual average of US$2.81/kg, before picking up to US$2.90/kg in 2020 as demand remains relatively firm, outpacing production growth.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has nearly tripled since the 1960s, to more than 730m tonnes in recent years. However, gains in demand, mainly for food and milling purposes, have failed to keep pace with increases in production, resulting in a five-year period of stock accumulation between 2013/14 and 2017/18 (local marketing years). Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been driven by a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has generally outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global wheat consumption to increase only fractionally in 2018/19, by 0.5% year on year to 738m tonnes, as gains in consumption for food only partially compensate for an expected drop in use for animal feed. Initial projections for 2019/20 remain highly tentative at this stage. Assuming larger crops and renewed growth in the use of wheat as an animal feed, total consumption is projected to rise by 1.9%, to 752m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in global wheat consumption for food use has remained relatively consistent over the past decade. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods, such as noodles and Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports in most years. We expect the global use of wheat for food to rise by 1.3% in 2018/19. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
World livestock feed use is expected to drop in 2018/19
Wheat is the world's second-most important grain for use in animal feed, with annual consumption roughly equal to the feed use of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. Wheat usage is typically equivalent to one-quarter of the amount of maize that goes into animal feed each year. Given shrinking supplies and continued strong competition from maize-especially in the EU and US-we expect feed use of wheat to drop below recent peaks to a five-year low of 133m tonnes. Demand will depend on relative pricing and overall levels of quality. Following huge crop losses across northern Europe, feed-wheat supplies are expected to be much tighter in 2018/19, and demand will potentially need to be rationed. Feed-wheat use in the EU, which accounts for around 40% of the world total, is currently predicted to drop by around 6m tonnes in 2018/19 to around 48m tonnes as users switch to more competitively priced alternatives, mainly imported maize. Strong export demand for barley may limit how much of that grain is fed domestically in the coming season. However, given this season's very short pasture and grazing availabilities, prospects for the EU feed-grain market outlook are still quite uncertain, and much will depend on how price relationships develop over the coming months. Feed-wheat use in South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam could also decline. However, feed use of wheat in China is expected to rise as more sub-standard domestic supplies are diverted into feed mills in the main southern meat-consuming hubs.
A large harvest is expected to contain Morocco's import needs
Wheat is a staple food in Morocco, where per-capita consumption has long been among the highest in the world, estimated at 216 kg annually in recent years. As domestic production is highly dependent on seasonal rainfall, there are occasionally huge swings in output from one year to the next. This was particularly evident just a few seasons ago, when a record crop of 8.1m tonnes in 2015/16 was followed by an outturn of just 2.7m tonnes in 2016/17. With annual domestic needs close to 9.5m tonnes, Morocco is a major buyer on the global market, importing an average of 4.3m tonnes per year, mainly from the EU, the Black Sea region and Canada. After an unusually dry start to the 2018/19 winter wheat planting season, which prevented some farmers from sowing the intended area, abundant rains in recent months have greatly revived crop prospects, and production should be on track to match last season's 7.1m tonnes, including 4.8m tonnes of soft milling wheat and 2.3m tonnes of durum. As part of efforts to contain third-country arrivals, the Ministry of Agriculture announced in early May 2018 that import duties on common wheat would be hiked to 135% (from 35%) until the end of October 2018.
China has imposed 25% tariffs on US-origin wheat imports
Following the souring of the US-China trade relationship in recent months, a number of US agricultural products, including wheat, are now subject to an additional 25% duty on imports into China. With purchases mainly linked to quality shortfalls in its own huge domestic crop and capped by a restrictive licensing system, China is usually not an overly large importer of wheat. Annual imports have recently averaged 4.1m tonnes per year, with the US typically maintaining a 32% share. Buying interest has almost completely dried up in recent months, mainly reflecting price considerations, but with some importers also reportedly wary of the risk of additional checks or holdups when sourcing US wheat. Instead, local buyers have so far looked to secure additional supplies from Russia and Kazakhstan. We expect Chinese demand to recover in 2018/19-2019/20 by 2.1%, after an estimated decline of 1.3% in 2017/18.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, with output climbing to successive highs in each of the past five years. Part of this upswing is linked to a small overall rise in plantings, with harvested area trending marginally higher, but much of this has been tied to better average yields, seen close to 3.5 tonnes/ha in 2017/18, compared with 2.8 tonnes/ha a decade ago. Despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat-seed technology, productivity gains have been achieved almost everywhere as farmers employ ever more advanced agronomic practices. However, following extended periods of adverse weather across many key producers and exporters, world output in 2018/19 is projected at 715m tonnes, down 5.7% from 2017/18 and potentially the smallest crop since 2010/11. Despite an earlier build-up of stocks, the sheer scale of the drop in production, combined with a solid demand base, has quickly shrunk exportable availabilities. Prices have begun to rise, especially in Europe, with US supplies gradually turning more competitive. Assuming more normal weather conditions, world production is expected to rebound by 4.9% in 2019/20, with output pegged at 750m tonnes.
A drop in 2018/19 plantings and yields will cause EU production to decline
Cumulative production in the EU is forecast to slump by 10.7% in 2018/19, the smallest total in in six seasons. This reflects downgrades in expected yields in northern Europe, the Baltics and Scandinavia. The winter wheat harvest in Germany, typically the bloc's second-largest grower, was finished much earlier than normal. Due to a damaging drought, average yields are down by one-quarter compared with the five-year average, with production seen dropping to only around 18.5m tonnes, compared with 24.2m tonnes in 2017/18. Similarly bad conditions have been reported in Poland, normally the EU's third-largest wheat exporter. Amid exceptionally hot weather in recent months, even sharper declines in yields are expected in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Harvesting in France, by some distance the EU's largest grower and exporter, was finished by early August. While production is expected to fall slightly short of the average, cropping weather was generally more favourable than in more northern states, and output is expected to fall by only around 8%, to some 36m tonnes. The production shortfall is expected to limit exportable supplies in the 2018/19 marketing year severely, with exports potentially seen falling to just 21m tonnes, down 6% from last season and perhaps the lowest level since 2011/12.We expect the situation to improve in 2019/20, when overall EU output is forecast to grow by 9.6%, still around 3m tonnes less than the 2017/18 level.
Russia's output will decline by almost 20% in 2018/19
The outlook for Russia has also deteriorated. While the 2018/19 crop is still on course to be similar to the recent average, it will fall well short of the previous year's record. The harvest is now expanding into Siberia. Spring wheat yields in that region are typically low, and while some operators have reported positive results, so far crops were planted very late in some areas. This implies that here is a risk of greater than normal levels of abandonment, especially if winter conditions arrive early. Based on latest harvest updates, it appears that recent cuts to our production forecasts might have been overly harsh, with total output now seen at close to 68m tonnes (66m tonnes previously), broadly similar to the recent average but down sharply from last year's enormous crop of 84.9m tonnes. This will mark a contraction of almost 20% in 2018/19, before output rebounds by 5.9% in 2019/20. Winter grains sowing for harvest in 2019 has started in parts of southern Russia, where soil moisture deficiencies have been reported.
Speculation about possible export controls has gained traction in recent weeks, amid meetings between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Association of Exporters of Agricultural Products (NAESP). While there remains some disagreement about exactly what was discussed at these meetings-with some observers pointing out some subtle differences between Russian and English-language statements-it is clear that authorities are monitoring the situation closely. Local feed manufacturers are said to be particularly concerned about tightening local supplies and rising prices. There have been some indications that grain exports could be capped at 30m tonnes, including 25m tonnes of wheat; based on the current very strong pace of shipments, this level could potentially be reached as soon as January 2019. This year's early harvest has quickly replenished exportable pipelines, and with a much weaker rouble inflating exporter returns, 2018/19 (July-June marketing year) shipments have started very rapidly. The threat of export controls has also spurred additional sales as exporters look to maximise shipments ahead of possible restrictions later in 2018.
Average yields in Ukraine are likely to drop
Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture announced in August that it had reached an agreement with exporters to ship 16m tonnes of wheat in 2018/19 (July/June), including up to 8m tonnes of milling varieties. These Memorandums of Understanding are signed each season and are used as an informal mechanism of ensuring adequate domestic supplies. In some press reports and across social media the deal was instead reported as a formal limit on exports. With markets already nervous about shrinking exportable wheat availabilities, prices quickly spiked higher before dropping again on official confirmation that exports were not being restricted. The 2018/19 winter harvest is now complete and is forecast at around 25.4m tonnes; this is almost 6% down compared with 2017/18 levels, with an increase in acreage more than offset by a drop in average yields. Final quality evaluations are still ongoing, but it seems likely that a smaller percentage of this year's crop will meet milling specifications.
Chinese output to drop in 2018/19
As part of ongoing agricultural market reforms and with a view to capping centrally held stockpiles, China's government recently outlined some further adjustments of its minimum support price programme for 2018/19. After lowering the support price late last year, the authorities announced that purchases of standard (3rd class) wheat between June 1st and September 30th will only be made once the government has confirmed that the average market price has fallen below the minimum price for three successive days. While tinkering with foodgrain price support measures remains a sensitive policy area, the current system has resulted in a sharp build-up of moderate-gluten wheat supplies and the need for costly stockpiling. More radical changes in policy can therefore be expected in the years ahead.
Based on latest production data by province, we expect Chinese output to decline by 5.6% in 2018/19-a five-year low of 122.5m tonnes. Excessive rains have badly affected yields and quality in parts of Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, where final results were even worse than previously anticipated. Local officials have reportedly been instructed to support affected farmers by procuring sub-standard wheat under the minimum support price programme. It is unclear how much wheat will be procured and exactly what it will be used for, but it is expected to be diverted into feed channels as long as mycotoxin specifications are met.
Spring wheat yields relatively disappointing in parts of Canada
With drier than normal weather affecting crops across the Canadian Prairies, the latest official survey-based production data included sharper than expected downgrades in yields for spring wheat and durum. Despite increases in area planted in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, average yields are expected to decline in all three provinces. Harvesting is making good progress overall, with operations already finished in Manitoba, where yields and quality are said to be higher than previously expected. Overall, however, we have reduced our production forecast for 2018/19 to 30m tonnes (from 31m tonnes previously), unchanged from 2017/18 levels. We expect conditions to improve, and the output to grow by 4% in 2019/20.

Argentina imposes an export tax on primary exports
Faced with deepening financial market woes, which include a massive depreciation in the value of the peso, soaring interest rates and rampant inflation, the Argentinean president recently unveiled new revenue-raising measures aimed at an accelerated loan agreement with the IMF. As part of this, the president has announced a reversal of his flagship commodity tax-cutting policies, applying a floating tax of 4 pesos per US dollar on primary exports, including agricultural products such as wheat, maize and soybeans. The policy, which is effective from September 4th until the end of 2020, is based on current calculations and basically places a 10.5% export tax on wheat. With the levy only recently announced, there is still uncertainty about whether previously declared export sales will be subject to the new arrangements. In the short term, farmers may hold back from selling dollar-denominated agricultural products by means of a hedge against currency movements, especially if foreign-exchange-market volatility continues. However, the announcement will have no bearing on 2018/19 wheat production, as plantings are already complete.
After an extremely favourable start to the cropping year, with soil moisture adequate almost everywhere, conditions have turned progressively drier. Rains have been particularly scarce in parts of Cordoba province and in the north of the country. However, local sources continue to report better conditions in core central producing areas. Because of expected strong returns, plantings increased by around 7% year on year. Farmers are also reported to have maximised fertiliser use, which should be supportive of yields. Forecast production is maintained at a record 20m tonnes, marking an increase of 8.1% in 2018/19. This trend will continue in 2019/20, and production is forecast to increase by an additional 5% in that year.
Stocks and prices
Following five consecutive increases, the world wheat carryover is forecast to contract by 8.6% by the end of 2018/19 to around 246m tonnes, still the second-highest ever and some 9% higher than the previous five-year average. Stockpiles in China are expected to grow even larger, seen rising by as much as 5% to 132m tonnes, equivalent to more than half of the global total. Since stocks there will only ever be used to satisfy local demand, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently announced that its supply-and-demand outlook would at some point in the future include such estimates. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to measure stocks in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supply. Cumulative stocks in these countries are expected to tighten by 23.4m tonnes to 58.1m tonnes, a 29% year-on-year decline. Exporter stocks are forecast to reach their tightest level in five seasons. A smaller exportable surplus and the need to ration demand away from feed channels are expected to provide a floor to prices going forward, especially in the event of further crop downgrades. Based on early projections for 2019/20 supply and demand, wheat ending stocks could decline again by the end of the following season by an additional 1%. However, exporter inventories are projected to be larger by 11% in that year.

An earlier slump in prices has been undone
World wheat markets have become more volatile in recent months. As the focus turned on increasingly tight wheat supply-and-demand fundamentals, average milling wheat prices rallied by around 15% between late June and mid-August. Despite expectations of much tighter availabilities in the season ahead, around half of these gains have since been reversed. This most recent downturn was linked to speculation that the gains had been overdone, especially given that no restrictions had yet been imposed on Russian exports. While prices have corrected somewhat, we would still argue that risks are on the upside. We expect that price direction in the coming months will largely be shaped by the final results from northern hemisphere harvests, and perhaps more particularly the exact size of Russia's 2018/19 surplus. Average prices are expected to strengthen in 2018, but assuming Russian shipments remain high in the coming years, world prices are expected to show only limited upside potential over the remainder of the forecast period.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government. [...]assuming, crucially, that assistance from Russia and China would be insufficient-we expect regime pragmatists to seek Western assistance-specifically from multilaterals and governments. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, has put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed administration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,500% at the end of 2017 and will reach 715,130% by end-2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, making the country the least attractive investment location in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of roll-back of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-at some point in the forecast period. Our forecasts are based on the assumption that this will happen during 2019. But the process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect the forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
The opposition, due to its own penchant for infighting and years of government harassment, is in disarray and incapable of channelling the anger generated by the country's economic crisis. Even so, the PSUV is dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen with military or political connections. This network is sustained by opportunities for corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls, subsidised imports, clientelism and control of wasteful public-sector companies. Within this arrangement, factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, resulting in different civic-military factions coexisting within the regime. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage system is the export revenue generated by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company.
Jeopardising the civic-military alliance is PDVSA's declining output due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been highlighted by periodic purges in the military and re-organisations in civilian posts within the regime. Given the government's proven incompetence and lack of financing, we expect declining oil output to jeopardise the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro. This process may be hastened if exports are disrupted by external forces, such as US government sanctions on the oil trade (the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market and a key source of production inputs) or asset seizures stemming from unpaid debts.
Regardless of the timing, what will happen following any internal fracture is hard to predict. The transition could be violent, chaotic and potentially lengthy. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current set-up is likely to unleash jostling for position between the PSUV's varied civic-military factions.
It is possible that the regime may reconfigure itself as an outright military government or with a PSUV civilian figurehead fronting a military-heavy administration. However, given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government. Thus-assuming, crucially, that assistance from Russia and China would be insufficient-we expect regime pragmatists to seek Western assistance-specifically from multilaterals and governments. As these financiers will demand democratic reforms, we believe that the most likely outcome of the political transition is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded regime leaders allow opposition participation to gain international legitimacy. Given past behaviour, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate.
The main risk to this mixed administration baseline view is that regime pragmatists will be unable to secure consensus within the regime. Democratic reforms (and consequent judicial accountability for current regime leaders) that Western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. Similarly, foreign financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the de facto legislature that is the Constituent Assembly (ANC), and the radicalised supporters of the PSUV known as colectivos. In this context, there are strong risks to our baseline assumption of political transition, and a strong possibility of alternate scenarios including a more permanently impoverished nation.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Municipal elections are scheduled for December 9th. Most of the opposition has been proscribed and only some parties are participating (which has led to further infighting). In this context, a PSUV sweep is all but guaranteed. Based on our political assumptions, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The US has put individual sanctions on most regime leaders, including Mr Maduro, his closest allies, and three of the regime's strongmen: Vladimir Padrino López, Diosdado Cabello and Tareck El Aissami. Although this limits the field of negotiating partners in the event of an internal fracture of the regime, the US has stated that sanctions may be reversed if the subjects "take concrete...actions to restore democratic order". The US has also instituted country-level sanctions that, among other effects, block Venezuela from refinancing its debts. Sanctions banning the oil trade are not part of our baseline assumption, but the hawkish US foreign policy team increases risks to this assumption. Despite recent public rhetoric, we do not currently foresee military intervention.
A priority for the Maduro administration is the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China, with a view to securing the necessary financing to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. Both have provided financing in the past but, despite recent announcements, they seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars required. A change in the current Chinese stance represents a major risk to our forecast.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The government has reacted to the deepening of the crisis in recent months, but it remains unable and unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Furthermore, patchy implementation has once again demonstrated the government's unwillingness-or incapacity-to enact real change. An economic plan launched in late August included the removal of five zeroes from the currency, a massive devaluation and another large increase in the minimum wage. The government also promised to abolish the monetisation of public deficits, but available money supply data show that it has not done so. As such, monetary imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that underpins our baseline forecast of political change. Furthermore, outside of promising a hard to implement reduction in fuel subsidies, the plan had little focus on PDVSA's falling output; production at PDVSA remains crucial factor in supporting the economy amid a collapse in the non-oil sector.
With no capacity to finance investment, the government announced in September that it had secured US$5bn in funding from China to boost oil output, but details are hazy. It is unclear how much has been disbursed and how much control the Chinese will exert over how the funds are spent. Regardless, the US$5bn seems insufficient to stem the decline in oil output and, if the increased production is earmarked to pay back Chinese loans, it will do little to promote macroeconomic stability.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under a new government. However, the pace of adjustment, and the policy mix itself, will be complicated by uncertainty over the stability of any new regime, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These members would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in leadership. An exception regarding default is a single bond issued by PDVSA, which has 50.1% of Citgo as collateral. A payment of US$949m will come due on October 27th and it is unclear if the government will be able to meet it. Crystallex (Canada) is already attempting to seize Citgo to collect a legal award and ConocoPhillips (US) has halted its attempts at seizing PDVSA's assets in the Caribbean pending payments of a settlement, the first instalment of which is reportedly scheduled for mid-November. We believe that, if forced to choose, the government would prioritise its Caribbean assets over Citgo, as the former are key for PDVSA's capacity to export while sales to Citgo could be re-routed to other US companies. However, it is unclear when the government may have to choose. In the short term, the regime may not meet the ConocoPhillips settlement, and try to further delay payment.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Despite the regime's assurances to the contrary, money supply continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 378% month on month at end-September. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is possible.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 1m barrels/day (b/d) in mid-2019, kept from going lower owing to PDVSA's joint-venture partners. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017, even at the end of our forecast period.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 233% (488,865% year on year) in September. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%. At the same time the government announced the "free convertibility" of foreign exchange, but in practice the exchange controls remain. The official rate is determined by an auction system, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early October the black-market exchange rate was around BsS110:US$1; the official rate stood at BsS63:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
After an estimated current-account surplus of US$14.2bn in 2018, we expect the current account to remain in surplus for most of the forecast period. These figures are buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2018 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus from 4.9% of GDP in 2020 to a deficit of 1.6% by 2023.
We currently expect that the new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority in parliament with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and possibly beyond.
Following the June elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016, there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will deteriorate in 2019-23, owing to bilateral tensions that so far appear hard to resolve. The possible US imposition of sanctions on Turkish banks for evading US Iran-related sanctions is a risk.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to about 3.5% per year in 2018-23, reflecting the impact of the August 2018 currency crisis, higher interest rates, global trade tensions, and more moderate export growth.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to TL6.2:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness and depress imports), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.4% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election, a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow down the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current-account deficit of US$47bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day, his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote on a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were very similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on political dissent and opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent impediments on freedoms. These are similar to those of the state of emergency, which was introduced after the attempted coup, in a bid to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the coup plot.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. The formation of a governing coalition between the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. In addition, the MHP will advocate repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP) as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. The AKP received 42.6% of the vote, the MHP 11.1%, the Republican People's Party (CHP) 22.6%, the HDP 11.7% and the Good Party (IP) 10%.
Local elections will be held as planned in March 2019, despite recent signals from the AKP pointing to an increasing possibility of bringing them forward to November or December. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in election mood until next year.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; and US sanctions on Turkish government officials owing to Turkey's detention of a US pastor on terrorist charges. The government's authoritarian tendencies and confrontational approach (partly motivated by Mr Erdogan's need to appeal to nationalists) have also damaged relations with Turkey's Western allies.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations. Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq; the fact that Mr Erdogan visited Germany on September 28th-29th lends credence to this view. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO (not our core forecast).
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Relations between Turkey and Russia have improved in the last two years, but the level of trust is still low. In September Turkey and Russia announced an agreement to create and jointly patrol a demilitarised zone in Idlib, the last rebel-held governorate in northern Syria. However, this does not alter our view that they are co-operating in Syria while pursuing contrasting goals (Russia backs the government led by Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, while Turkey provides support to rebels). As a result, we expect relations to continue to be transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high, all the more so as the Turkish government will seek to deter Russia from conducting military operations in Syria that could result in a large influx of refugees at the Syria-Turkey border.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector, and its dynamic, diversified private business sector.
In the aftermath of the failed coup in July 2016, a highly accommodative policy stance has exacerbated fiscal as well as external imbalances. This, together with heightened political uncertainty, the tightening of global liquidity conditions and tensions with the US, led to a currency crisis in August 2018. The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically over the past decade will remain a predominant feature over our forecast period (2019-23), at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. Such an approach will continue to have an important effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a key factor behind the high unemployment rate), and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options will remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support, partly because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia is at odds. Meanwhile, an IMF programme would include what the government would regard as unacceptable conditionality and would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Finally, there is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. Only China, therefore, appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe in order to foster trade and connectivity in the coming decades.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Despite a series of tax rises this year and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen in 2018, to 3.4% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017. We subsequently expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy, which, alongside a recovering economy, will lead the deficit gradually to contract in the second half of our forecast period, to 1.9% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to increase this year, to 29.7% of GDP at end-2018 (from 28.3% at end-2017), owing to the widening of the fiscal deficit. The ratio will then decline gradually, to 27.6% of GDP by the end of 2023, as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
On September 13th the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision represents a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
The central bank will need to keep monetary policy tight in 2018 to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira against the US dollar amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). In 2019-20 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that it will miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth has exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest-rate environment in advanced economies, and a diplomatic spat with the US-have contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar so far in 2018. The depreciation of the lira, which quickened in August, has caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, and has increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for September suggest that the economy is decelerating sharply in the wake of the currency crisis. After mild growth in the second quarter (5.7% year on year, down from 7.3% in full-year 2017), we expect the economy to contract on a quarterly basis in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. There are substantial downside risks to this forecast; this growth profile does not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
We believe that full-year growth will decelerate to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1%, mainly owing to base effects. In 2020 we expect full-year growth to rebound to 4.9% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average 4%, broadly in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate in 2021-30.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Even before the lira's collapse in 2018, inflation was already stubbornly high and well above the central bank's official 5% medium-term target; it averaged 11.1% in 2017. This year, however, the currency's depreciation and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to 17.9% year on year in August. The pass-through of former lira depreciation, together with higher inflation expectations, will keep inflation elevated during the remainder of 2018. We estimate an annual average rate of 15.5%.
In 2019 we expect inflationary pressures to moderate on the back of a modest appreciation of the lira against the US dollar, a slight decline in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. We forecast a slight slowdown in inflation, to an average of 14.5%, next year. The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 8.3%, as global oil prices decline, owing to a slowdown in the US business cycle, and the exchange rate remains broadly stable (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In the final years of our forecast period, we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of 7%-still above the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures). However, an expected pick-up in global oil prices and a depreciation of the lira will maintain upward pressure on prices.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2017 the lira depreciated by an average of almost 18% against the US dollar. In 2018 we estimate an average depreciation of about 30% (in nominal terms). Our baseline scenario is that the lira is likely to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in the remainder of the year, but that no further major currency collapse will take place. This outlook is underpinned by expected real GDP contraction on a quarterly basis in the final two quarters of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and the effects of this on medium-term inflation expectations, which will gradually decline.
In 2019, as inflation moderates and the economy rebounds, we expect the lira to appreciate and the exchange rate to reach TL5.6:US$ by the end of the year. In 2020 as nominal interest rates are lowered the exchange rate will stabilise at around this level. In 2021-23 continued high inflation as well as a suboptimal policy and political environment will keep the lira on a depreciating path. We forecast that the lira will decline to TL6.2:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP will narrow in 2018, to 5.2% of GDP, from 5.6% of GDP in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar will depress imports and boost competitiveness. In 2019-23 we expect a smaller average annual current-account deficit of 3.4% of GDP. Significant gains in competitiveness from past lira depreciation (notwithstanding the currency's forecast appreciation in 2019), moderating inflation and the emergence of spare capacity will result in a boost to exports and import compression over the medium term.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. Mr Tsipras will aim to complete his parliamentary term, ending in October 2019.
The government is vulnerable to further defections, and there is a significant risk of an early election The centre-right New Democracy (ND) is likely to win the most seats in such an election and to form a government, but it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests over labour market reforms, pension cuts, privatisation, and tax and social security increases are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's creditors.
Mr Tsipras's promises to lower tax, reverse spending cuts and abandon the pension reform agreed before Greece exited the bail-out programme in August are likely to cause tensions with the country's international creditors.
Greece faces its biggest macroeconomic challenge, now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments for almost two years after exiting the bail-out programme.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to a moderate 2% per year on average in 2018-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 170% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove difficult.
We estimate that annual average inflation will decline, from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.9% in 2018, before rising to an annual average of 1.4% in 2019-23 (the forecast period), reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. This will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-23.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment and as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency, under new management, gains momentum. Deals start to make progress.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. Capital buffer of about EUR24bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's financing needs
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result the reintroduction of exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of the tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) painfully slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: Lending hampered by need to increase provisions for still high NPLs. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn (US$31.5bn) and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.4bn, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Following the defection of two members of the AE, in protest at the agreement on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute, the government's majority has been reduced to just two seats. Mr Tsipras will aim to see through his parliamentary term, which ends in October 2019, but there is a significant risk of a pre-term election.
Tensions within the government coalition will persist, including over the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. The AE has said that it will oppose the name agreement when it is brought before parliament after the consultative referendum in Macedonia on September 30th. Mr Tsipras may struggle to obtain the required majority.
In August 2015 the government tied its acceptance of bail-out reforms under a European Stability Mechanism (ESM, an inter-governmental assistance fund for countries in the euro zone) programme to the objective of receiving debt relief from its official creditors. Three years later, on August 20th, the government exited the programme with minimal debt relief, having lost much popular support along the way.
Mr Tsipras now aims to revive his party's political fortunes, hoping that economic growth will gain momentum over the coming year and allow him to implement promises to lower taxes and increase spending. He also hopes to obtain a waiver from Greece's international creditors to postpone, or even cancel, agreed pension cuts in 2019 on the grounds that they will not be needed in order to achieve the country's fiscal targets (a 3.5% primary surplus). The Economist Intelligence Unit remains sceptical that real GDP growth will rise to much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expects that any attempt to roll back on reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors would trigger tensions in the country's financial market.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has been more than 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
In mid-June Mr Tsipras and Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia), announced their agreement to change that country's constitutional name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia). The breakthrough is only the first step towards a resolution of the name dispute, and-given public opposition in both countries-the agreement may fail to come into effect. Even if the referendum in Macedonia on September 30th approves the proposed change, it needs to be incorporated into Macedonia's constitution with a two-thirds majority in the country's parliament by end-January 2019, and ratified in the Greek parliament next year.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have risen recently. The risk of military hostility is high, particularly in the Aegean Sea, but both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in mid-August of two Greek soldiers arrested for alleged espionage in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions, which were threatening to boil over.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
On August 20th Greece emerged from an eight-year funding period (2010-18), during which it received a total of EUR288.7bn in official financial support from European creditors and the IMF (EUR32.1bn from the Fund), and was subject to three economic adjustment programmes. Repaying the country's outstanding public debt, which totalled EUR344bn (about 180% of GDP) at the end of March, means that future Greek governments will be subject to huge policy constraints. Fiscal austerity and policy conditionality will remain in place for the next five years and beyond.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup, Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released on August 6th. Of this, EUR3.3bn will be used to pay down the more expensive IMF debt, and the balance will form part of a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR24.1bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn) and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprise the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn.
Greece, in response, has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after its exit from the bail-out programme in August, it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term, through to early 2020. However, in the medium and long term the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will pose a significant risk in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In 2017 the budget surplus was equivalent to 0.8% of GDP and the primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) exceeded the bail-out programme target of 1.75%, coming in at 4%. We estimate a minimal budget deficit in 2018 (0.2% of GDP), but we do not expect Greece to meet its annual primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP this year, or in 2019-22. Although the target declines to 2.2% in 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve, owing to the fact that debt repayments become much more onerous from that year on. We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually during this period, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR317.4bn, or 179.1% of GDP, in 2017. Government debt is now almost entirely owed to official creditors. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain above 170% in 2018-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. It will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments, as shown by a marked slowdown in activity in quarterly terms in the second half of last year. We forecast that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to an average of 2% per year in 2018-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism performance. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Seasonally and calendar-day-adjusted real GDP growth slowed from 0.8% quarter on quarter in January-March (2.5% year on year) to 0.2% (1.8% year on year) in April-June, despite steady expansion of domestic consumption and a strong export of services (largely driven by tourism). We estimate that real GDP growth will reach 2% in 2018. This remains a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more, and higher, taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by 7.9% year on year in the first half of 2018. We expect a pick-up in the second half of the year to reduce the contraction to 1% in 2018 as whole, followed by average annual of growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still some 50% below its 2007 peak. Underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about the country's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.9% in 2019-23.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs over the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We believe that there is a significant risk that Greece might exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and a severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then grow rapidly, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
After stagnating in 2016 Greece's seasonally adjusted EU harmonised index of consumer prices rose by 1.1% year on year in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, notably in the fourth quarter. Inflation dipped sharply at the start of 2018, rising by just 0.3% year on year in the first quarter, before accelerating since then. In the first eight months of this year inflation on the EU harmonised measure rose by an average of 0.5% per month. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack remains in the labour market and domestic demand is subdued. Despite rising global commodity prices and increased tourism, we expect annual inflation to edge down this year, to an estimated average of 0.9%. We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.4% per year on average in 2019-23 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July before weakening to US$1.13:EUR1 in mid-August. The euro has since recovered to US$1.16-1.17:EUR1 in September, but will remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US. We expect it to begin firming against the dollar from 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2018-19 and US$1.21:EUR1 in 2020-21. The euro will also receive structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to an average ofUS$1.24:EUR1 in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 0.8% of GDP in 2017, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We expect widening deficits in 2018-23 as import prices rise and import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, but these will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Full text: Peru--highlights: Political outlook
The president, Martín Vizcarra, of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio, assumed office in March after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), resigned amid corruption allegations. The president has a small base of congressional support-his party holds just 14 of 130 seats-and, notwithstanding efforts to build political alliances, this will complicate policymaking and hinder government effectiveness. Although Mr Vizcarra's proposal for judicial and electoral reform-by means of a referendum-poses some upside risks for institutional effectiveness in the long term, it is likely to raise tension between the executive and legislative branches, and generate congressional gridlock in the short term. The broad reach of ongoing corruption investigations will also pose a serious latent risk to political stability.

Peru's business environment score rises in 2018-22, mostly owing to improvements in the political and macroeconomic environment, moving Peru up to 45th place in the global ranking, and third place in the regional ranking. Peru's key strengths are its openness to foreign trade-secured by multiple free-trade agreements-and its prudent macroeconomic management. The business-friendly approach that existed during the historical period (2013-17) will be deepened and enhanced under Mr Vizcarra as the government seeks to draw in foreign investment. Infrastructure will improve, although significant gaps will persist. Peru's labour market, albeit improving, will remain the weakest aspect of the business environment.
Peru--highlights: Economic outlook

Real GDP growth (%) 2.5 4.1 4.2 3.3 4.0 4.2

Exchange rate S:US$ (av) 3.3 3.3 3.4 3.4 3.4 3.3
GDP growth will average 4% in 2018-22, driven by a recovery in private investment. In the longer term, growth will hinge more on productivity improvements, as commodity prices will be lower than during the 2004-12 boom. Social and political pressure for higher public spending will persist, but the fiscal accounts will remain prudently managed and characterised by one of the lowest debt stocks in the region. The stable macroeconomic outlook will also be underpinned by low inflation and a manageable current-account deficit.
Peru--highlights: Demographic outlook

Population growth   1.1 1.1
Working-age population growth   1.3 1.3
Labour force growth   1.1 1.3
The labour force will expand more quickly than the overall population in 2018-22, thereby contributing to a demographic bonus over the next two decades. The formal economy, despite having expanded relatively firmly in recent years, will struggle to absorb new entrants to the labour market. Consequently, the level of informal employment will remain high. Underdevelopment in rural areas will encourage the trend towards urbanisation, which stands at close to 80%. There should also be further improvements in education and health indicators, in line with lower levels of poverty (which has been more than halved since 2000). However, high levels of deprivation will persist in rural and indigenous communities.

Peru is a fairly small market and opportunities will remain restricted by low purchasing power measured in terms of GDP per head, as well as by high levels of poverty and inequality. However, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class, notably in the capital, Lima. Rising demand from lower-income districts has led to a transformation in consumer patterns. Although progress will be gradual (constrained by still-low disposable incomes among much of the population), we expect this trend to continue in 2018-22. Public investment in infrastructure will support greater integration of outlying regions.

Growth in Peru's real GDP per head is forecast to slow from an annual average of 2.9% in 2018-30 to 2.6% in 2031-50. The weak institutional environment and widespread income and regional inequalities will continue to hold back stronger growth. The demographic bonus will have run its course by the early 2030s, weighing on total GDP growth. At the same time, education levels will remain low, with only modest progress forecast. Low inflation and a stable currency will contribute to macroeconomic stability. Abundant opportunities in energy, mining and infrastructure will continue to attract investment. Nevertheless, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and the prices of commodities.

Background: More than 12 years of military rule ended in 1980. Following a decade of economic and social instability, the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) ended hyperinflation, advanced reforms to liberalise the economy and defeated the Maoist Sendero Luminoso insurgency. However, Mr Fujimori subverted Peru's democratic institutions and committed grave human rights abuses. His government collapsed over a corruption scandal. The subsequent governments have been successful in consolidating macroeconomic stability, but have largely overlooked the structural reforms required to raise productivity levels. The current president, Martín Vizcarra, took office in March 2018 after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), stepped down amid mounting allegations of corruption. Mr Vizcarra's term runs to July 2021.
Political structure: The 1993 Constitution established a presidential regime with a powerful executive, elected for five years. Consecutive presidential re-election is not permitted. A 130-member unicameral legislature, elected at the same time as the president, also sits for five years. The government is decentralising revenue and responsibility to the 25 regions (including the constitutional province of Callao).
Policy issues: The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that there will be continuity of orthodox economic policies and that the business environment will remain attractive. Mr Vizcarra is a former governor and transport minister, and we expect gradual progress on structural reform under his government. The government will focus on improving the quality of and access to the underperforming public education and healthcare systems as it seeks to promote an agenda of inclusive development. Despite government involvement in the market, private investment in transport, energy and water infrastructure will remain strong. Bilateral free-trade agreements with Peru's main trading partners-including the US, China and the EU-as well as initiatives within Latin America, will help to keep investment and trade flows strong in 2018-22.
Taxation: The corporate income-tax rate is 29.5% (mining companies that do not benefit from tax-stability contracts pay additional taxes). Dividends and other profit distribution schemes are taxed at 5%. Branch-profit tax is levied at 30% and remittance tax at 10%. Interest paid abroad stands at 5%.
Foreign trade: Tariffs are levied on imports at 0%, 6% or 11%. The World Bank's calculation of the average effective tariff was 1.4% in 2014. Most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated. In 2017 merchandise export earnings increased by 22.1%, to US$45.3bn, whereas the import bill grew more slowly, by 10%, to US$38.7bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The president, Martín Vizcarra, of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio (PPK), took office in March, after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18) resigned after being implicated in a corruption scandal. Notwithstanding the generally weak position of the executive, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a relative improvement in political stability, which should ensure that Mr Vizcarra serves out his term ending in July 2021. PPK is the second-largest bloc in Congress, but it holds just 14 of the 130 seats in the legislature. Mr Vizcarra has sought to address the ruling party's legislative weakness by forging alliances with other parties such as the centrist Alianza Para el Progreso (eight seats), as well as with ungrouped parliamentarians (seventeen members). However, the biggest challenge to political stability will come from the opposing right-wing Fuerza Popular (FP), which holds 62 seats in Congress, and which led two impeachment attempts against Mr Kuczynski (before his ultimate resignation). That being said, FP has been weakened significantly as a result of the protracted political conflict with Mr Kuczynski.

Political outlook: Political stability
Although Mr Vizcarra assumed office under strained circumstances, he has thus far managed to improve relations with the legislature, partly through his appointment of César Villanueva, of the opposition Alianza Para el Progreso, as the new prime minister. He has also used his pro-growth agenda to build support within Congress for his policies, as evidenced by lawmakers' decision to grant the executive branch special powers to issue legislation through decrees on a number of issues.
We expect that the political scene will be relatively stable in the short term as political parties seek to minimise disruptions ahead of regional and municipals polls later this year. (Although there is little connection between local and national politics, national parties field candidates in the most populous regions.) The second reason is that approval ratings for Congress are extremely low, and the appearance of excess obstructionism at this crucial juncture in the economic recovery would worsen legislators' re-election prospects in 2021.
In the medium term, amid improved economic conditions, we expect legislative dysfunction to resume as political opportunism takes precedence over policy objectives. However, there is a high risk that increased political instability could come to pass earlier than we currently anticipate. The revelation of yet another high-level corruption scandal in July-this time in the judiciary-prompted the president to propose a referendum for comprehensive judicial and legislative reform. Included in the referendum is a proposal to bar lawmakers from consecutive re-election, a return to a bicameral legislature, and a ban on private financing of political parties and campaigns. The first point is the most politically charged, and could lead to renewed conflict between the executive and legislative branches. The risk is further heightened by the fact that the FP, the largest opposition party, recently gained three seats in Congress (after three former FP lawmakers-who became independents-were implicated in corruption scandals and replaced by FP loyalists), bringing the party closer to a legislative majority (they now hold 62 seats in Congress). If FP is able to secure the support of parties, such as the Partido Aprista Peruano, that have previously united with the party on key issues, greater political instability could follow, creating bottlenecks for Mr Vizcarra's agenda.
There are other latent risks to political stability arising from the broad reach of ongoing graft investigations. A number of prominent public officials, including the FP leader, Keiko Fujimori, are under investigation for their alleged roles in corruption cases. Moreover, four former presidents are currently being investigated for potential money-laundering and influence-peddling. All of this will contribute to public disillusionment with political and democratic institutions.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Mr Vizcarra's government will continue to adhere to the market-friendly policies that have guided Peru for the past quarter of a century. In particular Mr Vizcarra will promote policies for inclusive development, as he seeks to recreate at the national level the success he had as governor of Moquegua (2011-14). The government will seek to deliver short-term growth by unlocking investments-particularly in infrastructure-and improving the quality and scope of public services. At the same time, Mr Vizcarra will seek to improve long-run economic outcomes through greater investment in education and healthcare.
The centrepiece of the president's policy agenda, however, will be political and judicial reform, which form efforts to improve Peru's political effectiveness and institutions. Peru has a long-standing history of structural and institutional problems, with corruption pervasive across all levels of government and highly inefficient bureaucracy. The judiciary is known to be slow, opaque, underfunded and riddled with a culture of bribery and political manipulation.
Although Mr Vizcarra himself took office under strained circumstances, with his predecessor marred by allegations of corruption, the new president has made it a point to distance himself from any appearance of impropriety. Furthermore, Mr Vizcarra has signalled that he is willing to invest all the political capital available to him in order to push for an overhaul of the political system.
The revelation of one graft scandal after the other has heightened public disillusionment with Peru's political and democratic institutions. Many of Peru's most prominent public officials, including the FP leader, Keiko Fujimori, and her brother, Kenji Fujimori (a former-FP lawmaker who has been temporarily suspended from Congress), are under investigation for their alleged roles in corruption cases. Moreover, four former presidents are currently being investigated for potential money-laundering and influence peddling. All the while, there have been virtually no high-level prosecutions, reinforcing public perception that the current political system fails to deliver any accountability for those in power.
The unearthing of yet another corruption scandal, this time in Peru's judiciary, has drawn renewed attention to Peru's weak institutions. In early July a series of taped conversations revealed discussions between judges and representatives of the Consejo Nacional de la Magistratura (the judicial appointment board) about court appointments, sentencing in criminal cases and a host of other topics that raised questions of influence-trafficking against those involved. These revelations prompted Mr Vizcarra to present a far-reaching judicial reform proposal, in his first State of the Union speech on July 28th. The president's decision to include this in the framework of a referendum, which also includes broader electoral reform, took his opponents by surprise. Mr Vizcarra decreed that voters should decide if lawmakers can run for re-election; if the country should return to a bicameral legislature; and if private funding of parties and campaigns should be legal.
The call for the referendum, which has overwhelming public support, appears to be a politically astute move on the president's part. This is because two paths exist for the referendum. Congress can approve the referendum with a two-thirds majority, or 87 votes. However, if legislators fail to do this, the constitution allows the convocation of a referendum by the collection of signatures of 10% of eligible voters, or about 2.3m people. The latter allows the president to bypass the problems posed by Peru's constitutionally weak presidency and a fragmented and hostile legislature. Mr Vizcarra has also gone on the record to state that he will not hesitate to circumvent Congress if there are excessive delays in addressing his referendum proposals. It is clear that Mr Vizcarra's gambit is having its intended effect. Many legislators now feel the pressure to substantively address Mr Vizcarra's reform proposals.
On the whole, we do expect some judicial and electoral reform to pass. However, the FP and its allies are likely to push back against many of the congressional reforms, especially a return to bicamerality, which would diminish the party's legislative authority. In addition, Mr Vizcarra's proposal to ban consecutive re-election has been criticised by even the more moderate members of Congress for being an unnecessary solution to a non-existent problem; in Peru re-election rates are extremely low (25% in the 2016 general elections).
As a result, many of the reform proposals are likely to be watered down significantly. Although the president does continue to have the option of triggering a game of brinksmanship, by trying to force a referendum through the collection of signatures, we believe that he will be more inclined to seek a negotiated compromise. This is largely owing to the fact that Mr Vizcarra will be wary of triggering another protracted political conflict, as had taken place under his predecessor's rule, out of concern for maintaining stability and supporting the ongoing economic recovery.
However, given Mr Vizcarra's rhetoric thus far, one cannot rule out the possibility that he would be willing to sacrifice short-term stability in exchange for a chance of serious institutional reform. This would present some upside risks for Peru's long-term prospects, as the reforms are ambitious in scope, and are on balance likely to boost growth through increased transparency for investors, and greater efficiency and objectivity in institutional and judicial processes.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next elections are municipal and regional polls in October 2018. Peru lacks a formal nationwide party structure, and local-level parties tend to have little affiliation with national parties, leading to disassociation between the results of local and national elections. Presidential and legislative elections will be held in mid-2021. At this early stage, we do not see a clear frontrunner for the presidential race in 2021. However, the two-round system typically favours the victory of a centrist, establishment candidate, and we have based our medium-term forecasts on the assumption of such an outcome. Nonetheless, the lack of strong party structures also facilitates the rapid ascent of personalities and political outsiders, who could yet emerge before 2021.
Political outlook: International relations
Peru will aim to take on a leadership role in the region, following its assumption of the rotating presidency of the Andean Community, a customs union also comprising Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador, in May. It will also seek to co-ordinate efforts to develop a region-wide response to the rapidly growing spillover effects of a socioeconomic crisis in Venezuela (although we forecast little progress on this front).
Peru will continue to support regional integration efforts, such as the Pacific Alliance, an economic trade pact that also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In October 2017 negotiators from the Pacific Alliance met with representatives from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore to work out details related to those countries' incorporation as associate members of the bloc. Members of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) have stated a desire for greater integration with the Pacific Alliance, but we do not currently forecast any progress in 2018-22.
In November 2017 Peru and another ten of the 12 original signatories of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement, agreed on a framework to move ahead despite the US's exit from the pact. In March the 11 remaining countries signed a new accord, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. We expect ratification of the new agreement by the member nations by 2019. In addition, Peru has 17 bilateral trade deals in place, covering nearly all of the world's largest economies, including Australia, Canada, China, the EU, Japan, South Korea and the US. The government is currently in talks to finalise a free-trade agreement with India this year.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business rankings measure the quality and attractiveness of the investment environment in 82 of the world's largest economies, including 12 in Latin America. Peru's business environment ranking improves slightly for the 2018-22 forecast period: the country rises to 45th place globally (from 48th in 2013-17), and moves up one spot, to third place, in the regional rankings. Peru's improved ranking is due to a recovery in GDP growth, stronger policies for competition and investment, and continued strides towards expanding international trade agreements. Since the 1990s Peru has developed a solid track record when it comes to macroeconomic management, which will be strengthened over the forecast period. Our forecasts assume further progress in other key areas of the business environment, including policy towards enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, and tax policy. We expect the administration of the president, Martín Vizcarra, to continue the implementation of orthodox macroeconomic policy and rules-based fiscal management. Furthermore, despite indications of rising global protectionism, Peru will maintain its openness to foreign trade and foreign investment.
However, Peru's overall improvement in both global and regional rankings will be constrained by its scores in categories in which improvements are generally difficult and take longer to bear fruit, such as infrastructure, the labour market, market opportunities and technological readiness. Although the Vizcarra administration will seek to invest heavily in infrastructure development, primarily through public-private partnerships (PPPs), corruption investigations and excessive bureaucracy will keep the country from making gains in the regional and global rankings. At the same time, a constitutional requirement for the stability of labour contracts will hinder progress in addressing labour market deficiencies.

Peru's macroeconomic performance will continue to underpin the business environment in the 2018-22 period. Barring unforeseen natural disasters, GDP will grow at an annual average of 4% during the forecast period, well above the regional average, while year-end inflation will average 2.7%, squarely within the 1-3% target band set by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank). The fiscal deficit will continue to fall, moving toward the 1% legal limit set for 2021. Exports will remain strong, as will the trade surplus, as a gradual build-up of production capacity boosts mineral output, and external demand for Peru's agro-exports remains strong. The government undertook another round of tax reform in the third quarter of 2018 to boost tax collection as a percentage of GDP. The public debt/GDP ratio will remain manageable through the forecast period, and below the legal ceiling of 30%. Peru's reliance on raw material exports, however, opens it to the potential for external shocks; as does its geography, which exposes it to unpredictable ocean currents and massive flooding, as had happened in the first quarter of 2017. Corruption scandals and political gridlock could also impact the forecast, with the effects of a proposed referendum for judicial and political reform playing out from 2019 onward.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves during the outlook period, with Peru moving up in both global and regional rankings. The government further strengthened the Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y la Protección de la Propiedad Intelectual (Indecopi, the competition and intellectual property rights institute), which oversees policies to foster competition and ensure intellectual property rights. Concomitantly, the legislature, first in May and then again in July 2018, granted Mr Vizcarra's administration special powers to legislate on a number of economic issues, including competition. Legislation from the special powers will be approved and implemented through the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. Legislative decrees published in July revamped laws for public-private partnerships (to reduce distortions arising from lobbying by private groups), broadened the OxI mechanism, which allows companies to invest part of their tax bill in public works programmes, and improved the national registry of public assets. Price controls were virtually eliminated in the 1990s, and it is extremely unlikely that they will be reinstated in the forecast period. The risk from distortions created by state ownership of enterprises is mitigated by a strict adherence to legally binding fiscal targets.
The Vizcarra administration will not make substantial changes to the approach to public companies adopted by the previous four administrations. Private investment will not be allowed in emblematic state-owned enterprises, including Electroperú (state-owned power company) Petróleos del Perú (Petroperú, the state oil company) and Servicio de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Lima (Sedapal, the waterworks for the capital, Lima). Electroperú and Petroperú are listed on the local stock market, but shares are not traded. This will not change during the forecast period. The administration will, nevertheless, move to address problematic issues in some public enterprises. It will reform the loss-making Banco Agropecuario (Agrobanco, agrarian bank), one of four public financial institutions. The government will also attempt to secure private investment to modernise and operate the northern crude-oil pipeline run by Petroperú. The pipeline has suffered 25 ruptures since January 2016 and remains closed as of September 2017. The OxI mechanism was expanded in July 2018 to allow for investment in waterworks, including Sedapal.
The government will also focus on administrative simplification during the forecast period as Peru ramps up efforts for OECD accession. It currently takes 26.5 days to start a business in Peru, compared with 8.5 days in the OECD, according to the World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report. The government announced that it will propose changes to simplify building permits in order to reduce the time required. The average time to obtain a building permit in Peru is 188 days, compared to 154.6 days in OECD countries, according to the Doing Business report.
While continuing to guarantee private property, the Vizcarra administration approved a decree in July 2018 refining procedures for expropriating and transferring property to the state for future infrastructure projects. This will help to provide certainty about the terms of expropriation as well as the methodology for appraisal of the value of acquired, thereby improving investor confidence. A second decree establishes exceptional measure to acquire land around 18 airports currently under private management to facilitate expansion. The government also published a decree for the consolidation of the national property registry. A consolidated registry is expected in the first quarter of 2019 and will be used to design and launch public-private partnerships and facilitate investment.

Peru's score for policy towards foreign investment improves considerably in 2018-22, with the country moving up nine spots to the 21st place in the global ranking, and one spot to the 2nd place regionally. The government will maintain the broad strokes of macroeconomic policies in place since the early 1990s while making changes to encourage foreign investment, primarily in extractive sectors. Foreign investment is protected under the constitution, as well as through a network of free-trade agreements (FTAs), and bilateral investment-protection and promotion agreements. Foreign investors receive the same treatment as local investors, and can avail of most of the tax exemptions and financing options as their domestic counterparts. Risk of expropriation of foreign assets is low, and is expected reduce further owing to changes in regulatory standards.
The government will make progress in reviving foreign investment in the hydrocarbons sector, which has been suffering in recent years. Active oil and gas exploration contracts had fallen to 16 at end-July 2018, down from 24 in the year-earlier period. We expect a new organic hydrocarbons law to be approved during the forecast period, with the congressional Energy and Mines Committee approving the initial reforms in mid-2018. The changes will extend oil and gas contracts to a maximum of 60 years, up from 40, and will allow for royalties to be negotiated based on future production. The new law is expected to jumpstart oil and gas contracts during the forecast period. The administration is also working on new rules to improve citizen participation in the approval of hydrocarbons contracts. The decision to review the process came about in May 2018, when the government decided to rescind approval of five offshore exploration blocks awarded in March to Ireland's Tullow Oil. The approval of the contracts, by Mr Vizcarra's predecessor, provoked citizen protests and led congressional caucuses to file nine different bills in the legislature to void them. The new mechanism, which will be in place in 2019, seeks to better inform the population about the process through which hydrocarbons contracts are awarded so as to reduce the potential for social conflicts. The revamped citizen participation process will complement legislation from 2011 requiring prior consultation of indigenous communities before extractive projects are approved. The final decision is ultimately left to the state. The state had 17 prior consultations pending as at August 2018. Social conflicts pose a major challenge to extractive projects. The Defensoria del Pueblo (the state ombudsman's office), which monitors conflicts, listed 90 socio-environmental conflicts in its August 2018, with 60 involving mining and 14 involving oil and gas projects. The state estimates that approximately US$15bn in investment in extractive projects has been slowed because of conflicts.
In 2018 the government, for the second consecutive year, approved legislation to streamline PPPs to facilitate private investment in infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector. The administration forecasts up to $50bn in concessions between 2018 and 2020. In addition to tenders for Lines 3 and 4 of the Lima Metro, the Vizcarra administration plans to launch international bidding rounds for a light rail system along the coast. The US$6bn Line 2 of the Lima Metro is under construction, with 20% built by August 2018 and expected completion in 2022.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls is stable during the forecast period, with Peru maintaining its ranking regionally, but falling five places globally, to the 32nd spot. Peru will retain its commitment to trade openness, with more than 90% of its trade now covered by FTAs with most of the world's largest economies. Transactions on the current and capital accounts will remain free from restrictions and the structural strength of the external position virtually eliminates the threat of exchange controls being imposed. The BCRP will continue to ease requirements on US dollar deposits and credit from abroad, as well as continue intervening in the currency markets to manage liquidity and foreign-exchange inflows. The currency has been fully convertible since 1990. Peru has a tripartite tariff structure, with 70.4% of items entering tariff-free, and the remaining items paying a tariff on either 6% (20.8% of goods) or 11% (8.8% of goods).
Trade liberalisation has remained a pillar of Peru's economic strategy since the implementation of a watershed FTA with the US in February 2009. Peru had 15 FTAs in place as at August 2018, and has signed, but not yet implemented, two bilateral agreements, with Australia and Guatemala. It has held two rounds of trade talks with India and is looking to begin talks with Indonesia in 2019. Five rounds of talks were held with Turkey, but the process was put on hold in the first quarter of 2016. The government implemented in May 2016 the protocol for the Pacific Alliance, which also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It eliminated tariffs on 92% of goods entering from member countries and will completely eliminate them over a 17-year period. It also signed in March 2018 the 11-nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the replacement for a similar agreement that included the US until it withdrew in January 2017. Implementation is expected in 2019. Peru also remains engaged in the Trade in Services Agreement, one of the world's largest potential agreements, which involves more than 50 World Trade Organisation members. Peru, like many countries, has been affected by US protectionist measures regarding aluminium and steel exports, but the impact has been slight. We do not expect additional pressure from the US, which enjoys a trade surplus with Peru.
Business environment outlook: Taxes

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
The score in this category remains steady during the forecast period. However, Peru does improve in the regional rankings, moving up one rung to the 2nd spot, while falling ten positions, to the 38th place, in the global rankings (largely reflecting improvements in other countries). The tax burden in Peru is not a deterrent to doing business in the country. The corporate income tax rate in Peru stands at 29.5%, while the highest marginal income tax rate is 30%-both of which are low by regional and global standards. Peru also offers investors tax stability agreements to stimulate private investment. The government guarantees that the statutes on income taxes in effect at the time of the investment contract will remain unchanged for that investment for ten years. This scheme is applicable for investments greater than US$10m in the mining and hydrocarbons sector (or US$5m in all other sectors), over a two-year period. The tax system also offers entities a number of income tax credits and exemptions (for instance, on pre-operating expenses, interest payments and employees' health insurance premiums). Peru's score improvement is curbed by a relatively high value-added-tax (VAT) rate, which stands at 18% and is unlikely to change in the forecast period. Meanwhile, other indirect taxes will rise, as the government seeks to raise revenues. In May 2018 Mr Vizcarra's administration increased the excise tax in five categories-alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, fuels, soft drinks and vehicles-to boost tax income. (However, the government later agreed to refund 54% of the fuel tax to transportation companies, in response to social protest.) The overall tax system will also remain complex, with the time taken to prepare, file and pay taxes well above the OECD average.
The Vizcarra administration will modify the tax code to eliminate loopholes for tax evasion and avoidance. It will focus specifically on tax breaks for jungle regions where VAT and excise taxes are currently exempted. It also plans on extending the selective sales tax to casinos and electronic betting as of 2019. In August 2018 the government approved legislation requiring companies to specify the final owner, or beneficial owner, in tax filings. It also added tax incentives for investment in real-estate funds and modified procedures for companies using digital certificates to emit electronic receipts.
Business environment outlook: Financing

Peru's score in the financing category is unchanged during the forecast period. Its regional ranking remains the same, in second place, while its global ranking falls 11 positions to the 33rd spot (owing to improvements in the regulatory environment in more developed countries). The regulatory framework governing the financial sector is solid, and is likely to be strengthened in line with the Basel III framework. Although the financial sector is highly concentrated, some of the smaller banks have developed niche positions in specific types of lending. The financial sector's balance sheet is strong-the non-performing loan ratio has remained relatively stable in recent years, at between 1.5% and 3%. The capital adequacy ratio is well above the legal minimum, and liquidity levels are adequate. Bank profitability is also high, with the average return on equity of the 16 banks in the financial system is strong, remaining above 18% in the past two years. We expect greater penetration of the banking sector in the forecast period, with legislation enacted in August 2018 requiring all purchases with a value greater than three tax units (one tax unit is equivalent to about US$1250) to go through the financial system. Capital markets are shallow, but growing. Legislation promoting capital market growth was implemented in September 2017 and the Vizcarra administration is expected to use special legislative powers, granted by Congress in July 2018, to further promote development of capital markets. A legislative decree approved in August 2018 strengthens the incentives for investing in real-estate funds. Peru enjoys an investment-grade credit rating, and the latest legislation should provide the state and private companies with ample channels to access financing.
Large domestic corporations currently enjoy captive demand for their securities from three main institutional investors: the Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs, private pension funds), insurance companies and mutual funds. A wider range of Peruvian companies, including mid-sized firms, have issued bonds and equity financing will become more common during the forecast period. However, a weak corporate governance culture and concerns over public information disclosure will remain the main restriction to issuance of shares.
The Bolsa de Valores de Lima (BVL, the Lima stock exchange) remains small, but is expanding. Legislation from January 2017, building on legislation from 2015 to strengthen the stock market, exonerates income tax on different securities through December 31st 2019. The BVL will continue its integration into the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (the Latin American Integrated Market)-&[DEVICE CONTROL STRING]a joint initiative of the bourses of Peru, Colombia, Chile and Mexico-to become a single unified equity and securities exchange. Harmonisation of rules has been slow, but a new "funds passport" will allow for easier investment in mutual funds.

Peru's score in the labour category improves slightly in the forecast period, but it remains the weakest indicator, keeping Peru's rankings (at both the regional and the global level) unchanged. Labour rigidity will continue to hamper job creation and the low quality of education has resulted in a poorly trained workforce and low productivity. As at June 2018 73% of the economically active population worked in the informal sector and only a minority of workers have access to health insurance or pensions, or pay taxes. Regional differences in employment quality and productivity levels are stark. In addition, labour market mismatch is high in Peru, with close to half the workers being either underqualified or overqualified for their job, according to OECD estimates. However, given the lack of active labour market policies in force, this is likely to remain a concern over the forecast period. One of the positives for Peru is that wages are largely market determined; although a minimum wage is in place, it suffers from high rates of non-compliance. However, as a result, despite low rates of unionisation there is a high incidence of strikes-the majority of which are related to requests for salary increases.
The Vizcarra administration is unlikely to make any major moves to reform labour laws. The last effort to reform the General Labour Law was in 2004. The government, instead, will focus on unifying existing benefits and offering some levels of flexibility. This includes allowing companies and workers on payroll to negotiate vacation days. The administration will strengthen existing programmes, such as Tu Empresa, a mechanism launched in August 2017 to facilitate labour formalisation in small businesses and micro enterprises. Efforts will continue to better educate and train the workforce. In August 2018 the government modified articles in the General Education Law to improve technical-productive education. Regional education offices will create Technical-Productive Educational Centres once the legislation comes into effect in the final quarter of 2018.

Peru's score for infrastructure remains the same during the forecast period, but the country loses ground globally, falling 11 points to the 60th position, and regionally, dropping two points, to the fourth spot. (Peru loses ground both globally and regionally as other countries reap the benefit of past investment in infrastructure). Although the Vizcarra administration will kickstart a number of infrastructure projects, many of these will not be completed within the forecast period, which means that the extent and quality of transportation networks will stay largely the same. Although digital infrastructure will expand slightly, this will be concentrated in Peru's urban areas.
The country's transportation infrastructure was hurt by massive flooding in the first quarter of 2017 and reconstruction has been much slower than expected. The government budgeted S25.6bn (US$7.7bn) for reconstruction, with 77% earmarked for rebuilding infrastructure, 21% for prevention and 2% to improve the disaster response of national and subnational governments. The Vizcarra government in March 2018 recognized that only 10% of the work had been completed and re-launched the reconstruction process, obtaining legislative powers from Congress in May 2018 to decentralise spending and expedite efforts. It reorganised investment, in April and May 2018, increasing the amount for local governments to 45%, up from 16% in the original plan. The government used the legislative powers to produce decrees in July 2018 modifying PPPs, expanding the OxI mechanism, which allows companies to invest a percentage of their tax bill directly in infrastructure. The mechanism was responsible for financing 340 projects, costing S4bn, between its launch in 2009 and August 2018. Other decrees modified the process for the state to expropriate property for public works projects, and established mechanisms to free up land near 18 regional airports to allow for their expansion. Nonetheless, infrastructure will remain a key weakness of Peru's business environment.
The state continues to grapple with major delays in large-scale projects that were scheduled for completion by the end of the decade. The government announced in 2018 that it had cleared up issues with land easements on several projects, allowing for the pace to quicken. This includes the US$1.2bn expansion of Lima's international airport, but as at September 2018 the administration had not finished expropriating the land required for the construction of a second runway and a new terminal. The state has also not made any moves to revive a US$560m construction of a new airport in the Cusco region or a US$7.3bn construction of the southern natural gas pipeline. The two projects were awarded in 2014 and the contracts annulled in 2017; the former because of objections in Congress to a change in the contract, and the latter because of a corruption scandal involving the concession-holder, Odebrecht (a Brazilian construction firm mired in corruption cases across the region). Also blocked by corruption-related disputes, as of September 2018, are the US$800m Chavimochic irrigation project along the northern coast and the US$650m Majes-Siguas II irrigation project in the southern Arequipa region. Regardless of the issues of corruption, the design and execution of infrastructure concessions has traditionally been poor, reflecting low technical capacity in the public sector and persistent mismanagement of public projects.
ProInversión, the investment promotion agency, announced a list of 50 infrastructure projects that it will offer in the 2018-2020 period, to draw in investment of approximately US$11.5bn. Out of these projects, 40% are in transportation, 23% in mining, 10% in hospitals, 9% in water and sanitation, and 8% in energy. It had concluded two important concessions in 2018, awarding the US$2.4bn billion Michiquillay copper project to Mexico's Southern Copper Corporation, and the US$230m concession for the Salaverry port to Peru's Grupo Romero. In August 2018 the agency presented 384 projects, for a value of US$1.5bn, available for investment through the recently strengthened OxI mechanism. In 2019 the Vizcarra government will seek to establish a new infrastructure investment fund in the Pacific Alliance, which groups together Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. It is also working with the Pacific Alliance partners to harmonise treatment of private pension funds that would allow for cross-border investment by the funds in the four countries.
Railroad infrastructure is set to improve during the forecast period. The government has announced plans for a light rail connecting Lima to intermediary cities to the north and south, as well as a light rail that will link the northern cities of Trujillo and Piura. Peru is also working with the governments of neighbouring countries, including Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay, to begin the construction of a cargo railroad that would link Peru's southern coast with the Santos port in Brazil. However, the project remains in the inception stage, and construction is unlikely to finish within the forecast period.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technical disruption.
Peru's score for the forecast period improves, and it moves up two places in the global rankings, to the 69th position, and one place in the regional rankings, to seventh position. Penetration of information technology remains unequal: although 90.6% of the population nationally has a mobile phone connection, only 36% of households had at least one computer and a mere 33% of households had access to internet, according to the national statistics institute. Similarly, penetration of e-commerce remains low, with only 6% of the population making online purchases in 2017.
In 2018 the state took several steps to foster digital governance in the coming years. It published legislation that will require 173 ministries, agencies and regional governments to set up digital government committees by end-2019 to guarantee e-government services. The existing 1,864 municipal governments will be required to have the committees in place by the end-2021. In 2019 ProInversíon, the private investment agency, will offer concessions for the installation of broadband services in five northern regions. The state will also offer 21 new fibre optics projects during the forecast period, with an investment above US$1.5bn, to connect 1,530 district capitals.
Peru continues to lag behind the regional average for investment in research and development (R&D). According to a May 2017 survey by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnolgía e Innovación Tecnológica (Concytec, the national technology council), Peru invests the equivalent of 0.08% of GDP in R&D compared with 0.38% in Chile, 0.25% in Colombia and 0.54% in Mexico, the three countries Peru that is partnered with in the Pacific Alliance trade platform. The bulk of the investment, 66.5%, is in applied research, inventions and patents, while only 7.3% is directed towards technological development. This reflects, in part, the gap between university and industry regarding innovation, as well as the low quality of the country's universities. However, higher education in Peru is improving and will continue to improve through the forecast period as a new accreditation system is introduced. In April 2018 the government approved legislation that puts a three-year moratorium on the creation of new universities and satellite campuses, so that spending on higher education is focused on improving existing capacity.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government's immediate task is to ensure that the improvement in political stability translates into higher economic growth. The president, Martin Vizcarra, has drawn from his previous experience as regional governor of Moquegua (2011-14) to develop a broad strategy for inclusive development. His government will focus on instituting anti-corruption measures, executing infrastructure investment and improving social policies-particularly in education, health and security. Mr Vizcarra has already shown that anti-corruption reform is high on his administration's priority list by creating the Secretariat of Public Integrity, a new agency under the prime minister's office that will direct and supervise policies regarding integrity and public ethics. The government is also working to strengthen legislation that creates mechanisms for firms under investigation for alleged corruption to continue operations, so as to provide much-needed predictability to the construction sector. In addition, the government is looking to expedite reconstruction efforts, following extreme weather events in early 2017, and has already transferred funds of US$1.9bn to regional governments to this end.
In the medium term, Mr Vizcarra will pursue structural reforms including electoral, pension and labour-market reform. However, progress on these fronts will be piecemeal at best, given the difficulties around building consensus in a very politically fragmented Congress. Nonetheless, a number of the reforms that Mr Vizcarra favours will be attempted by subsequent administrations, as they are prerequisites for OECD accession-a longstanding goal of Peru.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Government expenditure 30.2 31.3 31.7 29.5 29.6 29.5
Government revenue 27.1 28.3 29.0 27.5 28.6 29.0
Budget balance -3.1 -3.1 -2.7 -2.0 -1.0 -0.5
Government debt 24.9 26.3 27.5 27.9 26.6 25.2
The fiscal deficit will narrow gradually over the forecast period as the government gradually pares down countercyclical policy. Non-financial public sector (NFPS) spending will remain high in the short-term, keeping the NFPS deficit in 2018 at its 2017 level of 3.1% of GDP. The deficit will narrow thereafter as the government dials down the fiscal stimulus and a stronger economy boosts revenue. To consolidate the public finances in the medium term, Mr Vizcarra is seeking tax reforms that would broaden the tax base, eliminate redundant expenses and rationalise tax exemptions. His government also aims to reduce non-essential public spending, and has already established spending limits for ministries and state-owned agencies in a number of areas including advertisement, conferences workshops and travel.
The 2018 budget calls for increased spending across the board, with particular emphasis on capital expenditure. Nearly half of the increased spending will be allocated to reconstruction efforts to mitigate damage caused by the "coastal El Niño" climate phenomenon that affected Peru in early 2017. Other significant infrastructure expenditure in the budget includes a commitment of US$1.4bn for a long-delayed expansion of the metro system in the capital, Lima, and a US$1.2bn investment in public works aimed at improving sanitation.
The government's infrastructure plan would push capital and overall expenditure to 7.8% of GDP and 31.5% of GDP respectively in 2018-19. However, there are some risks to our public expenditure forecasts, given the government's weak implementation capacity, which could result in a narrower than expected fiscal deficit. A change of local authorities after regional and municipal elections in October may also lead to greater delays in execution of public investment than The Economist Intelligence Unit currently anticipates. As for revenue, we expect improved tax collection in 2018-22. This is partly owing to an expected recovery in private consumption amid sustained growth in real wages and partly the result of efforts to reduce tax exemptions, currently valued at 2.2% of GDP. Higher tax revenue will only partly offset the rise in spending in 2018, but it will result in deficit reductions in 2019-22, when we expect public expenditure to be reined in.
We expect that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise in the medium term, from 26.3% in 2018, to a high of 27.9% in 2020, before easing to 25.2% in 2022 as the fiscal deficit narrows. Such a level is low by regional and global standards. Peru will retain good access to financing from domestic and international markets and, should external conditions deteriorate sharply (not our baseline scenario), the country would be able to access multilateral funding with relative ease.

The Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank) operates an inflation targeting regime, which has been instrumental in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Weaker than expected growth and falling inflation out-turns in 2017 allowed the BCRP to reduce its policy rate by 125 basis points, to 2.75%, in the 12 months leading up to March 2018, despite monetary tightening in the US. We expect rates to remain on hold, to spur credit growth, until the fourth quarter, when they will be lifted by 25 basis points as economic recovery raises inflationary pressures. The central bank will continue to lift rates in 25-basis-point increments in 2019, so as to minimise capital flight from Peru as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues its tightening cycle. A loosening of monetary policy in the US in 2020 will allow the BCRP to implement more expansionary policy to support economic growth that year. Thereafter, in 2021-22 the Peruvian economy will be on an upswing, leading to a renewed tightening cycle. A key risk to our forecast stems from emerging-market volatility: although Peru has thus far been largely insulated from runs on its currency, it remains somewhat vulnerable nonetheless.

The economy maintained its strong momentum in the second quarter, growing by 3% sequentially (and by 5.4% year on year), and we expect generally favourable domestic and external conditions to deliver an annual average rate of 4% in 2018-22. However, overall growth will be dampened by a forecast slowdown in global growth in 2020, as well as Peru's large infrastructure gaps and a lack of productivity-enhancing reforms.
On the expenditure side, private consumption will be bolstered by a recovery of formal employment, a rise in real wages and growth in consumer credit. Private investment will also grow strongly, particularly in the mining sector, which will reap the benefits of still-high metal prices. A number of public-private partnerships will boost investment in construction, transport and irrigation infrastructure. Public investment will be dynamic owing to ongoing reconstruction works and the government's large infrastructure plan. The rise in fixed investment will have a multiplier effect on growth through its knock-on effects on consumption. Historically, there has been evidence to support the existence of a virtuous investment-employment-consumption cycle in Peru. The contribution of the external sector to growth will be muted, owing to capacity constraints in the production of traditional exports.
However, there are risks to our forecasts, as investment growth is likely to be curtailed by transparency issues, congressional gridlock, and ineffective and cumbersome regulatory procedures. The construction sector is especially vulnerable to these problems, as nearly 30 domestic and foreign firms have recently been implicated in a corruption scandal pertaining to the improper awarding of tenders for public works projects. Judicial investigations into the matter have already led to six arrests and pose an ongoing threat to planned infrastructure works in 2018-19 (amounting to over US$9bn).
On the supply side, the economy will remain dominated by the mining sector, but the main productivity gains will come from the agro-industrial sector, which has grown quickly in recent years. Manufacturing will continue to face constraints related to external competition, fluctuations in global demand and a lack of skilled labour. Services growth will be supported by expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. The continued expansion of an emerging middle class will boost the services sector.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Industry will grow by an annual average of 4.3% in 2018-22, supported by strong prices for Peru's key metals exports-particularly copper. Despite a slight contraction in global copper demand in 2017 (by 0.2% according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics), it is expected to pick up over the forecast period, sustaining growth in copper prices. China, which accounts for close to half of global copper consumption is and Peru's largest trade partner, will be pivotal in sustaining a tighter copper market. China's electric vehicle market and significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure-as officials work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-will also help to increase copper demand. The outlook for copper consumption in India, one of Peru's fastest growing export markets, is also broadly positive owing to investment-led growth in that country. Although the copper price environment will not match up with the 2006-13 boom years, it will nonetheless be supportive of investment in the extractives industry. The government calculates that potential mining projects, principally in copper, gold, iron ore and silver, could mean as much as US$59bn in new investment. Furthermore, feasibility and engineering studies have been completed for close to half of the mining projects on offer, which should consolidate the development of a new mining cycle. We expect much more modest investment, as a number of the projects that the government is counting on are expected to face issues related to financing or face opposition from local communities. Community groups oppose the arrival of mining investment, citing concerns about damage to the environment and the fact that not enough locals are hired to work at the mines. Anti-mining protests often turn violent and mining projects suffer delays. Regardless, Peru will preserve its place as a pre-eminent copper producer (it is currently the second-largest producer in the world, behind Chile) and mining output will show consistent growth.
Manufacturing will also remain fairly dynamic, despite its vulnerability to fluctuations in demand from the US and China, given an ongoing bilateral trade war between those two countries, and competitiveness issues brought on by the combination of low productivity and myriad FTAs. As such, the areas that will see the most growth will be extractive or non-tradeable in nature. Significant investments in 2018-22, including in the expanding petrochemicals sector and gas pipeline infrastructure, will boost industrial capacity in the latter part of the forecast period. Successive administrations have moved towards the medium- to-long-term goal of developing industrial centres that will take advantage of the high quantity of ethane in Peruvian gas to produce polyethylene and other petrochemicals. The construction of large hydroelectric plants in the Amazon region will also boost growth in the energy sector. Construction, which has boomed in recent years, will continue to expand during the forecast period, although at a slower rate. This will be driven by the Vizcarra government's plans for public infrastructure projects (electrification, sanitation, housing, roads and new transport facilities in major cities), and private projects, including large retail investments in secondary cities and industrial schemes (such as a natural-gas pipeline, hydroelectric plants and mining projects).
Agriculture will record average annual growth of 4% in the forecast period, although the figure is skewed by a stronger performance at the beginning of the forecast period, as production is continuing to recover from the effects of the "coastal El Niño" in early-2017, which brought massive flooding and loss of crops. Peru is carving out a niche in international markets for agro-exports, taking advantage of growing conditions at home and new opportunities created by Peru's numerous FTAs. Considerable investment in irrigation and export capacity has gone into the sector in the past years, and output will be lifted in the latter part of the forecast period by the completion of large irrigation projects in the southern and northern coastal areas. These will add more than 100,000 ha of new farmland. The fishing sector is expected to grow moderately, with the focus shifting from traditional fishmeal and fish-oil exports towards fish for human consumption.
Services are expected to grow by an annual average of 3.9% in 2018-22, supported by expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. Planned expansion of large retail chains across Lima and in smaller cities will respond to the changing consumer patterns of a growing middle class. Tourism will gain in importance as infrastructure (such as the construction of a modern airport in Cusco), and hence access to the country's main tourism destinations, improves gradually. The continued emergence of a growing middle class will boost the services sector and will gradually contribute more to Peru's GDP growth as the latest wave of investment comes to an end.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.8 3.0 3.3
Annual inflation continued to gather pace, reaching 1.6% in July, up from 1.4% in June. Prices will continue to rise owing to stronger supply-side pressures (such as higher fuel costs) as well as demand-side pressures (as consumption expenditure picks up amid strong economic growth). This will lift inflation to 2.7% by end-2018, up from 1.4% the year before. Notwithstanding sporadic volatility, we expect that the BCRP's inflation targeting framework will be effective in anchoring inflation expectations, which should ensure that inflation stays within the 1-3% target range in the forecast period. There are several risks to this forecast, including sporadic bouts of adverse weather, which could drive up food prices, as well as an unexpected bout of currency depreciation, which would lead to higher import costs.

We expect real trade-weighted exchange-rate depreciation to be modest in 2018-20, at an annual average of 1.8%, taking the currency from S3.24:US$1 at end-2017 to S3.41:US$1 at end-2020. Thereafter, the sol will appreciate slightly, reflecting a narrowing of the current-account deficit and a wider real interest rate differential with the US, to reach S3.30:US$1 by end-2022. Inflows of investment and external credit will provide support for the sol. The BCRP will continue to support the ongoing process of de-dollarisation and protection of the financial sector, which is moderately exposed to currency risk. The balance of risks is tilted towards greater weakening of the sol than currently forecast. However, the risk of sharper than expected depreciation is mitigated by confidence in the monetary policy framework, strong reserves and steady long-term capital inflows.

Although the current-account will remain in deficit throughout the forecast period, it will show signs of improvement in the latter half of our forecast period. Notwithstanding the tailwinds of high commodity prices, the trade surplus will narrow from 2.9% of GDP in 2018 to 2.5% of GDP in 2019 as capacity constraints curtail growth of traditional exports while import growth remains strong (in line with a recovery of private consumption and infrastructure-related capital imports). The surplus will deteriorate further in 2020, to 2.2% of GDP, owing to a forecast slowdown in global trade, before climbing to 2.3% of GDP in 2022 (reflecting improved production capacity and export-market diversification). The primary income deficit will remain large, averaging 4.9% of GDP in 2018-22, owing to profit repatriation by multinational firms based in Peru. The services deficit will be roughly stable, at an average of 0.8% of GDP. Meanwhile, the secondary income account (mostly inward workers' remittances) will register an average surplus of 1.6% of GDP.
As a result, the current-account deficit will average 1.7% of GDP in 2018-22. The deficit will be financed by inward flows of foreign direct investment, which will average US$7.6bn (3.3% of GDP) in 2018-19. Although inflows will fall to 2.7% of GDP in a more challenging international environment in 2020, they will recover thereafter, to 3.1% of GDP in 2021-22.
Foreign reserves stood at US$61bn on August 24th (equivalent to 13.8 months of import cover) and will rise to the equivalent of 15.7 months of cover by 2022, providing more than adequate protection against external shocks.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Peru
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) peaked in 2012 at a historic high of US$11.8bn (6.1% of GDP). FDI flows have since ebbed, reflecting the end of the commodities boom, reaching US$6.9bn in 2016 (3.5% of GDP). Despite a recovery in metal prices, FDI inflows fell further, to US$6.8bn (3.2% of GDP) in 2017, reflecting the detrimental impact of a political crisis on investor sentiment that year. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to increase moderately, in nominal terms, over the forecast period (notwithstanding a dip in 2020), owing to resurgent prices for Peru's traditional exports, especially copper. At the same time, strong opportunities will open up in the energy, manufacturing, retail and infrastructure sectors. However, FDI inflows will stabilise at around 3.1% of GDP in 2018-22, considerably below the average of 5.5% of GDP at the height of the commodities boom in 2007-12. The stock of inward FDI totalled US$98.2bn at end-2017, or 45.8% of GDP. Peru does not have significant outflows of FDI; these totalled only US$262m in 2017, resulting in a stock of just US$5.4bn. Despite its small size, this stock has increased sharply over the past decade.
Origin and distribution
According to the government's investment-promotion agency, ProInversión, in June 2017 Spain, the UK and the US respectively accounted for 18%, 17% and 13% of the accumulated FDI stock in the country, followed by Chile (12%), the Netherlands (6%) and Brazil (5%). The stock of FDI was dominated by the mining sector, with 22% of the total, ahead of telecommunications (19%), finance (19%), energy (14%) and industry (13%); all other sectors had low single-digit shares. This suggests that there is considerable potential outside the traditional recipient sectors, with retail, transport, and tourism considerably under-represented compared with their shares of FDI in similar economies. One notable investment in the past resulted from the sale of the national telephone company to Telefónica (Spain), which partly explains that country's (and the telecoms sector's) large share of the FDI stock.
Determinants
Macroeconomic stability and liberalisation in the 1990s allowed for large increases in FDI inflows, following a period of sharp economic recession in the late 1980s. Annual average inflows rose from the negligible amounts of the 1980s to US$1.7bn (3.5%% of GDP) in the 1990s. During the first half of the 1990s in particular, the government aggressively pursued foreign investment in privatisation, above all in communications and financial services, and the development of abundant mining and energy resources. The implementation of business-friendly policies in the early 2000s, coupled with political stability-in addition to an ongoing rise in commodity prices throughout most of the last decade-helped to boost FDI inflows to an average of US$3.7bn in 2000-10, and to an average of US$8.3bn in 2011-15. During 2018-22 the government will continue to seek to attract private investment into mining, hydroelectricity, hydrocarbons exploration and infrastructure projects. However, risks to commodities prices will persist throughout the forecast period, especially given a recent increase in protectionist sentiment across the globe, and efforts to diversify into other sectors (such as services) could prove increasingly lucrative.
Impact
Increases in FDI during the mid-1990s funded a growing share of gross fixed investment. The impact of FDI on the wider economy in terms of technology transfer has been confined mainly to the spillover effects from a much-improved telecoms sector and a more efficient financial services sector, with investment in mining having only limited links to the rest of the economy. This is changing, as foreign investment in natural gas and hydroelectricity is improving sources of energy. The award of infrastructure concessions will also promote economic development across various regions (some of which are relatively poor). An estimated US$80bn shortfall in infrastructure and communications investment will also be a driver for increased public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Potential
In the short term, increased FDI will be driven by reinvestment of profits of foreign companies amid stronger economic growth as well as robust demand for Peru's mining exports. However, attracting new investment outside the mining sector will prove more challenging. Notwithstanding ongoing efforts to streamline regulation on public tenders, PPPs in infrastructure will frequently be subject to delays, given the difficulties involved in managing various stakeholders. Regardless, Peru's improving track record of prudent policymaking, FTAs with the US and the EU (which include FDI clauses), and Peru's rich hydrocarbon and minerals resources will continue to pique interest during the forecast period. Although the pipeline of projects over the next decade includes close to US$60bn in mining projects and more than US$10bn in hydroelectric plants, the actual investment flows will be lower owing to bureaucratic delays, local opposition, governability concerns, difficulty with environmental licences and uncertainty associated with metals prices. Other areas that will receive investment include hydrocarbons exploration, transport infrastructure, water and sanitation, petrochemicals, and telecoms. Non-capital investment will be led by the financial and tourism sectors.

Working-age population will outstrip overall population growth
Population growth slowed to 1.1% a year in 2013-17, down from 2.3% in the 1980s and 1.7% in the 1990s, owing to migration abroad and a declining birth rate. Population growth will remain stable at this level in 2018-22, keeping it above the global average, reflecting high birth rates among lower income households and advances in healthcare (reflected in outcomes including lower infant mortality). The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries. A modest rise in the old-age dependency ratio-the proportion of the population above working age-will be more than offset by a decline in the young-age dependency ratio in the medium term. The number of people of working age will therefore continue to rise faster than the growth of the population as a whole, providing a demographic dividend to the economy.
As with many Latin American countries, Peru has experienced rapid urbanisation in recent decades. In 2017, according to the latest data estimation available from the national statistics institute, 78% of the total population lived in cities, with about two-fifths of those living in Lima, the capital. Urbanisation will continue to rise during the forecast period as Peruvians seek better living and employment conditions. Informal employment, which is estimated to account for over three-quarters of the economically active population, will remain high, notably in the construction and retail sectors. Informal unemployment is expected to decline only gradually, helped by government efforts to ease labour costs for businesses via tax simplification and subsidies, but will remain high by international standards. The unemployment rate reached a record low of 6% in 2013, but has been slowly creeping up as economic growth has cooled, relative to the years of the commodities boom. Although the unemployment rate dipped once again, to 6.2% in the May-July quarter, amid an ongoing economic recovery, this masks high levels of underemployment, which affects as much as 35% of those employed, and is tied to a mismatch between labour market demands and the focus and quality of education.
Demographic indicators to improve but from a low base
Although Peru's demographic indicators will make progress in the next decade-as education standards rise, nutrition improves, and access to safe water and sanitation is expanded-they will remain relatively poor. Poverty levels have declined significantly in the past decade. The proportion of the population living in poverty fell from around 55% in 2000 to 20.7% in 2016. However, it rose once again, to 21.7%, in 2017-the result of an economic slowdown, which was worsened by a political crisis that year. There are marked regional disparities, with 44% of the population in rural areas still living below the poverty line in 2017 (down from 74% in 2007). According to official figures for 2017, 84% of the urban population had access to potable water through the public network (a further 10% are served, but water is not deemed potable). Meanwhile, only 72% of the rural population is reached by the public network, and a stark 9% of those served receive potable water. The extension of the water and sanitation network will remain one of the highest public healthcare priorities and will continue to receive substantial investment in the forecast period, as the government has planned large expenses in 2018-21.
Health status indicators have improved significantly in recent decades, although regional variations in infant and maternal mortality rates are pronounced. Average life expectancy at birth has risen to 75.5 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO); its figures differ from the local-source data on which The Economist Intelligence Unit's current forecasts are based. According to the World Health Statistics 2018 report published by the WHO, which for Peru contains 2015 data, maternal mortality rates have more than halved over the past 15 years (from 160 to 68 per 100,000 births), but are still above the regional average of 52. The mortality rate of children under five has been on a declining trend, reaching 15.3 per 1,000 births in 2015 (down from 40 in 2000), although it remains a serious problem, especially in the more remote rural districts. Latest cause-of-death data (2014) show malignant tumours are the single highest cause of mortality, followed by influenza and pneumonia. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes also rank high amongst the main sources of mortality. Our projections assume that there will be some progress in health statistics in 2017-21 but that Peru will continue to lag behind most other countries in the region.

The emerging middle class will expand, but remain concentrated in urban areas
Although the Peruvian consumer market will remain characterised largely by inequality, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class. Over the past decade, the capital, Lima, where most affluent consumers are concentrated, has seen a rapid transformation in consumer patterns. Retail and entertainment chains have expanded from the traditional wealthy areas, owing to increasing demand from lower-income districts and the emerging neighbourhoods (former slums) located in the periphery of the metropolitan area. This new consumer demand is also evident in secondary cities such as Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Cusco, Piura, Iquitos and Ica, where economic growth has had a wider impact. However, the growth of market opportunities will remain limited to urban areas, and the majority of the population (particularly in rural areas) will continue to have low disposable income during the forecast period.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects average annual GDP growth of 4% in 2018-22-solid in historical terms, and an improvement over the average growth of 3.6% in 2013-17, when the economy was adjusting to the end of the last commodities supercycle-to contribute to the continued gradual expansion of the middle class as the number of formal-sector jobs grows, albeit from a low base. The economy is expected to generate jobs for unskilled and skilled workers alike. However, those who remain in rural areas, or are confined to the informal sector by a lack of skills (where underemployment will keep the supply of labour high and will hold down income), will continue to see fewer benefits from economic growth.
The government's efforts to reduce labour costs-especially at small firms-could help to increase formal job creation, but raising skill levels will prove challenging, given poor educational outcomes. Although a strengthening of existing conditional cash transfer programmes will increase purchasing power for lower-income groups, their access to consumer goods and services will remain limited. Despite a sharp reduction in overall poverty levels (from more than half the population in 2000 to less than a quarter today), indigenous communities in the Andes and the Amazon areas will remain isolated, and high levels of illiteracy will persist, although literacy programmes have made some progress during the past decade.

Poverty and social inequality will remain barriers to market growth
Due to still high levels of poverty and vast social inequalities, the total size of the population is a poor guide to market opportunities in Peru. The World Bank estimates the country's Gini coefficient (a widely used indicator of inequality, with zero equalling complete equality and 1 maximal inequality) at 0.438 in 2016, less than in some other regional economies, but high by global standards. Low inflation, steady growth of real incomes and targeted poverty-alleviation programmes will gradually lift more families out of poverty, allowing the share of food in overall household expenditure to slowly decline, although it will remain high by international standards. Increased household incomes will bring about a shift in consumption patterns, with food and beverages losing ground to expenses in healthcare and telecommunications. Over time, growth of credit will encourage increased expenditure on durable consumer goods by a greater proportion of the overall population and those living outside Lima.
The market is geographically skewed, with metropolitan Lima accounting for about 30% of the population, well over 50% of all economic activity and 75% of consumer bank credit. Although Lima will continue to be the focus for investors, they will increasingly tap demand in areas outside the capital. Indeed, the last few years have seen a rapid expansion of retailers in the larger cities along the coast and in the Andes, and with a pick-up in growth in 2018-22, this trend is likely to continue in the medium term. Greater market integration is also expected as the government continues to increase spending on infrastructure. Growth, macroeconomic stability, low tariffs and a plentiful supply of foreign exchange should allow Peru to become a more significant importer of consumer goods. This trend will be accelerated by greater access to the US, Chinese and European markets under free-trade agreements. Although Peru's population is ageing, it will remain much younger than in developed markets, and the ongoing demographic boom will make consumption patterns more dynamic.

Initial conditions: Peru's real GDP growth averaged 3.2% between 1982 and 2015, and growth of real GDP per head averaged 1.1%. However, these figures disguise a marked improvement in economic performance during the 1990s, when the policy environment was transformed and the economy was liberalised after a period of macroeconomic instability in the 1980s, characterised by a debt crisis and hyperinflation later in the decade. These policy improvements spurred economic growth in the 2000s and helped the economy to withstand the 2008-09 global financial crisis fairly well. Although rapid GDP growth over the past two decades has enabled Peru to catch up with the Latin American median in terms of GDP per head, it is still well below that of developed countries. Weaker external conditions and slow progress in pushing the reform agenda forward to tackle longstanding structural issues means that Peru will continue to lag behind developed economies by 2030. Peru is well endowed with natural resources-ranging from metals and natural gas to productive agricultural land. Its main weaknesses are the poor quality of its institutions, coupled with widespread income and regional inequalities. Overall education levels will remain low, and the slow pace of institutional improvement, together with lower investment in capital spending, will be the main factors behind a slowdown in average annual growth in the second half of the long-term outlook period. Opportunities in energy and mining will continue to foster investment. Nevertheless, with export-oriented industries the mainstay of the economy, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and commodities prices.
Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects population growth to average 1% annually in 2018-30, before slowing to 0.6% per year in 2031-50. Fertility will decline in line with continued urbanisation, but the birth rate will remain relatively high, even by Latin American standards, and well above developed-country norms. Declining fertility and increasing life expectancy point to an ageing population. However, even by the end of the long-term forecast period, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over, at around 17%, will remain much lower than in OECD countries. Lower birth-rates and the current low numbers of pensioners means that the dependency ratio (the ratio of children and elderly to the working-age population) will bottom out at 50.5% by 2032, before beginning a steady upward trend. Emigration has been substantial enough to have had an impact on population growth; each year, around 300,000 individuals are estimated to leave Peru to seek work abroad, although significant numbers have returned in recent years, as the economy has expanded rapidly and opportunities in traditional migrant destinations such as Spain have been limited. However, economic growth, by increasing disposable income for those in work, will put the option of emigration within reach of a greater proportion of the population, and the gap in economic opportunities between Peru and a variety of countries, including the US and neighbouring Chile, will remain wide. Internal migration will also have a decisive influence on the development of the economy. The level of urbanisation will rise from its present level of 79%, but it is already high by global standards, so the increase will be modest.
External conditions: The export-oriented sectors of the Peruvian economy, ranging from mining to export agriculture, have long been the most dynamic. Peru is expected to continue to benefit from free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, the main market for non-traditional exports, and China, which in 2014 replaced the US as the recipient of the largest proportion of total exports. FTAs with the EU and other Asian economies will provide similar benefits. Integration efforts within Latin America are also gaining pace, particularly under the auspices of the Pacific Alliance, an integration pact composed of Peru, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, which focuses not only on trade in goods, but also on services, capital and free movement of people. Global trade flows will outpace world output growth over the long term, and Peru's increasing integration with the world economy should allow the country to benefit from global demand. Although the Peruvian economy is highly exposed to world commodity prices, its vulnerability to external shocks will be somewhat mitigated by greater export-market diversification, as well as investments in supply expansion of non-traditional exports (where prices have played only a marginal role).
Institutions and policy trends: Peru's institutions were weakened during the 1990s under the rule of the then president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000). The media and forces in Congress became co-opted by the executive, and the political system became more authoritarian. The transition from Mr Fujimori's regime highlighted popular demands for a greater degree of effective democracy and decentralisation, made evident by rising protests in Peru's regions. Nevertheless, the quality of institutions remains weak, characterised by a politicised judiciary, widespread corruption and the lack of a strong party system, which leads to legislative fragmentation. The current president, Martín Vizcarra, is devoting much of his efforts to overhauling the system by seeking to introduce a slate of institutional reforms by means of a plebiscite. Although we expect Mr Vizcarra to face many obstacles in the process, including protracted negotiations with a hostile Congress, we nonetheless do expect progress on some fronts, particularly judicial reform, which is likely to improve investor confidence through greater efficiency and objectivity in judicial processes. Our long-term forecast assumes that improvements in the conduct of economic policy and in the policy environment will largely be sustained. We expect the public finances to be prudently managed, characterised by low debt levels. Bureaucracy will gradually be reduced and the business environment, which in some respects remains non-conducive to entrepreneurship, will improve. Increased spending on healthcare and education will gradually have productivity-enhancing effects. Private investment will lead to improvements in infrastructure. A continued commitment to inflation targeting by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (the central bank), along with responsible fiscal management and a low debt stock, will help to maintain macroeconomic stability, while a flexible exchange rate will help the economy to cope with external shocks.
Long-term performance: We forecast average real GDP growth of 4% per year in 2021-30, easing to an average of 3.2% in 2031-50; this is strong by regional standards. Past reforms, in particular the establishment of private pension funds, will continue to bear fruit, helping to deepen capital markets and raise the savings rate. Nevertheless, growth is likely to be focused on resource-intensive areas, export agriculture and specialised areas of manufacturing, such as textiles. Relatively low levels of education for the majority, coupled with low spending on research and development-at less than 1% of GDP-will constrain the economy from moving into higher value-added areas, despite frequent attempts by governments to improve domestic productive capacity and develop industrial clusters. Economic performance will become more dependent on productivity gains as growth in the labour force slows and the economy remains reliant on the extractive sectors. Reflecting investments made in previous years and slow but sustained institutional improvements, labour productivity will rise by an average of 2.5% in 2017-50. We expect GDP per head, measured at purchasing-power parity levels, to increase to 32.2% of the US level by 2050, up from just 20.4% in 2017.

Climate change and sustainability
Peru's long coastline and diverse topography leave it disproportionately exposed to the effects of climate change. It is already a warm country, given its tropical latitude, and subject to droughts and extreme weather events such as the calamitous El Niño of early 2017, which caused as much as US$3.1bn (1.5% of GDP) in damages that year. Peru is further disadvantaged by the fact that more than two-thirds of its population, and most of its economic activity, is concentrated along the Pacific coast. These risks are also exacerbated by Peru's economic structure: although the agricultural sector makes up only 7.6% of GDP, it accounts for close to 30% of total employment. Furthermore, Peru is heavily reliant on agro-industrial production for its export economy, which will be crucial to the health of Peru's external accounts. Therefore, even though Peru is responsible for close to 0.1% of global carbon dioxide emissions, it will be one of the most responsive countries in terms of implementing policy for climate change adaptation.
In April 2018 Peru became the fourth country in the Latin American and Caribbean region to legally institute a framework for climate change mitigation, in line with the commitments of the Paris Agreement (which was ratified by Peru in mid-2016). One of the key implications of the law is that it makes Peru's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 legally binding. These efforts will largely be focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the Amazon region, which is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in Peru. Although the law designates the Ministry of Environment as responsible for monitoring progress on the goals for climate change mitigation and adaptation, it establishes a multi-sector approach that promotes the participation of regional governments, the private sector, civil society and indigenous groups in strategy formulation. The framework also seeks to promote research in climate change management, by making it a priority area for public spending. Climate financing rose exponentially, from US$400,000 in 2005 to US$216m in 2013, and will continue on a positive trajectory over the long term.
Technological developments
Peru's government is seeking to promote the development of new technology, both by introducing it into government services and by encouraging partnerships with the private sector. The government is currently working on developing a comprehensive regulatory framework aimed at encouraging investment into the growing industry by reducing regulatory uncertainty for investors, and therefore reducing the risk of bringing new technological developments to market.
For instance, in 2012 the Peruvian government approved law 29985, on electronic money, which has proven to be one of the foundational pieces of legislation for enabling the growth of electronic-commerce and mobile-commerce. The law allows banks and non-banking financial institutions to issue electronic money and includes a clear definition of e-money, facilitating its use by existing companies and new start-ups. The Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (the financial oversight agency) is also currently drafting new regulation to support the growth of a financial technology (fintech) sector in Peru.
As a result, overall e-commerce usage is increasing, driven by rising internet use by the young population, with an internet usage rate of 77% among persons aged 18-25 years. The m-commerce sector is developing particularly quickly, owing largely to greater mobile internet coverage than wired internet coverage, particularly in remote and rural areas. Mobile phone penetration in Peru is high, at 71% in 2016 (according to the latest official estimates) and this is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years. Although smartphone adoption is still relatively low, at 31% in 2016, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects significant improvement over the medium and long term, especially with a growing Peruvian middle class. The expanding availability of 3G and 4G services will also be supportive of m-commerce expansion.
An example of innovative products utilising new technology are mobile money wallets, which have facilitated the growth of m-commerce. The government has led innovation in this space by partnering with financial institutions, telecommunications companies, microfinance institutions and other providers to offer Billetera Móvil (BiM)-the country's first fully operational national mobile money system. This has encouraged private investors to join the scheme and offer their own m-commerce services.
Nonetheless, despite relatively low transaction costs for services such as BiM, the cost of buying a mobile phone handset is still high for some sectors, acting as a barrier to entry. For instance, mobile ownership costs 12% of total income for the poorest 40% of Peru's population, well above the industry target of 5% of total income. In addition, efforts to broaden financial inclusion will be impeded by high levels of financial illiteracy and a lack of confidence in the financial system (related to inadequate consumer protection requirements). For logistical reasons such as these, e-commerce and m-commerce services are likely to expand most rapidly in urban areas, with take-up of new tech services being slower in Peru's most remote areas.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]Turkey will remain an attractive market for international companies throughout 2018-50. Fact sheet Annual data 2017a Historical averages (%) 2013-17 Population (m) 80.7 Population growth 1.6 GDP (US$ bn; market exchange rate) 848 Real GDP growth 6.0 GDP (US$ bn; purchasing power parity) 2,188 Real domestic demand growth 6.0 GDP per head (US$; market exchange rate) 10,503 Inflation 8.6 GDP per head (US$; purchasing power parity) 27,100 Current-account balance (% of GDP) -5.0 Exchange rate (av) TL: To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow down the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar.

Full text: Turkey--highlights: Political outlook
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day Mr Erdogan's conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan to remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond. Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on domestic political dissent and opposition. Security risk remains high and Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). We expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations although they will be antagonistic and increasingly transactional.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2018-22), and its global ranking falls by ten places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, and inadequate policy responses to tightening global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Important shortcomings in Turkey's business environment are the politicisation of regulatory bodies and the judicial system; cronyism and corruption; mismatches between education and labour market needs; and widespread tax evasion.

Real GDP growth (%) 7.3 3.1 1.0 4.9 3.9 4.0

A heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking will remain a predominant feature of Turkish policymaking, at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. We believe that growth will decelerate to 3.1% in 2018 and to only 1% in 2019, owing to the impact of the recent currency crisis. In 2018 the lira's collapse and rising global commodity prices will drive inflation to an annual average of 15.5%. In 2019 inflationary pressures will moderate owing to a modest appreciation of the lira against the US dollar, declining global oil prices and the appearance of spare capacity.

The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 80.7m in 2017 to 85m in 2022, with the female population continuing to far outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by about 1% per year during the forecast period, compared with 1.6% during the historical period (2013-17). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of higher urbanisation rates, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control measures. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards.

The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. In 2017 GDP per head was US$10,503 at market exchange rates and US$27,100 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. We expect Turkey's GDP per head to be about US$32,700 at PPP exchange rates in 2022. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be about 66% of the EU28 average from 65% in 2017.

In the long term Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to be above that of other emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China. In 2018-50 we expect Turkey to grow by an annual average of 3.1%. Brazil is expected to grow by an annual average of 2.1%, Russia by 1.6% and China by 2.8%. GDP growth will nevertheless be well below that recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, mainly reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU28 average, but catch-up is likely to continue. As a result, Turkey will remain an attractive market for international companies throughout 2018-50.

a Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the currency crisis that took place in August 2018 are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow down the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current account deficit of US$47bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
On July 24th 2017 Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the incumbent president, and his political party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), respectively won the presidential and parliamentary elections. The AKP, a moderately conservative Islamic party, together with its coalition partner, the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP), hold a majority in parliament. Mr Erdogan, who became Turkey's first directly elected president in August 2014, has dominated the political scene since the 2002 general election. Under his leadership the AKP that he co-founded in 2001 comfortably won the general elections in 2002, 2007 and 2011. This was largely because of the relative economic stability that the AKP delivered, but Mr Erdogan's personal appeal was instrumental, as was his religious and conservative outlook, which is shared by much of the electorate.
The Republican People's Party (CHP), a social democratic party, remains the main opposition party in parliament. In recent years, as democracy has backslidden, the party has taken an active yet often ineffective stance in defence of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Its manifesto for the 2018 election argued that the current "one-man rule regime" was the main reason behind the country's economic woes. It thus proposed an end to the state of emergency (now expired) and the re-instatement of the independence of all regulatory and supervisory bodies to boost foreign investors' confidence and ensure future investment inflows.
In the June elections the pro-Kurdish, left-wing People's Democratic Party (HDP), managed to cross the threshold of 10% of the votes to enter parliament despite Mr Erdogan's repeated attempts to delegitimise and weaken the movement. The government has accused the HDP of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant pro-Kurdish group. The fourth party to surpass the 10% threshold was the Good Party (IP). This right-wing nationalist party was formed by dissident members of the MHP in late 2017. Its leader, Meral Aksener, and her colleagues broke away from the MHP following intense conflict with MHP leadership over the MHP's continued alignment with Mr Erdogan and his policies.

Political outlook: Political stability
In June Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day Mr Erdogan's conservative AKP secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the MHP. The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the candidate of the pro-Kurdish HDP, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Nonetheless, Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote on a high turnout. In addition, results published by opposition observers almost mirrored those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on domestic political dissent and opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent impediments on freedoms, similar to those of the state of emergency. The state of emergency was introduced after the attempted coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the coup.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the PKK and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. The formation of a governing coalition between the AKP and the MHP will have a detrimental effect on attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. In addition, the MHP will advocate repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
For much of the AKP's 15 years of single-party rule, political and government effectiveness improved. The economy has been well managed, and significant social reforms have been implemented. However, in recent years intensifying domestic power struggles, a resurgence of violence since mid-2015 and a failed coup attempt in July 2016 have delayed reforms. The increased concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament suggest that the efficiency of policymaking will increase. However, policy predictability and its long-term suitability, especially in the view of foreign investors, are likely to deteriorate.
In response to the failed coup the government introduced emergency rule, which remained in place until July 2018 and allowed the government to carry out an extensive purge of personnel in the military, the judiciary, the police force and academic institutions suspected of having links to Mr Gulen's movement. The extent of the purge initially undermined institutional capacity, although most gaps appear to have now been plugged. The quality of the bureaucracy remains moderate, and we do not foresee substantial improvements in 2018-22. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report, starting a business requires more time, procedures and funding than in an average high-income OECD country. Paying taxes also carries a greater burden, but registering property is simpler. Relative to some of its peers, Turkey outperforms Brazil and China in these categories, but underperforms Russia. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2017-18 ranks Turkey 67th of 137 countries in terms of the burden of government regulation.
Since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised-a feature that will persist in the medium term. Despite some displays of increased monetary policy independence in 2018, the Central Bank of Turkey will remain subject to pressure from Mr Erdogan's pro-growth approach to economic policymaking. Only at some points will this coincide with the central bank acting in line with its monetary policy mandate. The use of unorthodox policy instruments will thus remain highly probable.
Concerns about judicial impartiality and efficiency unlikely to be resolved
Concerns about the impartiality and efficiency of the legal system are unlikely to be resolved over the forecast period (2018-22), given the continued politicisation of the judiciary. An AKP constitutional reform package, which was approved by referendum in 2010, changed the appointment procedure and composition of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the Constitutional Court. The changes facilitated the replacement of conservative secularist-nationalists in the judiciary with Gulenists, who, until 2013, were close allies of the AKP. Shortcomings in the judicial process were highlighted in coup plot investigations and trials that began in 2007. These were only addressed at appeal stage and after suspected Gulenists in the judiciary began investigating allegations of government corruption in late 2013. The purge of Gulenists from the judiciary accelerated after the failed coup. Their replacements will probably display strong loyalty to Mr Erdogan and the AKP. The upheaval is likely to increase uncertainty in the judicial process and prolong cases further. The courts' tendency to interpret the law in favour of the state and at the expense of the individual is unlikely to change, especially in cases involving minority rights and freedom of speech. In our business environment ranking we expect transparency and fairness of the judicial process to remain poor and that its efficiency will deteriorate over the forecast period.
Foreign businesses operating in Turkey can reduce some of the uncertainty caused by the legal process by incorporating international arbitration clauses into their contracts. These help to shorten the time that it takes to resolve commercial dis-putes and prevent, in most cases, the need for intervention by the Turkish courts.
Corruption in the public sector is seen as a major deterrent by potential international investors; legislation has been introduced to tackle it. However, implementation will continue to be a problem, and political patronage is likely to remain widespread. The public procurement law of 2003 was drafted to meet EU standards, but has since been watered down and amended so that important sectors, such as transport and energy, have been excluded. Turkey has improved compliance with the OECD's anti-bribery convention.
Political outlook: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP) as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. The AKP received 42.6% of the vote, the MHP 11.1%, the CHP 22.6%, the HDP 11.7% and the IP 10%.
Local elections will be held as planned in March 2019, despite recent signals from the AKP pointing to an increasing possibility of bringing them forward to November or December. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in election mood until next year.
Political outlook: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies.
Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's crossborder operations against PKK-affiliated groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; and US sanctions on Turkish government officials due to Turkey's detention of a US pastor on terrorist charges. The Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and confrontational approach to Western allies, in part due to Mr Erdogan's need to appeal to nationalists, have also dented relations with Turkey's traditional Western allies.
The country's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between them is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2018-22), and its global ranking falls by ten places, to 59th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, and inadequate policy responses to tightening global liquidity conditions and higher domestic inflation have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Turkey's large external imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to shifts in investor preferences. After several turbulent months, with a currency collapse in August, the authorities adopted measures to halt speculative trades in the lira, and in September the Central Bank of Turkey raised its main policy rate by 625 basis points, to 24%. Together with the slowing economy, the tighter monetary policy stance will contribute to restoring macroeconomic stability in the medium term.
Important shortcomings in Turkey's business environment are the politicisation of regulatory bodies and the judicial system; cronyism and corruption; mismatches between education and labour market needs; and widespread tax evasion. Adding to these problems, the government has used emergency powers to seize or close a large number of firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement, which the government believes staged a failed coup in 2016. The seized firms will be sold off, probably to government-friendly groups. Foreign companies' assets have not been seized, but the weakening of the rule of law will deter foreign investors. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment (FDI).
Major attractions for investors include Turkey's geographic location, the size of the potential market, its young and growing population, a customs union with the EU, free foreign-exchange and capital flows, and a large and dynamic private sector.

Business environment outlook: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals. Companies seized because of their alleged ties with the Gulenist movement likely to be sold off to government-friendly groups.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered despite the scope of the currency crash. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkey-US trade and relations.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks.
2020-22: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector

The quality of economic policymaking and its institutional underpinnings have deteriorated in recent years. Under the executive presidential system Recep Tayyip Erdogan has used his new powers to extend his control over the central bank and other nominally independent authorities, which has resulted in inadequate macroeconomic policies and a loss of foreign investor confidence in economic decision-making. A credible and consistent return to more orthodox policies is needed over the medium term to ensure stability of the macroeconomic environment and the currency. Although we expect the country's policy stance to improve relative to that seen in 2016-18, it is likely to remain deficient given Mr Erdogan's heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking (not least to avoid potential social discontent).
The government has increased public borrowing to support economic activity since the failed coup, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit. Turkey's public debt remains relatively low at about 30% of GDP, giving the government some scope to support the economy in the event of a sharp downturn and/or the emergence of difficulties in the banking sector. The financial system has been well capitalised and regulated owing to reforms introduced following the 2001 crisis in Turkey, but it will remain vulnerable to political interference, financial market volatility, the sharp depreciation of the currency against the US dollar and the euro in 2018, and tightening global liquidity conditions.
Volatile domestic demand, reliance on indirect taxation, limited price competition in some sectors-particularly agriculture-and the sensitivity of prices to exchange-rate and commodity-price movements will make it difficult to reduce consumer price inflation to the officially targeted 5% in the medium term. It reached almost 18% year on year in August 2018 and is expected to rise further in the short term as a result of the sharp depreciation of the lira against most currencies in July-August.

The seizure of firms since the failed coup has created uncertainty
The state retains a significant role in many sectors, there is widespread political patronage, the legal system is politicised and corruption is rife. Private property is generally well protected, and private enterprise is encouraged. However, the use of emergency powers introduced in response to the failed coup to seize or close firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement have created uncertainty, particularly because of limited access to legal redress. Although the state of emergency was lifted in July 2018, the security law passed in that same month and the concentration of power under Mr Erdogan will contribute to a high degree of uncertainty in the medium term.
The government supports private-sector investment and employment with incentives such as tax breaks and social security and credit subsidies, with an emphasis on underdeveloped regions, technology, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), production of currently imported intermediary goods and "strategic" sectors such as defence, aerospace, automotive and pharmaceuticals. State lending programmes for small businesses have expanded since the failed coup as the Treasury has expanded its guarantees for banks, allowing them to lend to riskier customers. Lending capacity has now become more limited after a prolonged period of credit expansion incentivised by the credit guarantee fund, and the government is allowing Turkish banks to securitise their existing loan portfolios to clear their balance sheets and stimulate fresh lending.
Free competition is the norm in most sectors, and the Competition Board has power over mergers and acquisitions (M&A), price-fixing and abuse of market position. Like most other regulatory agencies, however, the Competition Board has limited effective independence, being appointed by the president. The public sector still plays the leading role in gas and water, rail transport, tea and sugar production, infrastructure, and social services such as healthcare and education. The state has a significant position in banking (about 30% of total assets), mining, the defence industry, postal services and legal gambling, and retains large stakes in Turk Telekom (30%) and Turkish Airlines (49%). There is a state-owned broadcaster (TRT), a state-owned home-builder (TOKI) and a state-owned oil and gas exploration company (TPAO). There are also sectors in which one or more private firms, including privatised companies, hold strong market positions.
Despite frequent legal challenges, privatisation is well advanced in numerous sectors, which include refining, petroleum products, parts of the energy sector, steel, mobile telecommunications, and tobacco and alcoholic drinks. The sale of power-distribution networks has been completed, and the government aims to continue divesting some generation assets. The pace of privatisation has slowed amid market volatility since 2014, but despite opposition from workers and farmers the government is pressing ahead with the sale of some state-owned assets in 2018.
Price controls operate for various reasons in electricity, gas, petroleum, telecoms and pharmaceuticals, and are expected to be introduced for bank charges. Competition is also inhibited by the large shadow economy; the smuggling of petroleum products, cigarettes and many other items; and the violation of intellectual property rights in many sectors, from software to fashion.
Political patronage and exclusive business networks will continue to play a significant role in business life. Companies close to government circles may be boldest in entering public tenders or operating in sectors where major decisions are taken by politicians, regulators or bureaucrats. Industrial policy may facilitate favouritism or uncompetitive arrangements. Some companies may face higher bureaucratic obstacles or tougher tax inspections than others.
State assets transferred to the Turkey Wealth Fund unlikely to be privatised
Political constraints and financial market volatility will delay planned sales of state-owned assets during the forecast period. Those assets that have been earmarked for privatisation include operating rights for more ports, the national lottery and horse racing concession, shares in toll roads and bridges, TOKI (Turkey's government backed housing agency), Vakifbank, more power plants, municipal companies in Istanbul, and some state-owned land. Control of the three main state banks-Halkbank, Ziraat and Vakif banks-looks set to remain in government hands. The state banks may sometimes be used as a source of patronage.
The establishment in August 2016 of the Turkey Wealth Fund has removed some government assets from control of the privatisation agency. The wealth fund is designed to help to finance large public works by using its assets as collateral, making sales of the assets under its control less likely. The fund now includes assets such as the state's stake in Turkish Airlines, Halkbank and Turk Telekom, as well as Ziraat Bank, Borsa Istanbul and a pipeline operator, Botas.
Build-operate-transfer (BOT) or public-private partnership (PPP) schemes will increase the role of the private sector in the management of airports, water and irrigation facilities, and hospitals. The railways are being restructured, and the rail network has been separated from train services. The state will continue to play a dominant role in the sector for some time to come, as so far only a few freight transport licences have been granted to private operators.
Despite public ownership of major assets, a more liberalised energy sector will emerge as a result of privatisation, new investments, the Electricity Market Law of March 2013 and changes in regulations that will widen consumer choice over power providers. A wholesale trading platform aimed at setting a reliable market price for electricity has been established. Gas market reform is likely to continue to lag behind that of the electricity sector.
There is scope for further improvement in the protection of intellectual property. Legislation has been gradually brought into line with EU practices. In particular, a single, unified industrial property law came into force in January 2017 that replaced a patchwork of decrees regulating trademarks, patents, designs and geographical indications. Turkish as well as foreign companies are increasingly sensitive to this issue, so there is also likely to be progress in enforcement.

Foreign direct investment will continue to be welcomed in most cases
Turkey's politicised judicial system, its poor record on corruption and widespread political patronage remain major deterrents for potential foreign investors. Nevertheless, the government and most sections of society regard FDI in a positive light, and high levels of foreign ownership in industry and services are widely accepted and respected. Turkey's heavy dependency on foreign-capital inflows gives the government additional incentives to attract FDI. Foreign-ownership restrictions are limited to a few areas, including broadcasting and civil aviation. The courts and sections of the public are occasionally hostile towards foreign investors when environmental issues or natural resources are at stake. A law passed in 2012 has boosted sales of property to foreigners by easing restrictions and waiving the condition of reciprocity for most countries.
Privatisation in energy and other sectors may provide opportunities for foreign investors, often in conjunction with local partners. The government will especially promote FDI in greenfield and expansion projects that can further its industrial policy goals, including import substitution and technological innovation. Low valuations as a result of the sell-off of Turkish assets in 2018 and the depreciation of the lira against most major currencies may also attract investors, particularly export-oriented firms that have receipts in US dollars.
In principle, foreign investors will continue to have the same access to government incentives as do domestic investors. Plans to improve the general investment environment by cutting red tape and streamlining the legal system will benefit foreign as well as domestic businesses. Restrictions on repatriation of profits are highly unlikely, even at times of financial market stress.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

As a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with a customs union with the EU, Turkey remains committed to a broadly open trading regime. However, global trade tensions have risen since the beginning of 2018, and political tensions with Turkey's trading partners have periodically caused disruption to bilateral trade and exacerbated exchange-rate volatility. Russian restrictions following the downing of a Russian military jet on the Turkish-Syrian border in 2015 imposed severe losses on the Turkish agriculture and tourism sectors in 2016. In 2018 escalating tensions with the US have resulted in tit-for-tat sanctions and tariffs on aluminium and steel trade between the two countries.
The Turkish lira has been fully convertible since 1989, and the authorities have not considered introducing capital-account controls, even during recent periods of severe exchange-rate and financial market volatility. There are some restrictions on agricultural imports, but concerned by high food price inflation, the authorities have in recent years been reviewing the system of tariffs on agricultural products.
Under the 1996 customs union with the EU, Turkey has customs-free trade in manufactured goods with EU member states and has adopted the EU common customs tariff, but has refused to grant Greek Cypriot ships and planes access to its ports and airports unless the EU facilitates direct trade between the EU and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is not recognised internationally except by Turkey. Turkey's import regime reflects the EU's free-trade agreements (FTAs). It has bilateral FTAs with the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA).
The government is highly unlikely to impose capital controls; it did not even consider doing so during the latest bout of severe lira volatility, in August 2018. The authorities in Turkey are keenly aware of the reputational damage that capital controls could cause, potentially impeding Turkey's access to international financial markets for several years.
The government is unlikely to resort to outright protectionism, despite its efforts to encourage domestic production of items currently imported in large quantities. However, short-term protective measures will continue to be employed to limit imports of textiles, petrochemicals and other items from lower-cost countries.
Turkey and the EU have agreed to revisit the current customs union agreement with a view to expanding it to potentially cover agricultural goods, services and public procurement, but talks have not yet started. Some EU politicians have suggested that talks should be linked to political criteria. If this were to be the case, the chances of reaching an agreement any time soon would be low. Turkey is negotiating or pursuing FTAs with several other economies, especially countries such as Mexico and Japan, which have signed FTAs with the EU in 2018.
In the absence of a Cyprus settlement, Turkey is likely to resist EU pressure to open ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. Similarly, without progress in its EU accession negotiations, Turkey is unlikely to lift restrictions on EU meat and used-car imports, eliminate discriminatory taxes on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, or open up trade in services.

As a percentage of GDP, tax revenue is low by OECD standards owing to high levels of evasion and limited administrative capacity. According to OECD figures tax revenue, including social security contributions, is about 25.5% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of about 34% (2016 data). The corporate tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018 for a period of three years. Personal income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. The tax-free allowance for wage and salary earners varies from the equivalent of 50-90% of the minimum wage, according to the number of their dependants. Seventy percent of tax revenue comes from indirect taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), which is levied at a standard rate of 18% (with lower rates of 8% and 1% for some items), and special consumption taxes on some goods and services such as petroleum, alcohol, tobacco products, motor vehicles, telecoms services and banking transactions.
Obligatory social security contributions normally consist of 20.5% of gross salary (up to a certain limit) from the employer, 14% from the employee and a combined total of 3% to the Unemployment Insurance Fund from both parties. Tax breaks, social security premium reductions and incentives are available to encourage investment in underdeveloped regions, important sectors and technological innovation, as well as to support employment.
Frequent changes in tax regulation and evasion are likely to persist
Frequent changes in tax regulation are likely to persist, as will widespread tax and social security evasion, which is encouraged by frequent amnesties and opportunities to restructure arrears. The latest example was announced in May 2018, mainly to garner political support ahead of the snap presidential and parliamentary elections. Plans to simplify the tax system have been on the government agenda for some time, but have been consistently postponed.
Foreign companies will continue to be treated in the same way as Turkish companies. Turkey is expected to expand the already substantial number of double taxation agreements that it has during the forecast period.

Reforms introduced under the guidance of the IMF and the World Bank transformed the Turkish banking system in the wake of the financial crisis in Turkey in 2000-01. As a result, it is well regulated, well capitalised and profitable, but it has become increasingly vulnerable in recent years to political interference, financial market volatility, currency weakness, high levels of foreign-currency debt in the private sector and tightening global liquidity conditions.
The three state-controlled banks and the four largest private banks dominate the sector, accounting for about 75% of total assets. The state banks have largely operated on a commercial basis, and government intervention in the private sector has been rare. However, the government has put pressure on banks to lend more and at lower interest rates.
In May 2018 a US court sentenced Mehmet Hakan Atilla, the vice-president of Turkish state-owned Halkbank, to 32 months in prison for bank fraud and facilitating a scheme allowing Turkish and Iranian government officials to circumvent US sanctions against Iran. Although not our core scenario, the US Treasury could decide to impose sanctions against HalkBank or other Turkish entities in relation to the case. Such a decision would further raise risks for the banking sector and accelerate Turkey's efforts to sign bilateral currency swap agreements with other countries (as it did with Iran in April and Qatar in August).
The banking system is solid, but its vulnerability has increased
Bank lending growth has recorded periodic surges since 2010, driven by falling government borrowing needs, strong domestic and global liquidity, as well as government pressure and credit guarantees. In the first seven months of 2018 bank credit to the non-financial sector expanded at an average annual rate of about 23%, but we expect credit growth to decelerate substantially as the impact of the 2018 financial market turmoil negatively affects the economy and asset quality.
The pace of share offerings on the volatile Borsa Istanbul has slowed in recent years. Market capitalisation is low, at about 28% of GDP in 2017. About 66% of the free float was foreign-owned in 2017, although this figure is likely to have declined as a result of the sell-off of Turkish assets since April 2018. As at mid-September BIST 100, Turkey's benchmark share price index, was down by 18% from end-2017.
Tighter global liquidity and high levels of corporate debt will restrict credit to the private sector, especially households and small businesses. However, the strongest Turkish companies, like banks, will continue to have access to loans from foreign banks and to local and international bond markets, albeit at high interest rates by international standards.
With economic activity likely to slow sharply and debt servicing more onerous because of the weakness of the lira and higher interest rates, non-performing loans are likely to rise in the short term, albeit from a low base of 3.1% of total loans as at August 2018. Low domestic savings will remain a constraint, but changes to the private pension system will help to increase the availability of finance with longer maturities.
Changes in bank ownership may occur, particularly among smaller banks, without changing the overall structure of the sector. The current government's antipathy towards private bank owners and sympathy for consumers and credit customers will encourage tighter regulation of certain banking activities, such as credit-card issuance.

There is a large, young labour pool, but workforce participation is only about 53%, partly owing to traditions that discourage female employment. Despite a greater number of years of formal education, the average level of education and skills remains below average European standards, and mismatches between education and the needs of the labour market persist. Employment of foreigners is exceptional, and obtaining work permits can be problematic, but some restrictions have been eased. Informal employment and subcontracting are common ways of avoiding tax, legal obligations and rigidities, and create unfair competition, undermine safety standards and hinder productivity gains. In formal employment, hours and conditions are generally regulated and inflexible.
In response to employers' complaints about high labour costs, the government has sought to lighten the burden of social security contributions, especially for underdeveloped regions and the employment of young people, women and people with disabilities. Following rises of 30% in 2016, 8% in 2017 and 14% in 2018, the monthly gross minimum wage is relatively high in Turkish lira terms (at the equivalent of US$340). However, it has fallen sharply in US dollar terms, to about US$340, as a result of the depreciation of the lira, which has also weighed on growth in real wages owing to higher inflation rates.
The change to severance pay may take several years to implement
Companies complain that the system of severance pay, under which employers are liable to pay substantial lump sums to employees who retire, or are made redundant, is too generous, hindering formal hiring. The government's plan is to establish a severance pay fund, to which employers will contribute, but the plan has met with resistance from unions. The change to severance pay may take some years to implement.
The government aims to make the labour market more flexible while improving access to unemployment benefits. We expect the use of flexible employment contracts in the formal sector to increase only slowly.
Labour market activation and education policies will raise skills levels and workforce participation only gradually. Despite the government's commitment to reducing it, unregistered employment is likely to remain a significant issue throughout the forecast period.
Restrictions on union membership, strikes and lock-outs that are incompatible with international norms promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU are unlikely to be lifted. Unions may be influential in a few sectors, but are unlikely to become stronger or more militant.

Turkey's infrastructure is broadly adequate for doing business. In recent years investment by national and local governments, as well as the private sector, have led to some visible improvements, ranging from rapid growth of domestic air travel to the gradual extension of the natural gas pipeline network to almost all provinces and the spread of broadband internet access and mobile-phone services. The AKP government's preference has been for large infrastructure projects with several grandiose projects in the pipeline. The contract for the construction and subsequent operation of a 3.9-km-long suspension bridge over the Dardanelles was awarded to a three-company consortium, including Limak, one of the contractors of the airport project, in 2017. Canal Istanbul, a canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, and a three-tier undersea tunnel across the Bosphorus are in the process of being put out to tender.
Fixed-line broadband internet access has expanded rapidly, but, at an estimated 14.7% in 2016, the penetration rate was still well below an average of 30-40% for most other European countries. Including large and rapidly rising numbers of mobile broadband subscriptions, the penetration rate is much higher. About 80% of all mobile subscriptions are now third- (3G) and fourth-generation (4G) technology began to be offered in 2016.
Major infrastructure projects are under way, but shortcomings persist
Infrastructure shortcomings will persist in most cities including urban overcrowding, congestion, earthquake risk and strains on water supply and waste disposal systems and the energy network. Rural infrastructure should improve a little in most places. Major irrigation works, including those in the south-east, will proceed slowly.
Improvements in road and rail transport infrastructure will be piecemeal, and as a whole it will continue to lag behind EU standards, especially given the long distances between cities. Public and private investment will ensure that seaport capacity expands, despite bottlenecks and incomplete privatisation of management rights at some state-owned ports.
Energy sector privatisation and market liberalisation will continue gradually. Legislation facilitating the privatisation of lignite reserves is being implemented. Private investment (coupled with limited public investment) may be enough to increase power-generation capacity, cut transmission and distribution losses and prevent blackouts. Policies favouring energy generation from local and renewable sources will help to reduce gradually reliance on imported fuels.
We expect legislation to encourage private-sector oil and gas exploration to lead to an intensification of offshore activity in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The government has begun to explore the possibility of exploiting shale gas potential in the south east and other parts of Turkey. Plans to construct two nuclear plants are highly controversial, and if they are built, they will not come on stream until the early 2020s.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Turkey ranks joint 46th with Romania in the global rankings for technological readiness in the forecast period, but well behind Bulgaria and Russia in joint 35th place.
E-commerce is growing rapidly, reflecting steady improvements in the online environment in areas such as security and after-sales service, but growth is from a low base with online purchases accounting for only about 4% of total retail sales compared with about 10% in developed economies. As in most countries, the number of fixed-line subscriptions has declined steadily, but mobile-phone penetration has risen rapidly, reaching 95% in 2017. Intense competition in the mobile-telecoms sector should ensure that infrastructure remains adequate and up to date, although there may be delays in adopting the latest technology or it may initially be expensive or concentrated in major cities. Computer ownership has risen rapidly. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), an estimated 84% of households had access to the internet in April 2018, up from about 30% a decade earlier.
In the five years to 2016 research and development (R&D) spending averaged about 0.9% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. However, given that nominal GDP growth averaged 14.5% in the same five-year period, R&D spending rose strongly in nominal terms, which we expect to continue. R&D spending is significantly greater than in Romania and broadly in line with that in Greece, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia (which averaged 0.9-1% of GDP over this period). As in most emerging economies, large, export-oriented private-sector firms account for the bulk of R&D spending in Turkey. The automotive sector, which is largely comprised of joint ventures between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, accounted for 14% of total R&D spending in 2017.
FDI will continue to be the main driver of investment in technology and innovation. According to data from the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office, about 60% of total patent applications are foreign. As FDI into Turkey gradually recovers in our forecast period, we expect R&D spending to increase progressively.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector, and its dynamic, diversified private business sector.
In the aftermath of the failed coup in mid-2016 a highly accommodative policy stance has exacerbated fiscal as well as external imbalances. This, together with heightened political uncertainty, the tightening of global liquidity conditions and tensions with the US, led to a full-blown currency crisis in August 2018. The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, has enthusiastically espoused over the past decade will remain a predominant feature of Turkish policymaking in 2018-22, at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. Such an approach will continue to have an important effect on monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending, among others. In addition, current shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, labour skills mismatches (a major factor of the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed over the forecast period (2018-22), as propping economic growth-at all costs, partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the government's priority.
In the case of an adverse economic scenario (not The Economist Intelligence Unit's core forecast), Turkey's options will remain limited, as countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) appear unwilling and unable to offer financial support at present (partly as Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia is currently at odds). Meanwhile an IMF programme would include unacceptable conditionality in the government's view and run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Finally, there is little prospect for financial assistance from the EU, all the more so as there would be no political consensus on this issue among EU member states. As a result, only China appears able to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey at present; such a programme could be part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe in order to foster trade and connectivity in the coming decades.

Government debt 28.3 30.0 29.6 28.7 28.3 27.9
The public finances have traditionally been one of the most reassuring aspects of the Turkish economy. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Despite a series of tax increases this year and official promises of budgetary tightening, increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen in 2018, to 3.4% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
We subsequently expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy, which, alongside a recovering economy, will result in a gradually contracting deficit in the second half of our forecast period, to 2% of GDP in 2022.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to increase this year, to 30.2% of GDP at end-2018 (from 28.3% at end-2017), owing to the widening of the fiscal deficit. The debt/GDP ratio will then decline gradually, to 28% of GDP by the end of 2022, as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.

The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira against the US dollar amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank).
The Central Bank of Turkey raised rates by 625 basis points in September 2018, to 24%, so we do not expect further rate increase in the remainder of the year. In spite of this, if needed the central bank will be able to tighten its stance by shifting funding from the main policy rate to the late liquidity window rate that stands 300 basis points above the main rate. In 2019-20 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation in financial market conditions.
In 2021-22 we believe that the central bank will not hit its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance and its influence on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would be required to credibly lower inflation to the 5% target.

Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand.
However, the surge in economic growth has exacerbated existing internal and external imbalances. Coupled with heightened political and policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the Central Bank of Turkey, increased reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US, rising external imbalances have contributed to the lira losing about 43% of its value so far in 2018. The depreciation of the lira, which sped up dramatically in August, has caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and significantly raised the debt servicing costs of liabilities that are denominated in foreign currency. Rising domestic interest rates (the money market rate stood at 21.8% in August) and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators from August (latest available data) suggest that the economy is decelerating sharply in the wake of the currency crisis. After mild growth in the second quarter of 2018 (at 5.2% year on year, from 7.3% in 2017), we expect the economy to contract on a quarterly basis in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, as well as in the first quarter of 2019. However, there are substantial downside risks to this fairly optimistic forecast; this growth profile does not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans (NPLs) to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
We now believe that full-year growth will decelerate to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1%, mainly owing to base effects. In 2020 we expect full-year growth to rebound as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-22 economic growth will average 4%, broadly in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate in 2021-30.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
As in most developing countries, the share of agriculture in nominal GDP has declined steadily in Turkey in recent decades, but at 6.8% of gross value added in 2017 agriculture remains an important sector, especially considering the input that it makes to Turkey's food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing industry. In addition, agriculture still accounts for a substantial share of about 19% of total employment, although almost half of those employed in the sector are classified as unpaid family workers. We expect the share of output of the primary sector to shrink slightly during the forecast period, but it will remain large compared with most other European countries at just over 6% of GDP in 2022. In 2016 the sector was hit by Russian sanctions on agricultural imports from Turkey, but most were lifted by mid-2017 following the rapprochement between the two countries in June 2016. The sector would benefit from investment in irrigation in the south east of the country and in some other regions, but investment is likely to remain on hold in areas affected by the conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More generally, the importance of modern, large-scale agricultural enterprises will spread gradually, but the problems of traditional agriculture and unclear policymaking are likely to persist.
Manufacturing will continue to play a central role in the Turkish economy
Industry, including manufacturing, mining and construction, accounted for about 32% of GDP in 2017. The collapse in investment and export demand during the 2008-09 global crisis hit the manufacturing and construction sectors hardest. Since then manufacturing, and particularly construction, has rebounded. In 2017 manufacturing accounted for about 23% of GDP, compared with about 25% at the end of the 1990s. Having fallen as low as 6.3% of GDP in 2009, the construction sector accounted for an impressive 8.6% in 2017.
Construction has been a significant driver of economic growth in recent years. In 2017 real value added in the sector, which is dominated by housing construction, expanded by 9%, following growth of about 5% in the previous three years. The pace of housing construction has outstripped demand for several years, even after allowing for strong demographically driven growth in the number of households and the continued replacement of existing buildings. In 2017 growth was bolstered by the strong expansion in credit, in turn the result of pressures by Mr Erdogan on banks to lower mortgage rates, the indirect effect of the credit guarantee fund, the relaxation of macroprudential measures and ample global international liquidity. As at mid-2018 this has resulted in a reported 1.5m-2m new homes being unoccupied, a situation that has weakened developers' finances and reduced the incentive for new investments. Infrastructure and building investments via public-private partnerships, which have picked up significantly over the past five years, have also contributed to robust construction growth. In the first half of 2018 construction output stagnated, and this weakness is likely to persist into 2019 given the oversupply of housing, the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar, high interest rates and the slowdown in economic growth.
Although several manufacturing subsectors, such as automotive, and textiles and clothing, are strongly export-oriented and will continue to generate trade surpluses, Turkey's manufactured exports are generally import intensive; that is, a large portion of the inputs, whether energy, intermediates or capital goods, are imported, adding to Turkey's external imbalances, especially when international commodity prices are high or the lira weak, as it has been since mid-2013. This structural situation is unlikely to change much during the forecast period, as reducing the import intensity of exports and moving up the value-added chain will take time, even though these were explicit goals in the government's investment-incentive system, introduced in 2012.
Vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe
The automotive sector was Turkey's biggest exporter in 2017, with exports valued at about US$23.9bn-up from US$21.1bn in 2016,&[DEVICE CONTROL STRING]according to data from the Ministry of Customs and Trade. That year Turkey was the 14th-largest vehicle producer in the world, just behind the UK. Output rose by 14% year on year to 1.7m vehicles in 2017, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. This increase was mainly due to the weaker lira, which boosted export sales by 17%, according to the Automotive Manufacturers Association (OSD). Exports in the first six months of 2018 were up by 15% in US dollar terms. Almost 80% of vehicles produced in Turkey are exported, and the bulk of these go to the EU. As a result, vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe. Demand in Europe has picked up since mid-2013, probably reflecting the release of pent-up demand after several years of weakness. Although economic growth will soften in the EU over the medium term, the recent significant depreciation of the lira against the US dollar is likely to continue to support firm export volumes. Given its location and its trade agreement with the EU, Turkey will remain an important automotive hub, but political uncertainties will weigh on investor confidence. Over the medium term, given the growth potential of the automotive market in Turkey and the wider region, manufacturers with production plants in Turkey may start to focus more on the Turkish, Middle Eastern and North African markets. The domestic market will be supported by rising incomes and replacement demand.
We believe that most manufacturers will maintain their production facilities in Turkey. These facilities are technologically advanced, and labour costs are much lower in Turkey than in core European countries, and are probably below those in most central and east European countries, where wages have risen strongly following accession to the EU. However, if Turkey is to remain a major automotive production location in the medium to long term, manufacturers will have to move away from exporting low-end passenger cars, light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and components to north European markets, and towards developing and producing alternative energy engines and vehicles. There are signs that this transition is already happening; in 2017 sales of electric and hybrid cars rose by more than 350% to 4,528 units, according to data from Turkey's Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. The market will be supported by recent cuts to taxes on hybrid and electric vehicles.
The textiles and clothing industries remain important activities in the Turkish economy and in 2017 accounted for 17% of the country's export revenues. The industries have undergone restructuring under the intense pressure of competition from low-cost producers in Asia. The government has also been looking at ways to improve investment incentives and target higher value-added products. In the short term, high-frequency indicators suggest that both these industries will suffer from subdued domestic demand. However, over the medium term a more competitive currency and ample growth potential will underpin robust growth prospects. Competitive pressures from lower-cost centres of production will remain a risk.
Production of industrial machinery and of white goods and other household durables, including furniture, recovered strongly as a result of a pick-up in domestic demand and export opportunities in 2010-11. After more moderate domestic and external demand dampened growth in output in 2012-16, growth surged in 2017 alongside the boom in housing and credit. We expect Turkish consumer electronics companies to continue to be major exporters, although domestic demand will constrain the sector in the near-term. Businesses in the sector appear to have been slow to adopt technological innovations in some segments.
If security concerns diminish, growth potential in tourism is good
Tourism, one of the most important services sectors of the Turkish economy, has witnessed rapid growth in the past ten years, but it remains vulnerable to geopolitical developments and changes in the exchange rate. Having reached a new record of 37m in 2014, the number of foreign visitors (excluding Turkish citizens living abroad) dipped slightly in 2015, reflecting mainly the impact of EU/US trade sanctions on the Russian economy (visitors from Russia, Turkey's second-largest tourist market, fell by 18.5%) and perceived security concerns following a spate of terrorist attacks in the second half of the year. In 2016 tourism was hit hard by Russian sanctions, which have now been lifted, and by terrorist attacks. Ministry of Culture and Tourism figures put the total number of foreign visitor arrivals in 2016 at 25.4m, a year-on-year fall of 30%. In 2017 the number of foreign visitors increased by 27.8% to 32.4m as visitors from Russia rose to 4.7m, from just 866,000 in 2016 (when bilateral relations hit a low point and Russia imposed sanctions on Turkey), exceeding the level in 2015. Visitors from other European countries remained unchanged from 2016 levels, however, when the number plummeted by 31.1% to 13.2m, from 19.1m in 2015. In the first half of 2018 foreign visitor numbers have continued to surge, including from countries such as Germany and the UK, suggesting that security concerns are no longer deterring visitors from those key markets. The pronounced depreciation of the lira will contribute to robust growth in tourism inflows in the coming quarters.
Economic forecast: Inflation
% 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Consumer prices (av) 11.1 15.5 14.5 8.3 7.1 6.8
Consumer prices (year-end) 11.9 17.7 11.2 7.7 6.9 6.7

Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.9 4.0 4.0 4.8 5.1 5.5
Prior to the lira's crash in 2018, inflation was already stubbornly high and well above the central bank's official 5% medium-term target; it averaged 11.1% in 2017. In 2018 the lira's collapse and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to 17.9% year on year in August. The pass-through of past lira depreciation and higher inflation expectations will keep inflation elevated through the remainder of 2018, to an annual average of 15.5%. In 2019 we expect inflationary pressures to moderate on the back of a modest appreciation of the lira against the US dollar, declining global oil prices and the appearance of spare capacity. We forecast inflation of 14.5% in that year.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 8.3%, as global commodity prices drop owing to a slowdown in the US business cycle and the exchange rate remains broadly stable in nominal terms against the US dollar. Thereafter, in the final two years of our forecast period, we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of 7%-still above the central bank's medium-term target. Although economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures), an expected pick-up in global oil prices and a depreciation of the lira will maintain upward pressure on prices.

Purchasing power parity TL:US$ (av) 1.41 1.54 1.70 1.82 1.91 1.99
In 2017 the lira depreciated by an average of 18% against the US dollar. In 2018 we expect an average depreciation of about 30% (in nominal terms). Our baseline scenario is that the lira is likely to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in the remainder of the year, but that no further major currency collapse will take place. This short-term forecast is underpinned by the real GDP contraction on a quarterly basis in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and its effects on medium-term inflation expectations, which will gradually decline.
In 2019, as inflation moderates and the economy rebounds, we expect the currency to appreciate and the exchange rate to reach TL5.6:US$ by the end of the year. We expect most of the appreciation to happen by early 2020, and as nominal interest rates are lowered the exchange rate will stabilise at about TL5.6:US$1. In 2021-22 relatively high inflation rates as well as a suboptimal policy and political environment will keep the lira on a depreciating path. We forecast that the lira will reach TL5.99:US$1 by the end of 2022.

The current-account deficit as a share of GDP will narrow in 2018, to 5.2% of GDP, from 5.6% of GDP in 2017, owing to the weaker currency and slower average economic growth. We have equally revised our medium-term forecast in all years and now expect a smaller average current-account deficit of 3.3% of GDP per year in 2019-22, compared with our previous forecast of 4.7% of GDP. Significant gains in competitiveness from past lira depreciation (even with the appreciation of the lira in 2019), moderating inflation and the emergence of spare capacity will result in a boost to exports and in import compression over the medium term.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Turkey
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose dramatically in 2005-08, to 2.9% of GDP, after averaging a modest 0.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004. In the context of the global economic and financial crisis, they slowed again in 2009-10 and have remained below the average level of 3.2% of GDP reached in 2006-08. Inflows of FDI, including sales of real estate to non-residents, declined to about US$13.4bn, or 1.5% of GDP, per year in 2012-14, before picking up to about US$18bn, or 2% of GDP, in 2015. In 2016-17 FDI inflows fell to an average of US$12.1bn, or 1.4% of GDP. With FDI inflows amounting to just US$4.9 in the first half of 2018, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the full-year figure to be slightly below that in 2017. Similarly, in 2019 we expect FDI inflows to be subdued owing to high economic and policy uncertainty. In 2020-22 we expect a gradual recovery in inflows as the economy strengthens and some delayed privatisations get under way. The stock of inward FDI stood at just 21.3% of GDP in 2017. Following a fall from US$4.1bn in 2012 to US$3.6bn in 2013, Turkish outward FDI jumped to US$7bn in 2014, largely reflecting a small number of large transactions, notably the acquisition of the UK-based United Biscuits by Yildiz Holding, a Turkish conglomerate of food manufacturers. The figure has gradually eased, falling to US$2.7bn in 2017, presumably given the high domestic funding needs and divestment by foreign firms due to greater economic and policy uncertainty. We expect outflows to remain subdued in 2018-19 and to pick up only thereafter, although to levels below those of 2012-15.
Origin and distribution
The traditional sources of foreign capital in Turkey have been multinational companies based in major EU countries, especially the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and France, and in other OECD countries such as the US, Switzerland and Japan. Individual large investments from several smaller EU countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Brazil have amended this pattern in recent years, and there have also been some significant purchases by private equity funds. A majority of foreign investment appears to go to Istanbul, the main Turkish city where most national Turkish companies have their headquarters. Investment projects of foreign capital companies are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Marmara region (which includes Istanbul), the Aegean region, the Mediterranean and Ankara, the capital. Historically, manufacturing (particularly the chemicals, food and automotive industries) and financial services attracted the most FDI. In 2012 construction figured prominently, with about 13% of net FDI inflows, although this was the result of the inclusion in this category of a single investment by the French-based Aéroports de Paris, which bought a 38% stake in Turkey's airport operator; TAV Airports; and a 49% stake in its construction arm, TAV Construction. In 2015 the share of FDI of financial services rose sharply, to 30% of the total, from about 17% in the previous year; this again reflected the impact of a single large investment in which a Spanish bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), increased its stake in Garanti Bank. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals was the second-largest category in 2015, accounting for 15% of total FDI inflows. Problems in developed economies, and the euro zone crisis in particular, together with the more recent deterioration in economic prospects in Turkey, has led to divestments by foreign financial institutions, many of which entered the Turkish market in 2005-08. As part of a plan to shore up its capital base, the National Bank of Greece has sold its 99.8% stake in Finans Bank, but because the sale, which was completed in mid-2016, was to Qatar National Bank, it did not affect net inward FDI figures in 2016. In 2017 OMV, an Austrian energy group, sold off its 100% stake in Petrol Ofisi, a Turkish petrol retailer.
Foreign property purchases, which are included in balance-of-payments statistics for FDI, have been making a solid contribution to net inflows since 2005. In 2005-13 net inflows averaged a solid US$2.5bn per year, before picking up to an average of US$4.3bn in 2014-17. In view of the excess supply and the deteriorating economic outlook, real estate inflows are likely to decline in 2018-19.
Determinants
Foreign investment is mostly motivated by the size and potential of the Turkish market, but also increasingly because it offers access to neighbouring markets. The sharp rise in FDI in 2005-07 was partly driven by favourable global financial conditions, which have since evaporated. However, the upsurge was also made possible by the conjunction of several country-specific factors. The 2001 financial crisis led to a new drive for reform and privatisation, and reforms in sectors such as energy, telecommunications and banking began to take hold. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), in power since 2002, was more willing than its predecessors to sell majority stakes in state-owned companies to foreigners, even in sectors previously considered "strategic". The economy was relatively stable and grew strongly, and EU accession talks, which were expected to lead to further reform of the business environment, got under way. The private sector was also more willing to seek foreign partners than in the past. This may have reflected the thinking of a new generation of management, strategies of specialisation in certain sectors, a desire to raise capital for privatisation bids, fear of increasing foreign competition, lost appetite for bank ownership and temptingly high company valuations. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an attempted military coup in July 2016 and the shift to a presidential system of government. Other significant structural deterrents, which vary by the sector, size and type of investment, include regulatory uncertainty, a slow and unpredictable judicial system, weak intellectual property (IP) protection and unfair competition from smuggled goods and the informal sector.
Impact
The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is relatively low when compared with other emerging markets such as Brazil or Russia. However, FDI has accumulated over many decades, and the outlook compared with several central and east European countries has improved. Several leading multinationals, such as Unilever and Ford, have had a long-standing presence in Turkey, and companies with foreign partners play a significant role in the economy, helping to spread modern management and business practice. In the automotive industry, foreign investment has ensured expansion, technology transfer and access to global markets, although some lament the lack of national technology or a national trademark and the focus on production of low-end vehicles. By contrast, much recent FDI has taken the form of acquisitions of existing assets in domestically oriented sectors, and has therefore had a limited direct impact on fixed investment or exports. Foreign ownership of banks has not demonstrably improved either access to international funds or services and productivity, which were already advanced, and nor have fears been realised that foreign-owned banks may attach a greater risk premium than local banks to lending to the Turkish government or Turkish companies. The arrival of Vodafone has gradually helped to increase competition and investment in telecoms, where Turkcell and Turk Telekom are dominant players. From a macroeconomic perspective, Turkey has relied on capital inflows, including FDI, to cover its large external financing requirement. In the years prior to the 2008-09 crisis, a growing share of FDI in capital inflows comforted the financial markets by reducing the vulnerability of the lira to trends in short-term capital inflows. After having declined in recent years, we expect the ratio to improve during the forecast period.
Potential
Our baseline forecast is that, assuming security and policy concerns are addressed during the forecast period, there will be a moderate pick-up driven by further privatisation and other crossborder mergers and acquisitions, as well as foreign interest in residential and commercial property, following the easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in 2012. Although the surge in foreign acquisitions in telecoms and banking of 2006-07 is unrepeatable, private corporations in many sectors may still be open to foreign investment, and several major assets remain to be privatised. We assume that the government will make further progress in creating conditions for private-sector investment in infrastructure. The energy sector in particular has the potential to attract large amounts of foreign investment. Existing investors are likely to increase their investment through further acquisitions or projects, and some greenfield investment may take place. Subdued income growth may dampen foreign investors' earlier interest in retailing, but they may also become more active in other services, such as tourism, as well as in mining and agriculture. Investors from Asia may play a larger role, in addition to Western multinationals and funds.

Population growth remains high by European standards
Turkey is the third-largest country by population in Europe, after Russia and Germany. Official population figures have been compiled using an address-based registry since 2009. These figures are lower than previous estimates from door-to-door censuses, but are believed to be more reliable. The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 80.7m in 2017 to 85m in 2022, with the female population continuing to outnumber that of males. The total population is expected to grow by about 1% per year during the forecast period (2018-22), compared with 1.6% during the historical period (2013-17). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of urbanisation, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards.
From an average of 17.3 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2013-17, the crude birth rate is expected to fall to an average of 15.8 per 1,000 in 2018-22. The infant mortality rate will continue to decline, but will remain high compared with European countries, as the national average is pulled up by the south-eastern and eastern regions, as well as by rural areas. The crude death rate will remain broadly unchanged, at an average of 5.9 per 1,000 population in 2018-22.
Although ageing, the Turkish population is young in a European context, and will remain so throughout the forecast period. In 2017 those aged 14 and under were estimated to comprise 25% of the population, and the 65-plus age group accounted for just 8.2%. In 2022 the share of under-15s will still be high, at about 23.1% of the population, and the over-65s are expected to account for 9.4%.
The urban population, which is currently estimated at 74.4%, will rise further as rural families, insufficiently supported by agriculture, continue to seek better living standards in towns and cities. The drift of population from smaller and poorer urban settlements to larger and richer ones will also continue. As a result, all major cities in the west and south (including Ankara) will continue to grow rapidly. Although earthquake-prone, Istanbul and its surrounding area is likely to become the largest conurbation in Europe-the population was already 15m at end-2017, up from about 11m at end-2007. Other cities and towns to witness particularly strong population growth include prosperous industrial centres like Bursa and Konya, and Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast.
The population of the mostly Kurdish-inhabited south east, which accounts for about 10% of the total population, has increased steadily, despite strong outward migration. The still-high natural population growth rate in the region will contribute to the rapid expansion of the populations of cities like Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. By contrast, the populations of many rural areas in northern, eastern and central Turkey will dwindle. Even some of the larger urban centres in these poorer and more remote regions could lose population as birth rates slow and migration westwards and southwards continues. Some western and southern areas that are still classed as rural may maintain their populations as a result of intensive agriculture, tourism and/or proximity to major cities. This may also be true of lowland parts of the south east benefiting from irrigation schemes.
Participation rates will remain well below the OECD average
Despite solid growth in the working-age population, Turkey has the lowest labour force participation rate of any OECD country. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), it averaged 52.8% in 2017 (72.5% for men, and just over 33.5% for women) compared with an OECD average rate of more than 70%. Participation rates in urban areas are lower than in rural areas, reflecting that rural women are typically classified as "unpaid family workers" and are, therefore, counted as workforce participants and employed persons. Low workforce participation rates among urban women probably reflect inadequate job opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender roles. This situation is changing slowly, as illustrated by a gradual rise in recent years in the urban female participation rate. However, the rate is expected to remain low by European standards throughout the forecast period.

The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. In 2017 GDP per head was US$10,503 at market exchange rates and US$27,100 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. Relative to other emerging markets, these figures are broadly in line with those of Russia and well above those of Brazil and China. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Turkey's GDP per head to be about US$32,700 at PPP exchange rates in 2022. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be about 66% of the EU28 average, up from 65% in 2017.
Overall spending power will rise, but income distribution will remain uneven
Income distribution is uneven by European standards. According to the official 2016 (latest available) survey of incomes and living conditions, members of the highest-earning 20% of households accounted for 47.2% of total income, up from 45.9% in 2014, and the members of the lowest-earning 20% of households for 6.2%, in line with the 2014 figure. Geographical factors contributed to the discrepancies. In general, the regions with the highest and most rapidly growing concentrations of population were also the wealthiest regions-except in the south east, where spending power is low. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), greater Istanbul, which accounts for about one-fifth of the population, represents about one-quarter of household consumption expenditure. By contrast, the statistical region of south-east Anatolia, with about 10% of the population, generated only about 6% of household consumption. Income and consumer expenditure also vary widely between urban and rural areas, and within cities. These patterns are unlikely to change significantly in the forecast period (2018-22).
The household will remain the main consumption unit during the forecast period. Households typically consist of an average 3.4 people, and more than 90% of households are made up of married couples. Although these patterns will change only gradually, the number of households will tend to increase faster than the population, underpinning medium-term demand for housing construction and household durables, including basics like furniture, washing machines and refrigerators.
A large majority of Turkish consumers aspire to "Western style" consumer society, in so far as their incomes permit, although local factors affect lifestyle aspirations. Much of the population adheres to Islamic prohibitions, including on consumption of alcohol. The country has wide variations in geography and climate, which affect diet, leisure activities and demand for certain goods. Choices of entertainment vary between groups with different education levels.

Young population will encourage new products and services
The proportion of total household spending allocated to food, beverages and tobacco is high and not expected to fall much during the forecast period. Housing and household fuel, goods and services will also remain major expenditure items. The wealthiest households, which enjoy standards of living close to those of west Europeans, spend significant amounts on entertainment, education and catering, as well as on transport, because of the high cost of running a car. These households will remain an important target market for environment-friendly and wellness products and services, which are relatively new. Other population segments are starting to provide additional demand for items that have been the prerogative of upper-income groups. Rising car ownership will continue to encourage supermarket shopping, residence in suburban areas and related lifestyle trends. Demand for branded fashion items, fast food, air conditioning and holidays is also spreading. That half of the population is under the age of 30 will encourage the introduction of new products and services in communications, information and entertainment technology. Tourists constitute a significant addition to the consumer market. About 50m, including foreigners and non-resident Turks, visited Turkey in 2014 and 2015. This figure fell to a still sizeable 39m in 2016 (mainly owing to the sharp drop in Russian tourists due to tensions between the two countries in 2015-16), but picked up to 47m in 2017 and is set to continue growing.

Initial conditions: Some of the obstacles to solid and stable growth were removed in the decade to 2010, but in recent years the government has focused on domestic power struggles and the foreign policy challenges arising from turmoil in the wider region, putting economic reforms designed to boost investment and employment on hold. Given the deterioration of Turkey's institutions of governance and the likelihood that the current domestic political tensions will continue for some time, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only limited progress on reforms in the near term, damaging Turkey's longer-term growth potential. For similar reasons, we do not expect Turkey's EU membership bid to make significant progress, making accession a remote prospect. A relatively low level of skills and quality of the workforce compared with Turkey's main competitors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in central and eastern Europe will continue to act as a deterrent to FDI, although Turkey will enjoy substantially more favourable demographics.
Working-age population growth turns negative in 2040
Demographic trends: On current projections, Turkey will have the second-largest national population in Europe, after Russia, by 2050; and unlike in most European economies Turkey's working-age population will continue to grow up to the early 2040s. Nevertheless, Turkey's positive demographic dynamic is expected to start deteriorating from about 2030. In 2031-50 the difference between growth in the working-age population and that of the total population will become negative, which will dampen economic growth. This trend could be delayed if the bulk of 3.1m Syrian refugees currently being hosted in Turkey are integrated into the population.
Throughout the long-term forecast period, we expect an upward trend in the labour force and employment because of rises in participation rates, given the low starting levels. With the workforce continuing to expand at a steady rate, it will be a challenge to produce sufficient jobs to lower the unemployment rate substantially from an annual average of 10.5% in 2018-22.
External conditions: International developments-particularly in international financial markets, the EU (Turkey's main export market) and in global terms of trade-will continue to affect Turkey's long-term economic performance. With export-led industries playing an increasing role in growth, Turkey would benefit from greater global trade liberalisation, but the process of liberalisation is faltering and trade flows have slowed. As a supplier of the developed economies, Turkey will continue to face intense international competition, as low and medium value-added manufactured goods are likely to remain its main product lines. Its technology potential is relatively limited, and the country is not well placed to become a major supplier of services other than tourism and, to a lesser extent, construction, although improvements in (and diversification of) the domestic financial sector over the past decade may enable Turkey to develop as a provider of banking and insurance services in the wider region. Because of completed and planned pipeline construction, Turkey is expected to become a major energy hub between Russia, the Caspian region and western Europe. As Turkey shares borders with countries like Iran, Syria and Iraq, its immediate regional environment is challenging, in particular from a security perspective.
The EU's problems will dampen Turkey's interest in membership
We do not expect Turkey to join the EU, and there is a high probability that the accession negotiations may even be abandoned by one or both sides during the long-term forecast period. Given the limited progress so far in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the strength of public opposition in most EU member states to Turkish membership and the economic and political challenges still facing the EU, we believe that Turkey's commitment to the goal of full EU membership will diminish even further. This increases the risk that government commitment to political and economic reform will weaken further. Harmonisation of Turkey's domestic legislation with EU norms is significantly more important for Turkey's long-term economic stability than actual membership. If the EU were to loosen its structure-the UK's vote to leave the EU could prompt such a move-opposition in the EU to Turkish accession might ease, increasing Turkey's chances of joining. However, this is not our core scenario.
Institutions and policy trends: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's victory in Turkey's first direct election of the president in August 2014, the approval of his presidential reform plan in a referendum in April 2017 and the presidential election of 2018 have shifted the political system from a parliamentary to a presidential system. The shift carries major implications for the country's future institutional and policy-setting framework. The constitutional reform allows Mr Erdogan to run for president for two five-year terms, which means that he is likely to be in power until 2028. Beyond that, assuming that the constitution is not amended further to allow him to run for a third term, which cannot be ruled out, the issue of his succession as leader of the AKP and president of the country could become a source of instability during the long-term forecast period.
The broadly positive management of the economy by the AKP since coming to power in 2002 has been one of the main reasons for its electoral successes. However, there is a considerable risk that economic policy will be increasingly tailored to political purposes rather than to maintain macroeconomic stability and further improvement of the business environment. Nevertheless, Turkey's public finances are structurally sounder following a decade of IMF-backed reforms in 1999-2008, which may allow the government more room to increase public investment in infrastructure and possibly to reduce tax rates further, if solid economic growth is sustained. Given the little progress that we expect to be made in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the problems of unpredictability and inefficiency in Turkey's domestic legal and regulatory environment are expected to continue beyond 2022. Legislation is likely to remain under the scrutiny of the EU and other international bodies, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, although Mr Erdogan's assertive and increasingly personalised approach to foreign relations is likely to limit their influence over the direction of policies.
The government's peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed following the June 2015 election, and neither the PKK nor Mr Erdogan has shown any indication that they are willing to revive it any time soon. If the situation continues on its current trajectory, there is a real risk that the PKK and its affiliates will spread the conflict from the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited south east of the country to Turkey's main cities in central and western regions, where the Kurdish population has grown rapidly in recent years. The mounting death toll will probably encourage Mr Erdogan to resort to increasingly authoritarian means to retain control.
Long-term performance: Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to exceed that of other emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and China as a result of its more favourable demographic profile alongside large productivity increases. However, at an average of 3.1% a year in 2018-50, real GDP growth will be well below that recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU28 average, but catch-up is likely to continue. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but the changes in the political environment have created significant downside risks that the necessary reforms are not implemented.

Climate change and sustainability
Global land and ocean temperatures have been rising briskly since the 1980s, a trend that is widely attributed to growing greenhouse gas emissions from expanding human activity and population. In the coming decades the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East region will be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Energy, Environment and Water Research Centre (EEWRC) of the Cyprus Institute, a non-profit research institute, expects average temperatures in the broad region to increase by 3-5°C by 2050. This is a sharp acceleration in atmospheric warming compared with a 1-2°C rise in average temperatures from 1892 to 2010. This rise in average temperatures implies a higher number of extremely hot days in the summer period, as well as higher minimum temperatures that will lead to greater electricity consumption and a heavier burden on health services due to temperature-related illnesses and parasitic diseases that thrive in warmer climates.
Precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean has been declining steadily over the past decades and is expected to continue falling, raising the probability of extremely dry spells of weather. From 1998 to 2012 the eastern Mediterranean Levant (Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey) experienced the worst drought in 900 years. In Turkey, in 2007 this resulted in water restrictions being imposed in Ankara, the capital, with some residents losing access for up to ten days. It also resulted in Turkey's agricultural output contracting by nearly 7% year on year and the government having to provide grants to affected farmers to compensate for the losses. In the future limited average rainfall is likely to be accompanied by torrential precipitation such as that in the first half of 2018, with devastating consequences for infrastructure and agricultural output.
The Turkish government has recently taken some steps to mitigate the weakness posed by the country's geographical location. In 2010 the government established a national climate change strategy that includes improved disaster mitigation plans and improved efficiency in water management. Specifically, a substantial number of damns have been built, and efforts have been made to improve some of the highly inefficient irrigation and water supply systems. Although such measures may help to mitigate the effects of climate change, they may also create foreign policy challenges. The construction of several damns along the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, which feed water into Iraq and Syria, has the potential to increase significantly tensions with these neighbouring countries.
Technological development
The integration of advanced technologies in Turkey's economy is proceeding at a fast pace, yet from a relatively low base. E-commerce, computer ownership and internet access have increased rapidly in the past decade. Yet despite this progress Turkey remains far behind the technological frontier. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Rankings, Turkey ranks joint 46th with Romania in the global rankings for technological readiness. According to the 2017-18 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2017-18, Turkey ranks 53rd in technological adoption (including in categories such as availability of latest technologies) and 68th in the use of information and communications technology (this includes criteria such as the percentage of internet users).
Across sectors, large, export-oriented private-sector firms tend to be the most technologically intensive. Firms in the automotive sector, usually structured as joint partnerships between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, are a major driver of research and development (R&D) expenditure. Ford Otosan, the joint venture of Ford, a car manufacturer, in Turkey has become a global hub for Ford's commercial vehicle development and output. In 2015 the company opened a US$25m R&D unit-Turkey's largest, employing about 1,500 engineers. Oyak-Renault, a joint venture between Renault, a French car manufacturer, and Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund, won government financial support worth US$100m to support hybrid investments at its Bursa plant.
Turkey's technological prospects are unclear. The country has a young, dynamic labour pool, but Turkey's education system is inadequate at providing the skills demanded by employers. In fact, this is regularly one of businesses' top complaints. In addition, in recent years many of Turkey's most educated young people have emigrated abroad; this will make attracting top foreign talent and further foreign direct investment (FDI) more difficult.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. [...]exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19-especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. Palm oil prices, however, are forecast to weaken as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Cocoa (US cents/lb) 110.6 138.9 142.2 131.1 92.1 107.0 97.3 92.4 92.0 94.0 Coffee (Arabica) (US cents/lb) 139.5 200.7 159.9 163.8 150.7 134.9 149.5 165.8 170.0 175.0 Coffee (Robusta) (US cents/lb) 94.2 100.5 88.1 88.6 100.9 88.6 101.5 106.8 100.0 103.5 Tea (US$/kg) 2.86 2.72 2.71 2.64 3.10 2.93 2.81 2.90 2.85 2.92 Sugar (US cents/lb) 17.7 17.0 13.4 18.1 16.0 12.5 13.6 14.2 15.2 15.5 Barley (US$/tonne) 206.4 146.1 127.9 129.4 138.5 163.4 167.9 172.8 153.9 161.8 Maize (US$/tonne) 264.4 206.0 175.5 168.3 160.9 179.7 187.5 197.5 188.0 192.0 Rice (US$/tonne) 489.5 423.8 386.0 386.0 389.8 405.8 400.0 403.8 430.0 427.0 Sorghum (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 866.1 1,021.8 1,049.4 1,080.1 962.4 1,011.5 Wheat (US$/tonne) 321.5 302.7 232.5 197.5 211.5 249.5 256.3 263.8 235.0 247.0 Soybeans (US$/tonne) 556.5 501.3 379.8 389.8 377.0 367.8 351.3 350.0 388.0 402.0 Soybean oil (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 845.8 796.3 760.6 757.9 840.2 840.2 Soymeal (US$/tonne) 545.3 527.9 394.8 379.8 358.6 397.8 389.5 378.6 419.8 419.8 Palm oil (US$/tonne) 856.9 821.4 622.7 700.2 714.7 645.4 590.8 574.3 587.0 580.0 Rapeseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,079.3 907.3 775.3 823.6 869.5 838.5 910.0 876.0 960.0 970.0 Sunflowerseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,124.0 901.8 845.8 840.9 795.7 779.0 804.9 849.9 875.0 903.0 Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Agricultural prices will show a faster than expected recovery in 2018
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that its food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index will rise by 4.4% in 2018, halting a seven-year decline. This is an upward revision from our previous forecast of 3.1% growth, primarily owing to adverse weather conditions affecting wheat production in several countries, as well as rising trade tensions between the US and China. The bilateral trade war has disrupted existing trade patterns and caused the prices of some products that are subject to tariffs, including soybeans and soymeal, to diverge in various markets. A number of other markets, including grains such as rice, are also beginning to tighten slightly, which will support sustained price growth. Nonetheless, supplies in most markets remain comfortable by historical standards; several crops registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. The downside risks related to expectations of a La Niña weather phenomenon appear to have largely passed. We expect the FFB index to rise again in 2019, by 1.7%, as some markets tighten further, causing prices for goods such as coffee and maize to recover. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) in the FFB sector in the medium and long term.
FFB prices will rise again in 2019, and risks to the forecast remain mixed
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw on. We expect global GDP growth to remain fairly robust at an average of 2.9% per year in 2018-19, roughly on a par with 2017. However, uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19-especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. This will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further contributing to global supplies.
Grain prices will register strong gains in 2018
We forecast that grain prices will rise by 15.7% in 2018. Maize prices rose by about 10% on average in February in response to worries about drought and rapidly shrinking production prospects in Argentina. However, as other crops come to the market and carryover supplies from the bumper 2016/17 crop remain available, we expect full-year maize price growth to average 8% per year in 2018-19. For wheat, adverse weather conditions are affecting yields across the world, changing the supply outlook significantly. As global demand growth remains strong, we expect the market to register a deficit in 2017/18. Overall, we expect wheat prices to surge ahead by 18% year on year in 2018 (from 12.6% previously) and by a further 3% in 2019 (from a decline of 0.8% previously).
Oilseed prices will fall in 2018-19
Oilseed prices fell by 1.6% in 2017, largely owing to the bumper soybean crop in major producers such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stockpiles higher. We expect soybean prices to decline by an average of 5.2% per year in 2018-19. China's imposition in July of a 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US has created the potential for greater price volatility; for now, however, we expect China to source imports from other suppliers, avoiding a sharp increase in prices. Sunflowerseed oil prices are likely to remain fairly flat in 2018-19, reflecting comfortable supplies. Palm oil prices, however, are forecast to weaken as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We expect the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee, cocoa and tea, to fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We forecast cocoa prices to rise by 16.2% in 2018, before declining by 9.1% in 2019; however, this will do little to erase the massive drop in 2017 of nearly 30%, which was caused by soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices (arabica) are forecast to fall by 10.5% in 2018 on the back of higher than expected production from Central America as well as the comparative strength of the US dollar, which will encourage exporters to sell their stocks. In 2019 we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to rebound by 10.8%, as several consecutive years of market deficits begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2019
Sugar prices declined by 11.3% in 2017, reflecting a market correction after a price spike in late 2016 related to fears that supply from Thailand would be heavily affected by poor weather conditions. We now expect sugar prices to fall by 21.8% in 2018, as crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets are fuelling expectations of a larger global sugar surplus than we had previously anticipated. Policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably China, India and the EU) have weakened market sentiment further. However, we expect supplies to begin to tighten in 2019 as higher ethanol prices encourage farmers to divert more cane to ethanol (rather than to its rival, sugar). This should support growth in global sugar prices of nearly 8.3% year on year in 2019.

Cocoa
Demand
Data from the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) show that global cocoa consumption rose by 2.4% in the 2016/17 season, following two consecutive years of decline in consumption. Although cocoa consumption in the world's largest consumers (mainly developed economies, as well as some large markets in the developing world) is now positive after contracting in 2015/16, consumption growth is weak in many of these countries, at less than 1%. By contrast, cocoa consumption growth will prove stronger in other, smaller cocoa consumers, which will drive growth in global cocoa consumption. This group of "other" countries now accounts for over 31% of world cocoa consumption, up from less than 25% in 2005/06. By region, Asia accounts for much of this increase, although rising demand in the Americas and Europe has also contributed. Assuming that this trend continues, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects continued moderate growth in global cocoa consumption, averaging 1.5% per year in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Consumption in major developed markets will be weaker, as already high per-capita consumption levels will prevent faster demand growth. Other factors precluding more rapid growth in global cocoa demand include retail prices, which may rise in response to the increase in global cocoa prices in recent months, potentially pushing some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. Meanwhile, the size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity, but also to protect profits against a background of rising cocoa prices in previous years-which will also hamper consumption growth.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in developed economies. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounted for 27% of the world's imports of cocoa powder in 2016/17, compared with just 11% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to lift demand for powder.
Consumption growth will remain fairly low in more saturated markets
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2017/18-2018/19. Health concerns, market saturation and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping is eroding spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases). However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption. Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for 18% of global demand) and in European countries, which collectively account for 46% of global demand, are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate with a higher cocoa content, but with less frequent purchases.
Cocoa consumption growth will remain firm in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels of just 35 g in India and 62 g in China in 2016/17, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets. However, demand will be hampered by high retail prices. Chinese demand will continue to rise firmly, at a rate of around 5.2% per year in 2017/18-2018/19 on the back of a relatively firm GDP growth forecast. In India, we expect demand growth to pick up from 1.3% in 2016/17 to an annual average of 2.6% per year during the forecast period.

a October-September; domestic grindings and net imports.
Supply
Data from the ICCO show that global cocoa production surged by 18.7% in 2016/17, reflecting improved weather conditions after a particularly difficult El Niño weather event and a severe harmattan season (a dry winter wind blowing from the Sahara) had cut African cocoa output in 2015/16 in many of the continent's main producers. We expect cocoa production to fall by 6.9% in 2017/18 and by 2.6% in 2018/19, reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively the world's largest and second-largest cocoa producers. Although output in both countries will remain high by historical standards, lower farm-gate prices, weaker confidence among growers and adverse weather conditions-in 2017/18 at least-will drag down cocoa output. Notwithstanding a rise in prices in 2018, the previous long-running period of weak prices is likely to have dissuaded farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticides, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production.
Structural and geographical factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farm-gate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa, but farmers are also getting a much smaller share of the final retail price than in previous decades owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. In West Africa, for example, many farmers remain below the poverty line, and as a result few young people are choosing to work in the cocoa sector. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to attract new workers, but it is uncertain how effective this will be in the long term.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can only be grown in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) under warm and humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Periodically, there is speculation that climate change will hamper production in these countries to such an extent that cocoa production will plummet. However, we believe that some countries have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of grinding facilities in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production is set to drop in 2017/18 and 2018/19
In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa production jumped by nearly 28% in 2016/17 to a record of just over 2m tonnes. This record is unlikely to be maintained, with cocoa output expected to fall by 7.4% year on year in 2017/18. The projected decline is larger than the year-to-date fall in port arrivals (the amount of cocoa arriving at ports to be exported fell by 3% between October 2017 and mid-July 2018). This reflects the fact that output from the mid-year-crop that is currently being harvested is likely to be significantly lower than last year's production; the mid-year-crop in 2016/17 yielded 520,000 tonnes of cocoa, while this year's production is only likely to reach 400,000 tonnes as a result of the recent dry weather.
We expect production to fall again in 2018/19, by a more modest 3.7%, reflecting a relatively unsupportive domestic policy backdrop. Not only has the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC), issued fewer export licences, but plans to accelerate the replacement of old crops infected by swollen shoot virus (which cuts yields) with new crops over the course of the next three years will hamper production. In addition, the CCC has kept farm-gate prices on hold for the 2017/18 harvest, with price levels around one-third lower than in the previous year. This has discouraged the use of fertiliser and pesticides, with the incidence of crop disease rising as a result. Even if farm-gate prices were raised-which is unlikely now that global cocoa prices are falling-it is doubtful whether this would come soon enough to impact output trends for the 2018/19 harvest. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from price volatility, but the amounts have been insufficient, and given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC, neither farmers nor exporters are confident that losses arising from low global prices in 2016/17 will be recouped.
Ghanaian production is set to decline in both 2017/18 and 2018/19
Similar production trends are evident in Ghana. Cocoa production rebounded firmly in 2016/17, lifted by favourable weather and a mild harmattan season to 970,000 tonnes (well above the official target of 800,000 tonnes). However, adverse weather and a difficult policy backdrop are hampering production prospects for 2017/18. The cocoa authority, Cocobod, is encountering financial problems that are likely to affect the amount paid to farmers and in turn depress output. Cocobod was forced to seek a bridging loan from Bank of Ghana (the central bank) last year, and following the recent depletion of a stabilisation fund and indications that it may take on more debt this year, Cocobod has announced that it is considering amending the way in which farmers are paid. This is likely to involve the removal of a scheme that pays subsidies to farmers (guaranteeing a minimum income level). The authorities are instead considering a scheme in which farmers are paid 70% of the cocoa export price, which would expose incomes to considerable market volatility.
Given anxiety among farmers about the government's intentions to prioritise other crops over cocoa, the ongoing encroachment by gold miners, the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser and the fact that around one-fifth of trees are affected by swollen shoot disease, production is forecast to fall by 17.5% in 2017/18 and by 2.5% in 2018/19. In light of a recent statement by the authorities that output could be as low as 700,000 tonnes in 2017/18 (implying a drop of nearly 28%), risks to our forecast are to the downside.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally 3-5 years). The authorities aim ultimately to raise production significantly, with Cocobod recently indicating that they are targeting output of 1m tonnes within the next five years (an apparent downgrade from previous statements of a target of 1.5m tonnes within four years), driven by better soil management, pest and disease control and improved irrigation. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (estimated at 40% by Cocobod) and consequently a low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). However, it will be difficult to secure the necessary funding. We think it is unlikely that these ambitious plans will come to fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment and external creditors are unlikely to fund the project.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
After recovering to 246,000 tonnes in 2016/17, Cameroon's production is forecast to weaken during 2018-19. Cuts in farm-gate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". Ongoing political unrest in the south-west of the country, which produces around half of Cameroon's output, will also drag down national cocoa production, as rising numbers of farmers are reported to have fled their plantations in the wake of violent clashes between separatists and the security forces. Plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year are highly unlikely to materialise in this context. We expect production to fall by 9.3% in 2017/18 and by a further 3.6% in 2018/19, representing a downgrade from our previous forecast of declines of 8.5% and 1.3%, respectively.
Cocoa production has slumped in Nigeria in recent years as government initiatives meant to support farmers-including efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and to increase the distribution of free seedlings-have not been successful. The authorities have been seeking investment to raise cocoa production, thus diversifying and expanding sources of foreign-exchange earnings beyond the mainstay of oil, with the Ministry of Agriculture recently stating that it believes Nigeria can boost cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. Its short-term goal is to lift cocoa production to 300,000-320,000 tonnes in 2017/18, with the medium-term target of raising output to 1m tonnes/year. However, investment has been slow to materialise, and reports of the dieback fungal disease in the south-west of the country-affecting trees that account for 10% of national output-will hamper production in 2017/18. This will be partly offset by favourable weather in recent months, which reportedly boosted production in the April-June mid-crop. On balance, we envisage a 1.2% increase in cocoa output in 2017/18, but structural problems with weak infrastructure, corruption, poor and expensive access to financing along with weak implementation remain unaddressed and are likely to prompt a 2.4% decline in production in 2018/19.
Production is set to recover slowly in Indonesia
Indonesia is one of the few major cocoa producers that are likely to see output rising firmly during the forecast period. Adverse weather hampered both the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 harvest, with cocoa output registering its third consecutive annual decline in 2016/17. Assuming more stable weather conditions, cocoa output should resume growth, but at a forecast 320,000 tonnes in 2018/19 it will remain weak by historical standards. The authorities have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these targets are unlikely to materialise. Indonesian firms will probably rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from nearby Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America will not be realised in 2018-19
The agricultural sectors of Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, were affected by El Niño in 2015/16, but with better weather conditions they rebounded firmly in 2016/17. Structurally, there is scope for both countries to lift output as manufacturers look to develop production centres outside West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. However, some of this investment will be slow to materialise, which will hold back recent output growth.

Stocks and prices
We expect the surplus in the global cocoa market to narrow sharply, from 612,000 tonnes in 2016/17 to 50,000 tonnes by 2018/19. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that we continue to forecast a market surplus, despite signs of firmer demand growth. Stocks are forecast to reach around 2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season. Although this is high by historical standards, the relatively gloomy production outlook is likely to bolster prices.

Ample global cocoa supplies will put downward pressure on prices in 2019
Cocoa prices traded at comparatively low levels between February 2017 and February 2018, mainly in the range of US$1,950/tonne and US$2,050/tonne. However, prices rose sharply in March-May, to US$2,600-2,700/tonne, on the back of gloomy prospects for production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Better weather conditions subsequently led to a reduction in prices to an average of around US$2,370/tonne in July, with futures prices also edging downwards (trading at just under US$2,300/tonne in late July). Although we forecast a gradual moderation in prices, we expect average quarterly prices to remain above US$2,300/tonne for the remainder of the year. Our full-year average price forecast, at US$2,358/tonne, implies a 16.2% year-on-year increase. However, we then expect prices to fall back by 9% in 2018, to an average of US$2,145/tonne.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption expanded by around 2.5% on average in 2015/16 and 2016/17 (October-September crop years), largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries-mainly developed economies-which account for two-thirds of global demand. Indeed, data for coffee consumption in the EU and US in 2016/17 indicate that these regions accounted for over 70% of the global increase in consumption during that crop year. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth in global coffee demand to accelerate to 3.8% in 2017/18, marking the strongest pace of growth since 2011/12, aided by stronger underlying economic conditions in many of the large consuming markets, before easing to 2.8% in 2018/19.
Notwithstanding a likely acceleration in monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers, overall domestic demand is expected to remain firm, supporting coffee consumption. In coffee-exporting countries, many of which are emerging markets, consumption growth will be lower, averaging 2.5% per year. Tepid demand growth in Brazil, which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption owing to the sheer size of its domestic market, is the main factor contributing to weak overall growth in coffee consumption among coffee exporters. Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China, whose economy will continue to grow firmly. However, per-capita coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global growth (China will account for only 3% of the total global rise in coffee production in 2017/18-2018/19).
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America (with 46% of coffee in the US now consumed out of the home) and Europe (which saw the number of coffee shops rise by 6.4% in 2017), but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets, as well as the spread of coffee delivery services by large chains. In some markets-including the US and China-large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by the heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although accounting for only a small share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee-pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that in volume terms the instant- and ground-coffee market remains larger. Despite the sharp slowdown in sales of machines and capsules after initial firm growth, the coffee-pod market will continue to provide important support for overall demand of arabica coffee (most pods contain predominantly arabica beans).
Coffee consumption growth in North America will increase steadily
We expect US coffee consumption growth to accelerate from 4.2% in 2016/17 to an average of 4.4% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. Aside from solid underlying economic growth, data from the US National Coffee Association show that the percentage of people drinking coffee is rising rapidly (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017, according to the latest data). Daily consumption is rising, and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products; for example, US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over 2015-17. Moreover, the number of coffee shops is increasing at a rate of around 3.6% per year, while the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee has gone up from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017. Demand growth among 18-24-year-olds is also rising strongly, suggesting that the recent firm growth in coffee consumption is likely to continue in the medium to long term.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers, in particular, are showing a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations. We expect Canada's demand growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to pick up slightly, to an average of 2.7% in 2017/18-2018/19.
Coffee consumption in Brazil is expected to recover
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. However, a sharp economic recession in 2015-17 caused coffee consumption to remain fairly flat in recent years, after firm growth in 2005-15. We expect coffee consumption growth to recover in 2017/18-2018/19, but at a fairly moderate pace of 1.2% per year on average. Although the local coffee processing association, ABIC, is projecting coffee consumption growth of 3.6% in 2018 as economic growth is recovering, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment and rising fuel prices, which will all act as a drag on disposable income.
Continued coffee consumption growth is forecast in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia, with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by 1.5% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption to growth to rise by an average of 1.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. The slower pace of growth will reflect slightly weaker underlying economic conditions after a comparatively rapid pace of economic growth in 2017, as well as a fall in the number of coffee shops. Meanwhile, in South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with imports more than trebling in the past decade and the number of coffee shops increasing even faster. We expect the pace of growth to remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 3.1%.
China consumption and production data
Until recently we have not included China in our list of top coffee consumers and producers, instead including it in our list of "others". This reflects the fact that the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) does not report China's coffee consumption and production, complicating direct data comparisons with other consuming and producing countries. Widespread acknowledgment of China emerging as a major player in the coffee market has prompted us to amend our tables to include figures for China. However, a lack of historical data series means that these figures should be regarded as estimates.
Consumption
We have based the historical series of our coffee consumption data on a paper written by the ICO, in which it estimates consumption based on production, export and import figures. It provides data to 2013/14, with annual consumption calculated from domestic production plus net exports. From 2013/14 onwards we have estimated coffee consumption based on growth in private consumption to provide a rough guide to the size of the Chinese coffee market. According to these calculations, China is the sixth-largest coffee consumer among coffee-exporting countries, but at 2.4m bags in 2016/17 its market is significantly smaller than those of many coffee-importing countries. By comparison, Chinese coffee consumption remains lower than consumption in the UK, despite huge disparities in population size.
Production
We have used data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which are current until 2016/17. This series indicates that coffee production rose sharply between 2008/09 and 2013/14, more than trebling, but output has since stabilised at around 1.9m bags. This makes China the world's tenth-largest coffee producer.

Demand in China and India will continue to grow
Coffee demand in China and India, which have similar levels of consumption, will continue to grow, aided by still-firm economic growth in both countries, which will lift disposable incomes. Although GDP growth is likely to be stronger in India, we expect coffee consumption growth in China to be much firmer. This reflects the fact that the middle class has expanded much more rapidly in China than in India, where disposable income levels for the most part remain extremely low. The emergence of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres is a key factor contributing to the rise in coffee consumption in China, aided by a rapid expansion of international coffee chains. Starbucks now runs 3,200 outlets in 139 Chinese cities, up from 2,300 in October 2017. Of these, around 600 are in Shanghai alone-Starbucks' largest presence in a single city. A new store which opened in the city last December, the Shanghai Reserve Roastery, is the company's highest-earning branch worldwide. Despite signs of weaker sales growth in China amid growing competition, the company is still planning to have 6,000 stores open by the end of 2022. With the out-of-home sector expanding much less rapidly in India, coffee consumption will grow more slowly. We forecast average growth of 2.2% per year in 2017/18-2018/19.
South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in some countries, mainly in coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia and opened its first store in Vietnam last October.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee (which generally use the robusta variety) in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.
Supply
After rising by 3.7% in the 2016/17 crop year, reflecting firm output growth in Brazil, the world's largest producer, overall coffee production is forecast to drop by 0.9% in 2017/18. This mainly reflects a forecast decline in Brazilian pro-duction as the biennial crop alternates between higher- and lower-producing years (2017/18 is an "off-season" crop year), but production is also set to fall in several other main producers, including Indonesia and Colombia. However, this will be partially offset by rising output in Mexico and Central America, as well as in Africa. The recent La Niña weather phenomenon (a severe episode that can disrupt coffee output by bringing heavy rains to many of Asia's coffee producers and drought to the main Latin American growers) appears to have ended after a short-lived and mild episode, removing the risk of a sharper drop in coffee production in 2017/18. Global production growth is forecast to be much stronger in 2018/19, at 5.8%, as Brazil shifts to an "on-season" year.
Annual coffee production in Brazil is expected to remain well over 50m bags
In Brazil, production is likely to fall in 2017/18 as the crop rotates to an off-season year. Nonetheless, prospects are fairly strong, and we forecast only a modest decline of 5.5%, to 52m bags. This is higher than projections from Conab, the government's crop supply agency, but official forecasts usually prove conservative. Our forecast remains similar to local private-sector expectations and to that of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although adverse weather in mid-2016-including drought in some areas and irregular rainfall in others-raised concerns that beans might be damaged ahead of the harvest, the weather has improved in the meantime, and both the quality and the quantity of beans have been good. Moreover, the still-weak local currency continues to provide an incentive to growers. Problems at some ports have hampered export capacity, but this is unlikely to have a major impact on overall supply.
Output projections for the 2018/19 crop year remain speculative. Although some arabica-producing areas reported dryness earlier in 2018-delaying harvest progress-recent weather conditions have improved. Local observers have stated that there is potential for a bumper crop in 2018/19, with some even suggesting that output of up to 65m bags is possible, which would be a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). We believe that this figure is out of reach and are forecasting coffee production of 58.5m bags for the 2018/19 season. This is above Conab's forecast of 58m bags and the 57.1m bags projected by the government statistics agency, but below the recently published projection by the USDA of 60.2m bags. The strong result is likely to reflect a firm recovery in both arabica and robusta production (which are expected to account for three-quarters and one-quarter of total output, respectively).
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to recover from a severe drought
In Vietnam, the worst drought in three decades hampered production in 2016/17, with output dropping by 11.1%. However, weather conditions stabilised for the 2017/18 crop, which should support a 9.6% increase in coffee production, based on firm export data. This reflects an upgrade from our previous forecast of 8.5%, reflecting strong export volume growth of 10% year on year in the first three quarters of 2017/18. We then expect growth to moderate to 1.1% in the 2018/19 season. The authorities remain pessimistic about the medium-term prospects for production, forecasting coffee output to stabilise or decline slightly. However, recent weather conditions have been supportive, indicating the potential for further production growth in 2018/19. In addition, government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop will support firmer output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically higher. Firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will also encourage growers.
Output from Mexico and Central America will continue to rise in 2017/18
Coffee production rebounded strongly in Mexico and Central America in 2016/17, rising by 19.6% year on year to 19.6m bags. This was in the wake of a severe outbreak of coffee rust followed by an El Niño weather phenomenon, which had damaged plantations in the three previous seasons. Rising coffee output in most of the rest of the sub-region will contribute to a continued rise in output in 2017/18, at a forecast rate of 3.7%. Recent purchases of fungicides and fertiliser will also provide support. We expect coffee production in the sub-region to fall by 1% in 2018/19, mainly reflecting a fall in output in Honduras as well as stagnant output in some other countries, including Guatemala owing to a volcanic eruption in the south-west of the country in early June, which is believed to have wiped out 1% of the country's coffee plantations.
Colombian production is set to fall in 2017/18 but recover in 2018/19
Coffee production in Colombia has risen steadily in recent years, reaching a 24-year high of 14.6m bags in 2016/17. Prospects for 2017/18 are weaker. Cloudy weather conditions affected flowering on coffee bushes early in the season, which was followed more recently by very wet weather, prompting a 2.6% fall in coffee production in October 2017-June 2018. We are forecasting a 2.3% drop in coffee production in the full 2017/18 crop year. However, the sector's fundamentals are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes. In addition, recent additional planting in existing plantations has focused on improving yields, which at 18 bags/ha in 2016 were much lower than in other large growers (27 bags/ha in Brazil and 35 bags/ha in Vietnam). As a result we expect production to recover in 2018/19, with output growing by 2.8% that season to 14.7m bags. In the medium term the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the then FARC rebels will allow coffee cultivation to expand in previously isolated areas of the country (the government has said that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as a result).
Coffee production is likely to remain weak in Indonesia
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector, which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil, have been completely derailed. El Niño brought excessive dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the 2016/17 harvest, when output fell by 6.7%. With recent export data indicating that production has dropped sharply so far in 2017/18, we expect output to fall by 15.6% during the full crop year. Even assuming a 9.3% increase in 2018/19, at just 10.6m bags output will remain low by historical standards. Low average yields-at only around one-fifth of the levels of Vietnam-reflect high levels of structural inefficiency in the sector, which we do not expect to be tackled during the forecast period.

Production prospects in Africa, which accounts for around 11% of total global coffee output, are relatively bright. Many of the continent's coffee producers have very low levels of output; together, Ethiopia and Uganda account for 70% of African coffee output. Production rose solidly in both countries in 2016/17, mainly on the back of better weather conditions. Although a fall in robusta production in Uganda is likely to drag down overall production in 2017/18, we expect output to bounce back strongly in 2018/19, reflecting an extensive reseeding programme in recent years, an expansion of the coffee-growing area and domestic efforts to streamline the organisation of the sector. Production is forecast to rise by an annual average of 2.1% in Ethiopia, to 7.6m bags, but this will remain well below the government's extremely ambitious target of 11.7m bags.
Stocks and prices
After rising marginally in 2016/17, we expect global coffee stocks to fall in 2017/18-2018/19 as a market deficit offsets continued sales of stocks, with producers taking advantage of relatively weak local currencies against the US dollar. By end-2018/19 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 26.2m bags (from 33.6m bags in September 2017), which will support a partial recovery in prices.

Coffee prices are increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar
Arabica prices fell steadily over the course of 2017, from an average of US$1.69/lb in January to US$1.37/lb in December. Prices have continued to edge down so far in 2018, falling to US$1.35/lb in March, before slipping below US$1.30/lb in July. Futures prices are trading even lower, with arabica for September delivery standing at under US$1.10/lb in late July. Given that the global market is estimated to have registered its third consecutive annual deficit in 2016/17, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often caused by a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In late 2017 speculation about bumper production levels in Brazil pushed prices lower. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
Speculation about a potential 2018/19 bumper harvest in Brazil and firm output growth in Mexico and Central America is likely to continue to suppress prices in the near term. We expect prices to remain suppressed for at least the remainder of the second and third quarters of 2018, recovering slightly in the fourth quarter, with a full-year average price of US$1.35/lb reflecting a 10.2% year on year decline for arabica. Given that the next off-season in Brazil (2019/20) is likely to hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery of prices to an average of US$1.49/lb in 2019.
Tighter supplies of robusta beans and firm Asian demand will support prices
Prices for cheaper robusta held up better during much of 2017, reflecting supply concerns in the context of disappointing weather conditions in Vietnam and Indonesia, but they dipped sharply in November-January as bean supply picked up, before stabilising at a relatively weak level. We expect prices to average 89 US cents/lb in 2018-a 12% year-on-year decline-and US$1.02/lb in 2019.

Maize
Demand
World demand for maize has increased at an astonishing pace during the past two decades, rising from a little more than 600m tonnes at the turn of the millennium to a projected 1.09bn tonnes in 2018/19, up by 2.7% compared with the previous year. Apart from 2012/13, when US crops were decimated by drought, consumption has increased each season, with growth averaging 3.3% per year over 2012/13-2016/17. While stocks mostly tightened through to 2006/07, the spike in demand has lately been more than offset by an even steeper rise in production, resulting in a build-up of supplies. Maize is primarily used as a feed ingredient, which accounts for around 55% of total usage.
Amid broad-based gains in world meat production, especially of poultry and pork, demand for high-starch, high-energy feed maize continues to trend higher almost everywhere, with growth averaging around 2% per year. Amid booming demand for biofuels, and to a lesser extent other sugars and starches, use for industrial processing has increased at an even faster rate. Led by gains in the US and China, world industrial use has surged from around 75m tonnes 20 years ago to a projected 306m tonnes in the 2018/19 marketing year. Helped by a series of large crops in Sub-Saharan Africa, food maize demand has also seen relatively firm growth in recent seasons and is forecast to reach 123m tonnes in 2018/19.
World feed demand will rise by 3% in 2018/19
Growth in global demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient in animal feed, which can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. Following an upgraded figure for the EU, we now expect 3% annual growth in the use of maize for livestock feed in 2018/19, broadly in line with the previous year, with overall demand touching a new record of 621m tonnes, up by 20m tonnes compared with 2017/18. The EU and China are likely to account for much of the increase, with notable gains also expected in Russia, Brazil, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.
The EU is a huge consumer of maize for livestock feed, with use seen averaging 57m tonnes/year (t/y) in recent seasons. Compound feed manufacturers across the bloc consume near-equal amounts of maize, barley and wheat in most years, with price and availability determining how much of each is used in a particular year. The 2018/19 season will in large part be shaped by the drought that has occurred across much of northern Europe. As a result, wheat availabilities are much tighter than normal, while pastures are bare in many countries, raising the need for additional feed grain supplies. Based on current price spreads, maize is best-placed to meet the shortfall. Feed consumption is seen climbing to a new record high of 62.5m tonnes, up by 7% from 2017/18. With question-marks too over the size of local maize crops, the additional supplies will come from a 25% rise in imports, seen climbing to 21.5m tonnes in 2017/18 (July-June). At that level, the EU would by some distance be the world's biggest importer of maize, surpassing the imports of second-placed Mexico by some 5m tonnes. The majority of this is likely to be sourced from Ukraine and Brazil, although additional purchases from Serbia and Canada are possible. Following the mid-June implementation of a 25% tariff on US maize imports by the EU, supplies from that country are not expected to be competitive.
World industrial demand set to rise again in 2018/19
Industrial processors are projected to use 306m tonnes of maize in 2018/19, up by 3% year on year to another record high. Robust global GDP growth continues to drive demand for maize-based industrial goods, including starch, while use for ethanol fuel is also increasing in the US and Brazil. There is the potential for a steep rise in maize-based biofuel production in China, where the authorities have announced plans for an ambitious nationwide ethanol blending programme, similar to the one that led to the recent boom in the US.
No big changes to US biofuels policy
The proposed Required Volume Obligations (RVOs) issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2019 were broadly in line with expectations. The blending mandate for conventional ethanol, produced mainly from maize, was unchanged from the previous year's 15bn gallons and equal to the statutory maximum. Biofuel groups and farmers were disappointed by the decision not to reallocate ethanol blending obligations waived under its small refinery exemption to larger refineries. The proposal, which could have led to additional levels of physical blending, was discussed in recent months but faced extremely stiff opposition from the oil industry. Contrary to rumours earlier this year, the authorities have also stepped back from plans to adjust current laws which prevent ethanol blended with 15% ethanol (E-15) to be sold during the summer months.

Shifting trading relationships are a worry for many US farmers
China's proposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of a large number of US agricultural products, planes and chemicals have sent shockwaves across world commodity markets. However, with China being a relatively small buyer of US maize in recent seasons, the impact of these tariffs-the first set of which were formally announced in mid-June-is likely to be fairly minor. In 2016/17 (July-June) China imported a total of 2.5m tonnes of maize, of which 437,000 tonnes originated in the US, accounting for less than 1% of total US shipments over this period. The new 25% import tariff is likely to shift demand to other origins, most likely Ukraine, already the dominant supplier to the Chinese market. US maize farmers are instead more concerned about the potential fallout from the ongoing North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations on the US's trading relationship with Mexico, the main buyer of US maize
Supply
Global maize production has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past two decades, rising from below 600m tonnes in 1999/2000 to more than 1bn tonnes since 2016/17. Production has only shown a year-on-year decline on five occasions during this period, typically owing to spells of difficult cropping weather. In general, production has been driven steadily upward by increases in both areas and yields. Amid strengthening demand for animal feed and industrial products, high market prices have encouraged additional plantings almost everywhere. New seed varieties, fertilisers and better farming practices have also been used with great effect to push up average yields, which are now approaching 6 tonnes/ha, compared with 4.4 tonnes/ha in the late 1990s.
The 2018/19 world supply outlook for maize currently appears fairly comfortable, especially when compared with wheat, production of which is expected to decline by around 6% year on year. However, much will depend on production prospects in the US, where final yields are still far from certain. An expected shift in feed demand away from wheat to maize places extra importance on the outcome of this year's US maize harvest. As long as yields are close to current expectations, the US should be able to meet any predicted uptick in demand, albeit with stocks still potentially declining to multi-year lows. Should yields fall short of expectations or demand spikes turn out to be even higher than currently predicted, there could be some further tightening of stocks and renewed upward price pressure. South America is the other major area of uncertainty, as 2018/19 crops are still not yet in the ground. Based on increases in August for the US, Argentina and Ukraine, our 2018/19 global crop estimate is raised by 2m tonnes, to 1,050m tonnes, potentially the second-largest crop on record.
US output is likely to drop in 2018/19
Helped by earlier good rains, soil moisture reserves across most parts of the US Midwest remained ahead of average but have declined compared with their late-June peak. Similarly, crop condition ratings have dipped, but at 72% good or excellent they remain slightly ahead of levels a year ago. A notable feature this season has been the crop's rapid development, which despite the delays to planting is around 7-10 days ahead of normal. Based on reports of good plant population and a potentially high number of ears, yields this year could potentially be better than the long-term trend. Although crop weather during August will be critical for yields, we are tentatively predicting a higher yield figure, which could see US production reach 366m tonnes (revised up from 361.5m tonnes previously). This would still constitute a 1.3% decline from the record high seen in 2016/17.
Smaller area and lower yields are expected in Brazil
While the global focus has already shifted to the 2018/19 crop outlook, Brazil's 2017/18 season is still far from over. Harvesting has advanced at a slower rate than last year but edged past the halfway-complete mark in early August, similar to the recent average. Our total production forecast for 2017/18 is unchanged at 82m tonnes, 16% down on the previous year. Following a spike in internal transport costs and a drop in the value of the Brazilian Real, the cost of farm inputs, including fertilisers, has risen sharply in recent months, boosting production costs in the run-up to planting of the 2018/19 maize and soybean crops. Continued disagreements about internal trucking costs have also slowed physical deliveries of fertilisers from the southern ports to the main producing areas. Very strong competition for soybeans is again expected to impact planting of the full-season (first) crop, predominantly grown in traditional producing areas in the south of the country. However, assuming producers expand soybean plantings in central and western parts, there could be large areas of farmland primed for sowing the second (safrinha) maize crop after the oilseeds are collected in the early part of 2018. Assuming an overall rise and area and normal yield levels, the 2018/19 next crop could potentially recover to around 94m tonnes, a 15% rise on 2017/18 levels.
Drought will limit production in Argentina
The second half of Argentina's 2017/18 maize-growing season was badly affected by drought, limiting output to around 32m tonnes, down by 22% year on year. Thanks to historically large stock levels, a substantial portion of which is thought to be stored on farms in temporary storage bags, such production shortfalls are unlikely to have a major impact on exportable availabilities, with shipments still projected at a larger than average 23m tonnes, down by 10% year on year.
Amid good profit margins and a favourable demand profile both at home and abroad, we have upgraded our 2018/19 plantings projection for Argentina to show a modest year-on-year increase in area. With seeding of the first crop expected to begin in September, farmers are currently optimistic about the improved soil moisture level, and a possible El Nino weather event later in the season-which normally results in higher than average levels of rainfall in parts of South America-might also be supportive for yields. The favourable price outlook is also likely to encourage farmers to maximise the use of fertilisers and high-yielding seeds. In any event, reflecting the increase in projected plantings, we have upgraded our 2018/19 crop forecast to 41.5m tonnes, potentially a new record.
A larger than average harvest is predicted in Ukraine
Farmers in Ukraine had originally been expected to favour barley in 2018/19 crop rotations. However, with the ideal barley planting window cut short by unusually cold early-spring conditions, many growers switched area into later-seeded spring crops, including maize. Official data recently confirmed a 1.3% increase in 2018/19 planted area to 4.6m ha. After dry weather at the start of the summer conditions have since become much more favourable. We have therefore reversed last month's small downward revision and now expect output to rise by 14%, to 27.5m tonnes. Given the potential for extremely strong demand from the EU and to a lesser extent China, exports are provisionally seen reaching 21.5m tonnes, a new record high.
Sowings in Russia dropped by 12% year on year
The 2018/19 production forecast for Russia, where maize has become an increasingly important export crop in recent years, has been cut by a further 1.4m tonnes to 12.6m tonnes (from 13.2m tonnes in 2017/18), with the risks skewed very much to the downside. Farmers had been expected to sow even more maize this season, but owing to difficult weather in recent months many have instead turned to oilseeds, planting additional acreage to sunflowerseed, rapeseed and soybeans. Hot weather in key growing regions could also affect yield potential.

Stocks and prices
World maize stocks reached a record 329m tonnes in 2016/17, following six consecutive years of increases. However, with the authorities in China now keen to reduce burdensome stockpiles, overall supplies have tightened fairly quickly, and global stocks are projected to decline in both 2017/18 and 2018/19. We expect global stocks to ease back to 266m tonnes by end-2018/19, below the 2016/17 peak and 3% below the previous five-year average. As China remains only a small player on the world stage, importing less than 3m tonnes in a typical year and exporting only limited amounts to North Korea, it is helpful to exclude notional estimates of Chinese inventories (no official data are published) in an analysis of world stocks. Because of some weather problems and overall strong export demand, cumulative inventories in the major suppliers (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and US) are forecast to tighten to 53.3m tonnes at end-2018/19, which would imply a decrease of 16% year on year and potentially the lowest level since 2015/16. This could help to support prices in the year ahead, but with stocks still comfortably above levels seen a decade or so ago, there is little reason to expect any sharp increase in market values, provided there is no major production shock in one of the key exporters.
Using year-end stockpiles as a gauge for measuring market supplies is the most widely used tool for evaluating the size of surpluses or deficits in a particular year. Leaving aside difficulties with definition and whether stocks can actually be accurately judged at any one particular point in the season, the differences in marketing years between the biggest producers means that any efforts to assess cumulative stocks are subject to even more uncertainties. For example, with South American stocks typically at their lowest in February and those in the US at their lowest in August, any analysis of combined stocks is inherently flawed, since inventories are never as low (or as high) as suggested by just adding together stocks in the individual countries.
China's stock estimates are highly provisional
In mid-July China's State Council announced a country-wide inspection of the quantity and quality of national and local grain reserves, to be conducted over 15 months. The checks will focus on the volume, quality and location of state stocks, and final results are due to be submitted to the State Council by the end of October 2019. According to local press reports, similar inspections were carried out in 2001 and 2009, but the results were not publicly revealed. It is therefore unlikely that the outcome of the next survey will be publicly released, although the results are likely to play a major role in determining future policy decisions. We expect stocks to be drawn down in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry. However, given that these stocks are primarily held as a domestic food security measure, this is unlikely to influence global prices.
US ending stocks are expected to drop back to 41.2m tonnes by the end of 2018/19, down by 20% from the year before and potentially a five-year low. Given reduced competition from Brazil, large supplies continue to be sent for export, with ending stocks down by around 17m tonnes from the 30-year highs seen at the end of 2017/18. While supplies are tightening, it should be stressed that the absolute level of stocks remains fairly comfortable and only marginally lower than the average.

Average prices are above year-ago levels
After declining quite sharply in May and June in response to the deepening trade dispute between the US and China, world maize export prices posted a partial recovery in July, rising by a net 6% in the weeks since our previous report. Gains were linked partly to an ongoing improvement in the US export demand profile and a spillover from a rally in wheat. Despite much smaller 2017/18 crops in Brazil and Argentina, prices in South America were only a few dollars higher than equivalent US values as new crop supplies began to replenish the exportable pipeline. Traders were also keen to maintain competitiveness with exports out of the US. In light of a tighter world supply outlook we continue to expect prices to bounce higher from first-quarter levels, especially if, as expected, the US-China trade dispute has little impact on US maize exports. However, the final size of the US crop is likely to dictate price direction in the coming months. US prices (fob Gulf) are seen as averaging US$180/tonne in 2018, compared with an average of US$195/ tonne in the five-year period ending 2017.

Palm oil
Demand
In terms of price, palm oil has become increasingly competitive relative to other vegetable and mineral oils, and as a result The Economist Intelligence Unit has increased its projections of the use of palm oil in biodiesel, most notably in Indonesia and Malaysia. Sluggish growth in Indian edible consumption will continue to act as a constraint, but we have revised up our forecast for global consumption in 2017/18 to 67.4m tonnes, up 4.4% up on 2016/17 levels. Further growth in biodiesel use is expected in 2018/19, and this underpins our projection of a 3.9% increase in overall consumption in 2018/19.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
In India, palm oil demand has been below expectations during 2017/18. Although this is in part accounted for by the imposition of higher import duties, there is concern that it represents a more fundamental shift in demand away from palm oil to other vegetable oils. We have again revised down our forecast of consumption in 2017/18, to below 9.7m tonnes. Further downward revisions are possible, although there are indications that consumption during the final quarter of 2017/18 may at least be maintained, partly as a result of a steadying of the rupee against the US dollar and partly as a result of low stocks of vanaspati (a type of thick vegetable oil used in India) at retail level. Indian import levies on palm oil are now on a par with soft seed oils. This, coupled with increasing price competitiveness at international level, should mean that Indian palm oil consumption will grow strongly in 2018/19, registering an above-average growth rate of 5.4%.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post solid growth in 2018-19
Indonesian biodiesel production is running ahead of expectations, reflecting the increased competiveness of palm oil as a feedstock following a build-up of local stocks. Improving biodiesel exports and greater offtake in the domestic market have both contributed to this recent growth. Our estimate of 2017/18 palm oil consumption in Indonesia is raised to 10.2m tonnes, representing annual growth of more than 11%. There is scope for further gains in 2018/19, provided palm oil retains its competitiveness. There is plenty of spare production capacity in Indonesia, and the authorities plan to increase the domestic incorporation mandate further. As a result, we expect consumption to rise by a further 3% in 2018/19.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by soybean competition
In China, palm oil continues to face strong competition from soybean oil, but falling palm oil prices and a modest recovery in the instant noodles sector have improved the outlook. We continue to expect consumption to rise by 7.4% year on year in 2017/18, ending four consecutive years of decline. The bilateral trade war between the US and China presents an upside risk to palm oil demand; China introduced a 25% tariff on imports of US soybeans in June as part of the bilateral trade dispute. If China has difficulty sourcing sufficient quantities of soybeans from other exporters such as Brazil, for example, this would raise domestic soybean prices and therefore make palm oil more competitive. We will await further details on changes to China's trade flows before revising our forecast. At the time of writing there were few signs of any increase in Chinese imports of palm oil over previously expected levels.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
Palm oil prices in the EU are becoming more competitive with mineral oil prices. This, along with higher admixture rates, is encouraging growth in palm oil imports and consumption, despite increased competition from biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina. EU legislators moved closer to discouraging the use of palm oil in the biofuels sector when negotiators from the Commission and the European Parliament agreed to freeze the use of high-risk indirect land use change for the production of biofuels (ie, palm-oil based biofuels) at 2019 levels and to phase them out completely by 2030. While the immediate impact of this agreement will be negligible, it clearly has significant long-term impacts. In the food sector, palm oil demand is expected to remain stable. As a result, we expect EU palm oil consumption growth to moderate from 1.2% in 2017/18 to just 0.8% in 2018/19. The rate of growth will be heavily influenced by the use in the biofuels sectors, especially in Spain and Germany.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia is set to rise
Malaysian palm oil demand growth has been limited by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. The implementation of the B10 mandate has been persistently delayed-the most recent government announcements indicate implementation in the second half of 2019. Malaysian exports of biodiesel have been higher than previously expected, and domestic demand for B7 biodiesel is also reported to be improving. We now expect consumption in 2017/18 to be 13.4% above 2016/17 levels. We have also raised our forecast for palm oil consumption in 2018/19 to reflect higher biodiesel exports and, to a lesser extent, the planned implementation of the B10 incorporation mandate.
Consumption prospects in other countries are broadly positive
The geographical markets for palm oil are diverse, with the top five consumers accounting for less than 55% of global consumption. There have been sharp increases in exports to a number of these destinations, including Pakistan, Iran, the Philippines and various other Asian and African destinations. The largest of these "other" consumers, Pakistan, is likely to show sustained growth, given that attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been mostly unsuccessful. With palm oil prices continuing to fall, there is sustained interest in palm oil from these other consumers. We expect consumption growth in this group of countries to be higher than previously forecast.

Supply
Output trends in the two major producers continue to diverge: while output is growing steadily in Indonesia, production in Malaysia has been disappointing Overall, our forecast of palm oil output in 2017/18 has been reduced to 70.4m tonnes, although this still represents an above-average growth rate of 6.4%. By contrast, we have increased our projections of output in 2018/19, largely reflecting a higher forecast for Indonesia, although we still expect overall global growth to be very modest at 2.3%. In 2018/19 the mature area will expand, albeit slowly, but yield outcomes will be negatively affected by tree stress and potentially lower input use.
Yield cycle may offset favourable growing conditions
Indonesian production of palm oil is now rising seasonally, but our forecast of 2017/18 season output remains unchanged at 38.3m tonnes. While the 2017/18 growth rate is below recent levels, it is building on particularly rapid growth of 16.4% in 2016/17. Rainfall has been favourable and should encourage good yields over the next 6-9 months. Despite the slowdown in plantings, the mature area for next season will be higher, albeit by a modest 3.4%. However, the overall impact of favourable growing conditions may be constrained by the yield cycle. A modest yield increase would result in Indonesia's palm oil production expanding by a below-average 3.8%. Our revised forecast of output of 39.8m tonnes remains below some local estimates, which put the total above 40m tonnes.
Malaysian output continues to disappoint
Malaysia's palm oil production remains below expectations. Normally, output would be increasing at this stage of the season, but official measures of June output show a 13% fall from May levels. This would appear to be the result of some workers taking extended leave and a higher than expected replanting rate, as well as a downturn in the biological yield cycle. We have again revised down our forecast for 2017/18 production growth, although we are still expecting output to be almost 8% above 2016/17 levels. Production is unlikely to grow further in 2018/19; current tree stress will inhibit yields into the 2018/19 season, and an ageing tree population will also contribute to a disappointing outturn. On the positive side, however, recent weather conditions have largely been favourable, which will help to avoid a sharper downturn in 2018/19. We therefore expect production levels in 2018/19 to be broadly similar to those recorded in 2017/18.

Thailand output exceeds expectations
The increase in yields in Thailand during 2017/18 has been especially strong, reflecting good weather and favourable oil extraction rates. In 2018/19 we expect production to be only slightly below the 2017/18 level as tree stress and the probable use of lower inputs reduce yields. In Colombia, output is likely to grow steadily over the forecast period as its mature area expands. There remains potential for further land for palm oil cultivation without any deforestation issues. Recent yields have largely been above year-earlier levels and should show sustained growth, reflecting the changing age distribution of the trees. Some other smaller palm oil-producing countries, such as Honduras, will also see solid output growth in 2017/18.
Stocks and prices
Palm oil stocks in Malaysia, which have been on a downward trend, are now rising despite the smaller than expected local production. Indonesian stocks have been rising consistently despite increases in local consumption. The reduction in expected palm oil output in 2017/18 has lowered the end-season stocks to the equivalent of 67 days of consumption (from 68 days previously). Although stocks are below the peak of 71 days recorded at the end of 2014/15, they remain above the previous five-year average. However, we expect global stocks to climb to 74 days of cosumption by the end of 2018/19, a level last seen in the mid-1990s.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further in 2018-19
Physical palm oil prices continued their downward trajectory in July, in line with our expectations. Futures prices have also tended to be weak, although they stabilised in the second half of the month. We continue to expect global palm oil prices to decline in the second half of 2018, albeit at a slightly slower rate. Overall, we expect average palm oil prices to fall by 9.7% in 2018 and a further 8.5% in 2019. We expect prices to drop below US$600/tonne from the second quarter of 2019, which would be their lowest level since late 2015. However, further downgrades to Malaysian production forecasts could lead to a more moderate price decline. Given the scale of the 2018/19 surplus, risks to the 2019/20 price forecasts are on the downside.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global rapeseed oil consumption to fall in 2017/18 for the third consecutive season, to its lowest level since 2012/13. Rapeseed oil is suffering from increasing price competition from sunflowerseed oil, which has not been offset by higher mineral oil prices. We currently expect consumption to decline by 5.8% in 2017/18, and recent increases in rapeseed oil prices, following downgrades to future production prospects, are likely to constrain consumption growth in 2018/19 as well. We have reduced our projections of 2018/19 consumption in almost all of the major consumers and are forecasting an overall total of 25.5m tonnes, just 2.6% above 2017/18 levels. Further downward revisions may be necessary.
EU consumption is threatened by biodiesel imports
Rapeseed oil use in the biodiesel sector in the EU has faced strong competition from recycled cooking oil and from imported biodiesel. In the food sector, cheaper sunflowerseed and soybean oils have provided stiff competition. Thus rapeseed oil consumption in the EU is expected to fall for the third consecutive year in 2017/18, to just over 9.9m tonnes, and to decline again in 2018/19, given continued competitive pressures and downgrades to local production forecasts.
Chinese consumption is limited by supply constraints
In China, local rapeseed availability is limited, despite recent improvements in local crushing of imported rapeseed, and this is acting as a constraint on consumption. Rapeseed oil imports into China have risen in recent months, but from a low base. We have made a small upward adjustment to our forecast of China's rapeseed oil consumption, but even so consumption is expected to contract by 17.3% in 2017/18. Higher local estimates of rapeseed production in 2018/19 should help to boost consumption, following three consecutive years of decline. Crush rates should increase, helping to bridge the gap created by lower soybean imports (as China's 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US pushes up local prices). We therefore expect China's rapeseed oil consumption to rebound by 12.6% in 2018/19.
India's consumption will rebound in 2017/18
In India, we expect rapeseed oil consumption to show robust growth of 14.2% in 2017/18, encouraged by improved local availability and strong GDP growth. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil in north and central India, which typically absorbs local production along with a small, but increasing, volume of imports. However, import volumes may be negatively affected by the recent increase in import duties. We expect that 2018/19 consumption will rise by only a small amount-less than 0.5%-reflecting the marginal rise in local production.
Only modest demand growth is likely in the US market
Biodiesel production in the US contracted sharply in June, with a consequent negative impact on imports of rapeseed oil. We have reduced our forecast of 2017/18 US rapeseed oil consumption accordingly, to 2.7m tonnes, slightly below 2016/17 levels.
Several smaller consumers which switched away from rapeseed oil in 2016/17 have recently returned to the market. However, growth in rapeseed oil consumption among this "other" consumers category during 2017/18 is likely to be constrained by more competitive sunflowerseed oil.

Supply
World production of rapeseed oil has plateaued at just above 25m tonnes. Our forecast of 2017/18 output now stands at 25.3m tonnes, very similar to output in each of the preceding two seasons. Prospects for global rapeseed production in 2018/19 are threatened by dry conditions in the EU, Canada and Australia, with a negative impact particularly likely in the EU, where harvesting has already started. Even allowing for a reduction in rapeseed stocks, rapeseed oil output is unlikely to rise much above 25m tonnes in 2018/19.
Weaker demand is weighing on EU rapeseed oil production
Crush margins for EU rapeseed in 2017/18 are poor because of weak demand for rapeseed oil from the biodiesel sector, reflecting increased competition from imported biodiesel. We now expect 2017/18 EU rapeseed oil production to total just 10m tonnes, the lowest level of output since 2012/13. For 2018/19 exceptionally hot and dry weather in recent weeks has taken a toll on the crop outlook. Estimates of the likely size of the crop are falling, with the most recent projections putting the crop less than 20m tonnes, a level not seen since the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. Harvesting started in early July, with early yield reports disappointing. Even allowing for high carry-in stocks, 2018/19 rapeseed oil production will be affected by the low seed production level. We are now expecting EU rapeseed oil production to fall further in 2018/19, by some 5% from 2017/18 levels.
China will rely on imports for oil production
Chinese rapeseed oil production is becoming increasingly dependent on imported seed supplies. So far in the 2017/18 season rapeseed imports are running well above year-ago levels. While recent import levels have been insufficient to maintain the earlier crush pace, we maintain our view that rapeseed oil production will expand by 1.7% in 2017/18. The uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on imports of US soybeans has so far not impacted rapeseed import levels. Dry conditions have been experienced over much of the Chinese oilseed areas, with downgrades to production prospects for most oilseed crops. Rapeseed appears to have largely avoided the dry conditions, and prospects for the Chinese 2018/19 rapeseed crop remain favourable, with a likely 6% growth in output. We expect rapeseed oil production to expand by 2.6% in 2018/19, the second consecutive year of growth. Risks to the forecast are to the upside, for example if rapeseed meal is used as a substitute to make up for any shortfall in soybean crushing as a result of the escalating US-China trade dispute.
Canada's 2017/18 harvest will rise
We continue to expect 2017/18 Canadian canola oil production to reach 4.1m tonnes, aided by strong exports of canola oil to the US, Chile and South Korea. For 2018/19, official data point to a reduction in the area planted to canola in 2018/19 as farmers return to grain crops, although some industry observers suggest that official data are overstating the level of reduction. While earlier rainfall improved soil moisture conditions, a recent dry spell means that there is again growing concern over dry conditions in Canada. Nonetheless, recent local estimates still suggest a crop approaching 22m tonnes, which would be a new record and would mean that Canada overtakes the EU as the largest rapeseed producer. Canadian canola oil production is more dependent on market develop-ments than on the availability of seed for crushing. As a result, we main-tain our forecast of 4.3m tonnes for canola oil production in 2018/19, although increased competition for available canola seed, as well as a potential slow-down in demand for canola oil for local biodiesel production, could act as constraints.
India's production is set to grow owing to higher rapeseed imports
In India, 2017/18 rapeseed oil production is still expected to jump by 14.2% year on year, helped by a relatively large local rapeseed crop. However, successful rapeseed growing requires good soil moisture levels, and while the 2018/19 monsoon season started with higher than normal rainfalls, recent rainfall totals have been disappointing. Overall, rainfall is 5% below normal levels and may discourage rapeseed plantings. The Indian government has raised vegetable oil import tariffs and increased minimum support prices in an attempt to encourage local production. However, low domestic prices for rapeseed have affected crop profitability for farmers. Despite this, it appears that the rapeseed area and production levels are likely to remain steady year on year in 2018/19. For the moment, we have retained our forecast of modest 0.8% growth in rapeseed oil production in 2018/19.
Australian production could be constrained by dry conditions
There remain doubts over the likely 2018/19 Australian canola crop, with rainfall needed to allow normal crop development. With a lower planted area, good yields will be required to maintain output. At the moment, we are expecting production to fall by more than 10% from 2017/18 levels. Despite dry conditions in Belarus and Russia, the area planted to rapeseed has increased in both countries, which should support larger than average crops. The harvesting of winter rapeseed in Ukraine is virtually complete and consistent with an overall harvest of 2.5m tonnes. Rapeseed is reportedly the most profitable of the oilseed crops in Ukraine, and further expansion of the area planted to rapeseed is expected.

Stocks and prices
We expect global rapeseed oil stocks to rise in 2017/18 on the back of a market surplus. However, when measured as share of consumption, oil stocks will remain well below the average in recent years. By contrast, rapeseed stocks will be around average levels at end-2017/18. The production downgrade for 2018/19 means that the season will now see a market deficit, with rapeseed oil stocks ending the season at very low levels. Rapeseed stocks are also expected to be below normal at the end of 2018/19, although projections suggest that there will be sufficient stocks to allow marginally higher rapeseed oil production.

Concern over production leads to firmer prices
The impending tightness of the rapeseed oil market is being reflected in increasing prices. Physical prices of rapeseed oil were especially strong in July, recording the largest increase of any of the major vegetable oils. Futures prices for rapeseed have also been firmer, especially on the European market. The substantial downgrading of the EU crop and fears over output elsewhere have changed market sentiment. The increase in prices that we expected has thus set in earlier than previously forecast, and we now expect prices to rise steadily for the foreseeable future. They are expected to exceed US$900/tonne by the second quarter of 2019.

Rice
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global rice consumption to grow by 1.6% in 2017/18 to a record 492m tonnes. Asian markets, which account for an estimated 90% of world use, will drive this expansion, notably via increased demand in India. Smaller increases are likely elsewhere in East and South Asia, as well as in Latin America and Africa. Global demand is expected to continue on an upward trajectory in 2018/19 to reach almost 500m tonnes. However, the pace of growth will moderate, albeit slightly, as higher incomes and changing dietary preferences prompt a shift to greater protein consumption at the expense of traditional staples.
Food demand will remain the main driver of total use
Accordingly, rice consumption per head is anticipated to fall in 2018/19. In terms of non-food usage, the use of rice for animal feed is expected to decline, largely reflecting a reduced uptake in China, the dominant consumer. Japan has also utilised stocks of imported rice in feed mixes, but data suggest that demand for domestic rice feed may have peaked. Overall, the non-food usage of rice (including by the industrial sector) will continue to account for only a small proportion of overall demand and will fall as a share of overall consumption.
Trade in rice will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2017
Africa and Asia account for more than two-thirds of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met through imports. Following record global rice purchases in 2017, of 45.4m tonnes, many Asian buyers are likely to be well stocked. Furthermore, strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. In light of strong demand from Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines in the first half of the year, we expected global trade to increase by more than 2.5% to almost 47m tonnes between 2016/17 and 2017/18, with similar volumes likely the following year.
China remains the world's leading consumer
China is by far the world's largest consumer of rice, representing almost 30% of global demand. Although locally produced rice accounts for the bulk of national consumption, China is also the world's largest importer.
The potential impact of lower farmer support prices is unclear
Domestic early-season long-grain milled rice still commands hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China. We expect China's purchases to peak at 5m tonnes in 2017/18 before declining slightly in 2018/19. Although it remains unclear how lower state support will impact rice imports, for now we think that imports are likely to fall in 2018/19 as the government seeks to reduce inventories. Nonetheless, import volumes are likely to remain substantial, given that local prices remain above international values. In 2018/19 as a whole shipments are projected at 4.5m tonnes.
Bangladesh is expected to buy significantly more rice in 2018
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. The three domestic crops cut each year are the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July) and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs is met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market, especially in times of shortages. Purchases in 2018 are expected to reach 2m tonnes-more than three times the 2017 level-before falling again in 2019 as domestic supply improves.
The Philippines is expected to remain a key buyer
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in about a decade. By contrast, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports progressed strongly in 2017 to reach 1.4m tonnes, and import levels are expected to increase again in 2018 as the Philippines aims to ensure domestic supply.
Solid growth in Saudi consumption of cereals
In Saudi Arabia, consumption of cereals, including rice, has posted strong growth over the past two decades. As the preferred ingredient for inclusion in feed rations, barley accounts for more than half of aggregate domestic demand, while growth in the use of other commodities, including wheat and maize in the food and feed sector, respectively, has been particularly notable.
Rice is a staple food, with kabsah, a traditional dish, being consumed widely. In addition, significant volumes are eaten by foreign workers, chiefly from South Asia. However, demand for white rice among middle- and high-income families has fallen, reflecting a shift towards an increased uptake of protein as well as fruits and vegetables. Overall, therefore, growth in rice consumption has been relatively modest. Consumption is forecast at around 1.3m tonnes in 2018/19, little changed on the previous year, and only marginally higher than the 1.1m tonnes seen a decade ago.
Saudi Arabia's local market is one of the largest in the Middle East
Nevertheless, the domestic rice market in Saudi Arabia remains one the largest in the Middle East-comparable in size to Iraq and second only to Iran. As climate conditions do not allow for domestic rice cultivation, local market needs are met entirely through imports, which are typically of a very high quality and consist mainly of fragrant-especially basmati-varieties. The origins of the nation's international rice purchases have changed little over the years, with South Asian exporters the most important suppliers. Purchases from India and Pakistan are predominantly of basmati varieties, with relatively smaller quantities of high-quality white and parboiled types secured from a range of origins, including Thailand, Vietnam, the US, China and Australia.

Supply
With larger crops in a number of leading Asian producers, including India, more than compensating for disappointing harvests in other regions, world rice output in 2017/18 is forecast to expand by just under 1% year on year, to 492m tonnes. The outlook for 2018/19 remains tentative but, as in most years, it will depend on crops in Asia's main producers-primarily India, where the monsoon season began on June 1st. Given that only a small expansion of planted area is likely, an increase in global output will depend on yields. We expect world output to edge higher in 2018/19, by 0.5%, to reach a record 495m tonnes. All of our scenarios assume continued state support to farmers in Asia, as recently announced in India, although seeding in China is likely to fall as the authorities seek to reduce production to draw down excess inventories.
Global production prospects are to a large degree shaped by the outlook for India's main summer-sown (kharif) crop, which is crucial both in terms of domestic supply and the surplus available for export. According to government data, rice plantings were complete on 19.8m ha by the end of July, broadly equivalent to around half of intended acreage during the season but representing a contraction of 12% on the preceding season.
To some extent, this is linked to weaker than anticipated rains during stages of the monsoon season, with cumulative rains 8% below the long-term average as at August 3rd (more or less half-way through the season). Private forecaster Skymet has suggested that precipitation could be below average in the final two months of the season, although the India Meteorological Department, a state body, is predicting average levels, corresponding to 95% of the long-run average. Nevertheless, the outlook carries a model error ranging from -8% to +8%.
The government has raised kharif support prices
In early July the government announced that it will lift minimum support prices for all 2018/19 kharif crops, including a 13% rise for common-grade paddy (rice) to Rs1,750 (US$255) a tonne. Assuming that rains are in line with normal levels in the main rice-growing areas, all rice production in 2018/19, which also includes the relatively tiny winter-seeded (rabi) crop, is forecast at a record of 113m tonnes, up from 111m tonnes in the preceding season.
Trade with Asian buyers remains robust
Trade flows during the first five months of 2018 were marginally ahead of the previous year, with shipments totalling 5.2m tonnes. After the previous season's heavy purchases, including of old crop state reserves from Thailand, demand from African importers has been somewhat slower during the course of this year. Data show that shipments to the region fell by more than 20% year on year, with reductions for exports to Ghana, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire and Egypt. Sales to Europe and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) also contracted, but demand from Asian buyers has increased, chiefly reflecting Bangladesh's need to secure bigger volumes owing to local shortages. Deliveries to the Bangladeshi market averaged close to 150,000 tonnes per month during January-May, compared with less than 18,000 tonnes per month in the year-earlier period.
We expect India's full-year exports to rise to 12.2m tonnes, from 11.7m tonnes in the previous season. Exports are currently running below the levels necessary for such a rise, but we expect the pace to accelerate later in the season, given that prices have fallen at most major origins, including India, during the course of this year, and that African buyers are likely to return to the world market to boost domestic stocks. Shipments could be marginally higher in 2018/19 based on the assumption that demand from buyers in Africa and Asia is robust, but the outlook is much more tentative.
Drought conditions in Pakistan harm rice production prospects
The rice production outlook for Pakistan is uncertain owing to water shortages in the main producing areas. In early June the Pakistan Meteorological Department released a drought warning, indicating that parts of the country were experiencing severe soil moisture deficits owing to persistent below-average rainfall since the tail end of 2017. Water availability in the main reservoirs was estimated to be more than 50% below average, constraining planting operations.
A smaller crop could be problematic for exporters
Rice sowings usually commence in the later stages of May and early June in southern areas of the country, while cultivation in northern areas usually takes place in late July. However, in the current season fieldwork has been running as much as 45 days behind schedule. Some growers will therefore seed much less than anticipated, and yield potential could be significantly down. While the situation may improve if monsoon rains intensify, we now expect output to fall by 2.8% year on year, to 7m tonnes (from 7.4m tonnes previously). This will have a knock-on impact on export volumes, given that around half of the crop is typically exported. We project that a crop of 7m tonnes would support exports of 3.9m tonnes, down from 4.1m tonnes in the preceding season.
The Chinese government is keen to reduce inventory levels
The Chinese government aims to reduce rice acreage by around 2% by scaling back low-quality rice production. Ultimately, this is meant to address the significant structural imbalance between domestic supply and demand. In late April the Communist Party leadership of Hunan Province stated that it aimed to reduce plantings by 200,000 ha in the province during the current year, shifting land to high-value specialty crops. This development is significant, since state policy had previously been geared towards stabilising or increasing paddy (rice) output. Acreage has changed little over the years, so a fall of 2% would represent the first significant decline since 2003/04. Furthermore, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) outlined lower minimum purchasing prices in early 2018 across all types of rice, with falls of between 8% and 11% noted. This is important, because it represents the second consecutive annual cut in farmer support, and suggests that the government is aware that supply and demand must be rebalanced owing to burdensome inventories.
The government has also announced a reform of its minimum price support scheme for rice. This year's programme sets stricter conditions for activating minimum price procurement-which can only take place when the market price has remained below the minimum set price for three consecutive days. The scheme must be suspended once the market price exceeds the minimum support price for another three days. This latest policy shift illustrates further the administration's eagerness to reshape the rice sector by introducing market-based conditions under which rice will be procured from farmers. As with efforts to reduce the production of low-quality indica rice, this underlines the government's awareness that domestic stock levels are unsustainably high.
Procurement of early indica rice runs from August 1st-September 30th, while middle and late indica rice procurement runs from October 10th until January 31st. Japonica rice procurement commences on November 1st and must close by the end of February.
Exports offer a convenient way for China to reduce stocks
China's exports of rice have traditionally been nominal and shaped by sales of japonica varieties, including to Japan and South Korea, for example. However, there was a big shift in 2017, with shipments rising sharply, largely owing to sales of indica rice to African nations. These included particularly heavy deliveries to Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal and Sierra Leone. In 2017 as a whole China's total rice exports reached 1.2m tonnes, up from less than 400,000 tonnes in 2016 and the highest annual total in a decade. Prospects for exports in 2018-19 are somewhat uncertain at this stage. Nevertheless, with the government seeking to reduce reserves, exports are likely to be significantly above-average in the next two years.
Prospects for rice production in Thailand in 2017/18 were boosted by above-average precipitation. Based on an expansion of planted area across both seasons, total production is projected to grow by 5%, to 20.5m tonnes. On the basis of another year of high global trade, combined with current prices for white rice, farmers are expected to expand the area sown to rice in 2018/19. Assuming beneficial conditions, rice output could rise by a further 5%, to close to 22m tonnes.
Thai exports are likely to slip owing to competition from India
Thailand's exports of all varieties of rice totalled 11.5m tonnes in 2017-easily its highest total and up from 9.9m tonnes the year before. The strong increase was mainly attributable to a large expansion of shipments to markets in Africa, with a portion almost certainly consisting of older intervention reserves from the government's long-held stockpile. Since the government is reported to have sold off food-quality stocks from past harvests last year, exporters will have no access to attractively priced inventories that can be sold to buyers in Africa and other regions. Consequently, total exports in 2018 could decline by 1m tonnes, to 10.5m tonnes, and remain fairly flat in 2019.
Conditions for the next US crop appear positive, with recent weekly Crop Progress Reports issued by the US Department of Agriculture estimating that 69% of paddy fields were in good or excellent condition at the end of July, matching the average for this time of the season. With nearly two-thirds of crop headed, harvesting is expected to commence during August. Based on long-grain area gains, total acreage in the US is expected to expand by one-fifth year on year, and with trend-based yields anticipated, production should rebound to reach 6.8m tonnes (up from 5.7m tonnes in the previous year). Given that a larger crop should ensure that availabilities are much improved, exports in 2019 are likely to expand to 3.6m tonnes, up from 3.2m tonnes in the previous season.
Rice production puts pressure on Egyptian water supplies
Egypt has traditionally been a relatively small but important rice-producing country. While the bulk of its crop is channelled to the local market, it is also a modest exporter of medium-grain varieties to global markets, competing with nations such as the US and Australia. The government has for a number of years been using restrictions on exports to ensure availabilities for local consumption. The government is now seeking to reduce the cultivation of water-intensive crops, including rice. According to reports, 1,400 litres of water are used in the production of 1 kg of rice, with agriculture accounting for an estimated 80% of Egypt's total water resources. In January the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation announced a reduction of more than 30% year on year in the approved rice area in 2018/19, to 304,080 ha. According to local reports, the heavy drop in area is linked to local farmers having grown more rice than the government's allotment during the previous year. In addition, farmers were subjected to financial penalties for exceeding the official area target.
Large-scale imports could feature in the longer term
Given that rice cultivation in Egypt is attractive for farmers, it seems possible that growers could again boost plantings above the allotted target. Nevertheless, we still anticipate a fall in output in 2018/19 of about 1m tonnes, to 3.3m tonnes, the lowest in eight seasons. Although local demand has been falling in recent years as the population increasingly turns to alternative, cheaper forms of carbohydrates, such as pasta, imports of rice are likely to rise to 300,000 tonnes, but this is still small in terms of the overall supply-and-demand balance sheet. However, on June 5th the prime minister, Sherif Ismail, announced that the country would import rice so as to increase stocks and control the market. While no timeframe was provided, the statement could be significant, potentially signalling a switch to large-scale imports as production continues to fall. Some traders and analysts have suggested that purchases from the world market could end up totalling as much as 1m tonnes per year. Exports are expected to remain officially banned in 2018-19. However, some modest amounts-in the order of 50,000 tonnes per year-are expected to find their way on to international market, as has been the case in recent years during times of restrictions.

Stocks and prices
We still expect global stocks to fall by around 5% year on year 105m tonnes by the end of the 2018/19 season. After the significant tightening of recent years, mostly on account of a drawdown of government reserves in Thailand, stocks held by the five major exporters are expected to show little change year on year. At 20m tonnes, aggregate stocks are seen down by just 1m tonnes from the season before. In China, the government is encouraging farmers to scale back production of low-quality rice and diversify into high-value varieties as a means of preventing further excessive growth of inventories. Accordingly, we anticipate some modest tightening of inventories in 2018/19 after years of accumulation.
Caution is generally advised when analysing stocks data, since the bulk of year-end figures provided are arrived at via residual calculation, as most countries do not collect or provide meaningful figures. Furthermore, inventories in China on a milled weight tonnage-equivalent could total as much as 70m-80m tonnes, but no official data are published. The exclusion of Chinese stocks, therefore, produces a more realistic figure for what is available on the world market, mostly located in the five major exporters, and specifically in India.

Asian markets for white and parboiled grades of rice generally eased in July and early August as continued arrivals of new crop supplies and slower demand from leading buyers weighed on sentiment. After the previous month's steep falls, quotations in Thailand for key white grades were only slightly weaker and in line with those from a year earlier. By contrast, export quotations for broken rice in Vietnam fell heavily during July and into early August, with 5% broken falling by US$39/tonne (some 9%) to US$386/tonne fob Ho Chi Minh. In addition to weak export interest, much of the fall reflected efforts by exporters to bring prices closer to parity with Thailand, stimulating demand from importers.
In India, meanwhile, export values were only a touch below month-ago levels. Although sluggish buying interest was a source of bearish pressure, reports suggested that exporters were holding on to stocks, given the slow pace of planting during the 2018/19 kharif season. Elsewhere in South Asia there were heightened worries about drought conditions in Pakistan, with planting of the monsoon crop as much as two months behind schedule in some parts of Sindh province, raising worries that production could be much smaller than in the previous season. While this provided a degree of support to the market, a depreciating local currency pressured US dollar-denominated values, with the 5% broken grade having falling by about 10% since early July.
Recent price declines have depressed the 2018-19 outlook
Based on recent developments in pricing-notably the continued steep falls in prices amid prospects for ample global supplies-we have revised down our forecasts for 2018. The average price of Thailand's 100% B grade for the third quarter has been cut by a further US$15/tonne, to US$395/tonne. With an adjustment for the final quarter, the full year average value is lowered to US$406/tonne fob Bangkok ports. However, this would still equate to a year-on-year increase of more than 4% and a four-year high, largely owing to demand-led gains in international prices in early 2018. Over the remainder of the forecast period through to the third quarter of 2020 export quotations are likely to range between US$400/tonne and US$410/tonne fob, with some support from a modest tightening of supplies.

Soybeans
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global soybean consumption to increase for a ninth consecutive year in 2017/18, to a record 337m tonnes, with growth of 4% broadly matching the average of recent years. In addition to the captive use of supplies in feed and other sectors in the biggest producers, the US and Brazil, growth also reflects expanding demand for soybean meal and soybean oil in global markets, with trade in both soybean products expected to be close to record highs this year. In 2018/19, further growth in consumption is anticpated, of around 4.5%, to 352m tonnes.
The principal driver of the near-uninteruped expansion of demand over the past decade has been rising use in Asia, mostly China, underpinned by the increasing uptake in that country's vast feed sector. While the poultry, livestock and dairy sectors have made the greatest contribution, the aquaculture sector has become an increasingly important source of growth, with soybean meal the feed ingredient of choice owing to its abundance and high protein content. Soybean consumption in other regions is relatively small but has also risen steadily in recent years, with notable increases in the Middle East and Africa.
However, overall consumption growth in China is likely to moderate in 2018-19 compared with recent years, assuming that rising trade barriers cause China to reduce its purchases from the world market slightly. Nevertheless, consistent with our expectations of larger shipments by the US to other markets, growth in demand in other regions, including the EU, will compensate. Furthermore, a recovery in Argentina's production would boost supplies for local processing as consumption there rebounds.
We forecast that global trade in soybeans in 2017/18 (September/October basis) will reach 151m tonnes. Although this would be a record volume, it represents a significantly slower year-on-year expansion compared with past years owing to only a marginal increase in the volume of shipments headed to China. In 2018/19, while China's purchases may actually fall, bigger imports by other buyers should more than compensate as trade rises to 154m tonnes.
Chinese purchases of US soybeans have floundered since April as bilateral trade tensions have escalated. The impact on Chinese processors has been limited, since this period coincided with the southern hemisphere export programme. Nevertheless, even before April China's imports of US supplies were much smaller than in the previous season owing to big purchases from Brazil between October and January. More recently, Chinese demand has reportedly slowed owing to heavy stocks and an erosion of processing margins. As a result, and based on known or expected shipments through to the end of the year, deliveries to China in 2017/18 are forecast at 97m tonnes, a small year-on-year increase.
The 2018/19 trade year is characterised by a great deal of uncertainty regarding China's needs owing to the implementation of a 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US, which came into effect on July 6th. Nonetheless, the US-China trade war is unlikely to dent soybean demand significantly as China will probably source more from other origins, primarily Brazil. Additionally, industry and trade sources suggest that purchases of other feed ingredients, such as rapeseed/canola, sunflowerseed and possibly even soybean meal, could compensate for any shortfall. Nevertheless, supplies at South American origins are likely to be tighter than normal from October 2018 onwards until new crops are threshed in early 2019. As a result, it is possible that, even with the import tariffs in place, Chinese buyers will be required to source as much as 15m tonnes from the US in 2018/19-although this is well below its purchases of around 30m tonnes per year in recent years. China's total imports are forecast to fall to 95.5m tonnes in 2018/19, the first fall in eight years.
We expect China's total soybean consumption in 2017/18 to expand by a robust 8% to a record 107m tonnes, with imports accounting for around 90% of consumption. The government is working to boost local production, which is typically channelled to food sectors. Despite lower imports in 2018/19 we expect higher domestic output and some destocking to support overall consumption growth of 5% year on year to 112m tonnes.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
US soybean consumption in 2017/18 is forecast to reach an all-time high of nearly 59m tonnes, after a large crop boosted supplies for processing. In addition to local feed sector needs, strong international demand for soymeal-owing to reduced supplies from drought-hit Argentina-has boosted local crushing. We expect another large crop in 2018/19 to support further consumption growth, of 1% year on year.
In South America the outlook for consumption is weak, largely reflecting trends in Argentina, where we forecast consumption to dip by 5.4% in 2017/18-the first contraction in five seasons-after a heavily reduced crop tightened availabilities for processing. While ample domestic stocks and a reduction in export volumes have helped to ease the impact on domestic availability, some growers may hold on to inventories as export taxes are gradually reduced. In 2018/19, assuming a recovery in soybean production and with firm demand for soybean product exports, domestic processing and total consumption should rebound.

Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successive record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes, domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall consumption. The remainder is typically met by imports of soybeans and soybean meal, typically accounting for up to 35m tonnes. In 2017/18 soybean imports are likely to rise after the previous season's fall. In recent months EU import demand has strengthened as buyers have taken advantage of the heavy fall in US market prices. With a poor rapeseed/canola crop on the horizon, another season of increased imports is expected in 2018/19, with consumption reaching 17m tonnes, up from 16m tonnes in the previous year.
Supply
Boosted by larger plantings in the US and Brazil as well as increases in relatively smaller players such as Canada, eastern Europe, China and the EU, global sowings are estimated to have risen by 4% year on year in 2017/18 to their highest ever level. However, with yields being compromised by adverse weather in some countries-most notably Argentina, where crops were first ravaged by drought and then impacted by heavy rains and flooding during harvesting-global production is estimated to have contracted by 3.8% year on year, to 335m tonnes. Nonetheless, this is still about 30m tonnes higher than the average of the previous five seasons. The outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, but with a further expansion of seeded area likely-led by growth in South America-output could recover to 359m tonnes, a year-on-year increase of 6.9%.
US exports are lagging behind, unrelated to trade tensions
With the 2017/18 export campaign in its final stages, cumulative shipments in the US marketing year (which began on September 1st) stood at 52.4m tonnes by July 26th, around 4.4m tonnes short of the full-year forecast, with five weeks of the season remaining. The overall tally is just 4% lower year on year and appears quite respectable, considering that exports to China have dipped significantly. Weaker Chinese demand for US supplies in recent months is partially attributable to the escalating bilateral trade war; however, it is also due to the fact that China made large purchases from Brazil in the September-January period-corresponding to the bulk of the northern hemisphere's export programme-as larger than aveage supplies in Brazil helped to suppress prices. In May-July 2018, however, US exports to markets other than China (including Argentina and markets in Asia, Africa and the EU) hit a record level, helping to avoid a greater drop in total export volumes.
The June Acreage Report of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was broadly in line with expectations. Based on farmer surveys in the first two weeks of June, the USDA predicted that soybean plantings would amount to a total of 36.2m ha, about 200,000 ha more than in the end-March Prospective Plantings Report and just 1% below the previous season's high. This was despite well-documented uncertainties over the prospects for US exports.
Dry weather is an increasing concern for the US crop at a key time of the season
According to the USDA's Crop Progress Report for the week ending August 5th, about two-thirds of soybean fields were rated as good/excellent. This represents a downgrade from earlier weeks, largely owing to drier than desired weather in some growing regions, including in South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. Nonetheless, it was still above the previous-year level, when just 60% of crops were rated good/excellent. As of early August more than 90% of fields were blooming, with three-quarters of fields setting pods-both measures are well ahead of average, indicating that crops were developing more quickly than usual. Accordingly, since August is the key month for soybean crop prospects, more precipitation is needed in many regions to ensure good yield potential.
Assuming that productivity is in line with the recent trend, US soybean production in 2018/19 is forecast to decrease by a modest 1.3% from the previous season's record outturn, to 118m tonnes. Another good harvest will provide ample supplies for export to world markets. Although the US is likely to divert a greater portion of its exports to markets other than China, given the current policy situation and its implication for US sales, we have revised down our forecast for US exports in 2018/19, to 55m tonnes (from 56.3m tonnes previously). This would be the second consecutive year of decline, although volumes would still be marginally ahead of the average of recent years.
Commitments for the 2018/19 year are well ahead of 2017/18 levels
Weekly data on US export sales show that as of July 26th cumulative commitments had already reached 10.4m tonnes-nearly 4m tonnes above the previous-year level. Data show that while sales for delivery to China had more than halved, falling to 1.3m tonnes, there were significantly larger commitments on the book for shipment to Argentina, Mexico and a number of Asian markets.
Brazil is on course to smash its existing record for exports
After progressing slowly in the first quarter of Brazil's 2018/19 local marketing year (starting February 1st), Brazil's exports have surged owing to robust demand from Asia, with volumes hitting respective monthly records in May, June and July. This was achieved despite major logistical challenges and disruption to transport flows caused by industrial action by hauliers and brought cumulative exports in 2017/18 (October-July) to more than 63m tonnes, easily the biggest amount ever dispatched in that period. This suggests that the full-year total will easily exceed 70m tonnes, despite a slowdown in spot demand from Chinese importers. Although the outlook for 2018/19 remains uncertain, we have factored in further growth in Brazil's exports to a record 75m tonnes as the US-China trade war continues, allowing Brazil to capture a larger share of China's import needs.
Brazil's 2018/19 growing season will begin amid considerable uncertainty
Brazil's soybean-free period began on June 15th in the state of Mato Grosso and other producing areas. For a period of three months no live soybean plants will be permitted anywhere-in fields, along road networks or around storage and transport hubs. This policy is meant to eliminate soybean rust disease. Following the expiry of the free period in mid-September, the 2018/19 seeding campaign will begin. However, the economic and political landscape could be challenging, with exchange-rate uncertainty, higher freight costs, US-China trade relations and the 2018 presidential election contributing to market uncertainty. The Real has fluctuated significantly against the US dollar in the first half of 2018 and is down by around one-fifth compared with same point last year. On the one hand, a weaker real could-as it has in previous years-encourage expanded acreage through higher domestic prices. Highlighting this point, although export quotations (Paranagua ports) have risen modestly, the increase in local values has been much more significant, at around 30%. While area gains may come from a shift of some area from full-season corn to soybeans in southern regions, it may also be due to the seeding of soybeans on new lands. On the other hand, however, the weaker Real will inflate production costs, including imported inputs such as fertilisers. Furthermore, higher internal freight costs would also negatively affect farmers' profitability in 2018/19.
In another recent development that could impact yields, it was reported in early August that the use of products containing the agrochemical glyphosate, a widely utilised herbicide, had been suspended. A federal judge ruled that new products containing the chemical could not be registered and existing registrations would be suspended within a month, awaiting scientific analysis.
Despite all the challenges that face Brazilian growers, we still expect soybean plantings to expand for a 12th consecutive season in 2018/19, by around 4% year on year. However, there is a risk that some growers will curb their use of inputs in order to trim costs, which could harm yields. At this stage, however, the outlook is highly tentative, and growing conditions across the whole season will be crucial. Assuming that productivity is broadly in line with trend, output in Brazil is projected at a new high of 120m tonnes.
Adverse weather conditions hamper fieldwork in Argentina
In Argentina, the 2017/18 season was one that farmers will want to forget. After hot, dry weather damaged yield potential irrecoverably, heavy rains across key growing regions led to delays to harvesting, crop losses and an erosion of quality. At 35m tonnes, production is estimated to have contracted by nearly 40% year on year. This has significantly reduced Argentina's presence in the export markets for soybeans and soybean meal-despite unusually heavy purchases of soybeans from the US and Paraguay for local processing. Soybean exports in 2017/18 are expected to total only 3m tonnes, the smallest volume in many years and less than half the amount shipped in 2016/17.
A larger area and improved yields should boost output in 2018/19
Prospects for Argentina's crop in 2018/19 are highly provisional, given that the onset of early fieldwork in central parts is about two months away. Our forecasts are based on the assumption that production rebounds if weather patterns are favourable and that the government does not renege on its commitment to gradually reduce export taxes on soybeans by 0.5 percentage points per month through to the end of 2019. Local soybean prices are significantly higher than the previous year, owing to tighter supplies and local currency depreciation against the US dollar. As in Brazil, this is likely to encourage an increase in the planted area. However, yield potential will be uncertain, since the current difficult economic and financial background means that farmers will be much more cost-conscious and could be tempted to scale back expenditure on some inputs, such as fertilisers. Nevertheless, based on potential area expansion, output is tentatively expected to reach 54m tonnes in 2018/19.
Uruguay is a relatively small player among South America's soybean producers. In the 2017/18 season production is estimated to have contracted significantly, to less than 2m tonnes (from 3.3m tonnes in the previous season), owing to the impact of harsh climatic conditions. As in Argentina, growers grappled with hot and dry weather in early 2018, and since this is the time when crops are setting pods, this resulted in area losses and a heavy reduction in yield potential. In some cases there were reports of average productivity being as low as 0.5 tonnes/ha. Growers later had to contend with excessive rains. As a result, the government has declared a national agricultural emergency and activated a fund to assist the worst-affected producers.
Uruguay is a small producer, with the bulk of its supplies exported to China
Since domestic consumption of soybeans in Uruguay is marginal, the bulk of the country's crop is exported, with China by far the largest market. Other destinations include Europe and Argentina, as well as North Africa and the US. Prospects for 2018/19 are uncertain at this early stage, as the seeding campaign is months away. However, based on average productivity and an area of 1.2m ha, output may recover to 3m tonnes.
Paraguay is a small but important exporter
Paraguay is a modest but important exporter of soybeans to a range of world markets. Output has sometimes varied sharply from one season to the next but has generally trended up over the past decade. Despite increasing local consumption, this has resulted in bigger surpluses for export. Furthermore, the expansion of domestic soybean use as a result of increased processing reflects growing international demand for soybean products.
Record exports are likely in 2017/18 owing to strong Argentinian demand
In 2017/18 farmers in Paraguay planted 500,000 ha of zafrina soybeans, following on from 3.5m ha of the much more important primary (zafra) crop. However, with yields from the zafrina crop potentially below expectations, production in 2017/18 fell slightly year on year, to 9.9m tonnes. The EU is the main market for Paraguay, accounting for between 30% and 40% of all shipments, while sales to the Commonwealth of Independent states (CIS), mainly Russia, have risen strongly in response to rising local demand in the region. Elsewhere, markets in Latin America are also important. Based on the current pace of exports, mainly to Argentina, we now expect 2017/18 exports to reach a record high of 6.6m tonnes, up from 5.3m tonnes in the previous season. In the following year a tentative recovery in production is expected, but shipments may dip as Argentina's import demand falls back to normal levels.
Production in China is rising but still accounts for a small share of demand
China is by far the world's largest importer but only a minor producer of soybeans. However, potential has been capped over the years by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players, as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, maize and rice. Nonetheless, the government is keen to boost production of oilseeds, particularly soybeans, at the expense of corn in north-eastern areas as part of a supply-side adjustment programme. To this end, Jilin and Heiliongjiang provinces issued orders in early 2018 to increase soybean planting with the promise of public financial support. Based on an area increase of about 14% year on year, production in China in 2018/19 is projected to reach a ten-year high of 15.5m tonnes. Nevertheless, this still equates to only a small portion of overall domestic needs, the bulk of which are served by imports channelled to the country's vast feed sector.
According to the India Meteorological Department, the government forecaster, cumulative monsoon precipitation in 2018 (since June 1st) was 10% below the long-term average as of August 8th, with data for the country's important states for the cultivation of soybeans, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, showing a similar picture. Despite somewhat disappinting rains sowings are well advanced, with government data pegging progress complete on 11m ha by August 3rd, ahead of the year-earlier performance and the five-year average. This was in contrast to rice, the main kharif crop, which was slightly behind on both measures. Based on an expected modest expansion of area for the full season and on the assumption that the monsoon is broadly favourable, production is projected at 12m tonnes, up by 9% year on year.

Stocks and prices
Following the previous season's exceptionally strong gains, global ending stocks are forecast to remain fairly flat in 2017/18, at about 120m tonnes-the largest on record and equivalent to a stocks/use ratio of 36%. While we expect some drawdown in stocks in South America, mostly in Argentina, this should be offset by a heavy increase in the US. Elsewhere, a modest fall in stocks is likely in China as consumption continues to rise and import volumes dip. In 2018/19 the global soybean market is expected to tip back into surplus, led by increases in Argentina-assuming a much improved crop-and the US.
At the time of writing there remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding world soybean markets, owing in part to rising global trade tensions. Following the Chinese government's imposition of a 25% tariff on imports of US soybeans on July 6th, the Chicago soybean futures market fell to just US$8.14/bushel in mid-July, the lowest level in almost ten years. However, this appeared to be an overreaction, and prices rose higher over the next two weeks to reach a monthly net increase of 5%. Signs of firmer demand from other buyers, including the EU, have helped to shore up prices in recent weeks. Nevertheless, nearby futures were still trading at around 17% below the 2018 peak (recorded in early March), reflecting market concerns about future demand.
There were contrasting trends in export quotations in the past four weeks. With export premiums easing somewhat more recently on worries about future demand prospects, fob quotations at Gulf ports were up by a relatively modest 3%, to US$343/tonne. In contrast, offers in South America remained high. Export premiums in Brazil have rocketed higher on prospects for additional demand from China as that country scales back purchases from the US. After initially falling, basis levels in Brazil moved higher. Together with gains in US futures, export prices (Paranagua) were up by 5% over the month, to US$403/tonne-some US$60 higher than at Gulf ports. However, at that level there was very little interest from Chinese crushers, with many covered until October owing to ample domestic stocks and depressed margins.
In Argentina, basis levels were also firmer compared with a month ago, with Up River prices for export at about US$394/tonne fob, representing a month-on-month increase of around 7%. With the country's exportable surplus having been dramatically reduced by the smallest outturn in around a decade, quotations were largely nominal.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand by an average of 1.2% per year in 2017/18-2018/19 (years ending September 30th)-below the annual average of 1.7% growth recorded over the previous five seasons. Increasing global consumption will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are adopting the food and drink habits of developed countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift as a sweetener in food and beverages and a binding and preserving agent in processed foods.
However, the slowdown in demand growth stems from several factors, which are likely to remain in play over the medium term. Heightened awareness of the health implications of excess sugar in diets is putting pressure on consumption growth amid consumer calls for the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in an increasing number of markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products. These taxes have the potential to suppress sugar demand, although their impact will vary according to the level of taxation, the rigour of implementation and the elasticity of consumer demand. In addition, the growing supply of cheaper, starch-based alternative sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (where the market was liberalised in September 2017) will limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
China will remain a key consumer, but growth is set to moderate
Demand in China will continue to expand more rapidly than the global average. However, we expect the rate of growth to moderate, to 2.4% in 2017/18 and 2.2% in 2018/19, as the market matures. Consumption growth will also be held back by the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners and rising concerns among wealthier consumers about the health implications of excess sugar in diets.
Import demand will be constrained by higher domestic output and the government's protectionist policy agenda. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government reduced import permits in mid-2017 to 1m tonnes/year (t/y), roughly half the previous level, and raised duties on some out-of-quota sugar imports from 50% to 95% in May 2017. Initially these tariffs applied only to imports from the largest global producers, but the rules were amended in August to apply 90% duty to all out-of-quota imports. Sugar imports fell by 25% year on year in 2017 to their lowest level since 2010, and even assuming China grants some tariff exemptions, a further drop is likely in 2018-19. However, China will be unable to scale up domestic production anytime soon to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high levels of stocks. It will therefore continue to make purchases overseas, and with prices higher in China than the global norm, the country will remain a reasonably attractive export destination.
Urbanisation and income growth will drive Indian consumption
Potential consumption growth in India has been constrained in recent years by unsupportive policy moves (including the removal of some consumer subsidies) and high prices following the drought in the 2016/17 season. However, domestic prices have fallen sharply since mid-2017 as domestic production has rebounded. Amid pressure from producers to support prices, the government has hiked import duties, imposed stockholding limits on mills and approved plans to create a buffer stock of some 3m tonnes. These measures, coupled with the onset of the festive season in mid-2018 and a recovery of demand among bulk consumers, have lifted domestic prices. Even so, we expect domestic prices to remain well below the levels recorded in 2016-17. This subdued price environment, together with rising incomes and further urbanisation, will support consumption growth, with demand forecast to reach 25.7m tonnes in 2018/19, growing by 2% year on year.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is mixed. Demand growth in the more developed countries (such as Malaysia and South Korea) is expected to slow, but rising income in populous developing countries (such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam) will offset this. However, even in these developing countries demand will be tempered somewhat by policy moves. Tax measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines will soften demand growth, with Thailand and the Philippines introducing sugar taxes in recent months. Several other Asian countries are considering similar moves, and the prospect of a tax hike will limit investment in sugar-reliant food- and drink-manufacturing industries. Sugar demand will be further dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry towards cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer of such sweeteners) seeks export markets. In light of these pressures, we expect demand growth in Asia (excluding China and India) to moderate to a yearly average of 2% in 2017/18-2018/19, down from average annual growth of 2.7% growth over the previous five years.
Health warnings may eventually dent developed-world demand
The liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farm-gate prices and export caps were abolished-has limited the need for imports and brought European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. Although lower prices should support demand, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based alternative to sugar) was also liberalised in 2017, and this is likely to gradually steal market share in the sweetener industry. Indeed, Europe's largest beet producer, Germany's Südzucker, has announced plans to start making a sweetener with a lower sugar content.
Health concerns are spurring this shift away from sugar. In many EU countries average consumption levels of sugar are already far higher than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In an effort to tackle this, in April the UK introduced a tax on sugary drinks, and the French government intends to hike its so-called soda tax in 2018. The WHO scrapped its non-binding recommendation to impose a sugar tax in May, calling instead on governments to improve labelling and regulate the marketing of sugary products. Regardless of policy interventions, we expect consumer pressure to make manufacturers wary of using excess sugar in their products. This will reduce sugar consumption over the medium term, and we expect sugar demand to remain broadly flat in 2017/18-2018/19-despite low prices, population growth and rising incomes.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase on the back of population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation. Several countries (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. However, inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and most will be unable to compete with cheap imports. Aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa is therefore expected to remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. Nonetheless, demand growth will be limited by logistical bottlenecks in some African markets. A sugar tax came into effect in South Africa in April 2018, but amid pressure from food and drink manufacturers it has been set at just 10%, and we doubt that it will have a significant impact on overall sugar demand.
Policy changes will shift global sugar trade dynamics
The overhaul in 2017 by the EU of its sugar policy will drive its emergence as a net exporter. Exporters in the EU will focus in the near term on capturing market share in European countries with a sugar deficit. This will limit exports from the EU to the global market but will also crowd non-EU producers out of the European market. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hit hardest by this shift. Some smaller producers have increased their market share in China since the May 2017 tariff regime was introduced, but they are unlikely to retain this market under the new rules. Several producers (notably India) are, however, hoping to negotiate tariff exemptions with China. Elsewhere in Asia, trade patterns will be influenced by the liberalisation of sugar sales under the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which will probably cause less efficient producers (such as Vietnam) to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade in North America is likely to increase following a trade deal agreed by the US and Mexico in mid-2017.

Supply
We expect global sugar production to increase sharply in 2017/18, by 11.7% year on year, supported by another year of strong production in Brazil (the world's largest producer) as well as favourable crop-growing conditions in key producing countries in Asia and longer processing seasons in Europe. This is generating the largest global surplus in several years and is weighing heavily on prices. Most of the world's sugar producers are therefore failing to break even. Cane is being diverted to other industrial uses, notably ethanol production, where possible, but financial pressures will put some mills out of business over the coming years. However, this is unlikely to bring the market back into balance in 2018/19. Increased cane acreage and greater access to high-yielding inputs will deliver another strong harvest in 2018/19 in most markets. We therefore expect production to remain well above the five-year average, at 180.5m tonnes. The modest decline in global output, of 3.7%, is driven almost entirely by a drop in supply from Brazil, whose market share is forecast to fall to 19%, from 23% in 2012/13, as millers in that country are able to divert cane to the more profitable production of ethanol. Adding to this, drought in Brazil's crucial Centre South region and low investment in crop care are damaging the harvest, prompting to a downward revision to our projected Brazilian output in 2018/19.
Trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by production levels in countries such as India, which swing between being importers and exporters. The bulk of India's output is consumed domestically, but a strong post-drought crop recovery in 2017/18 is likely to lead to higher exports; much of this will probably go to emerging markets with costly local production. However, with domestic prices in India having rebounded fairly strongly in recent months (significantly above global prices), producers are reluctant to export, and overseas sales in 2017/18 are likely to be relatively small. In 2018/19, though, high stocks and a subsequent year of domestic oversupply will force exports from India sharply upwards. Shaped by these dynamics, we expect trade to edge up only slightly in 2017/18, to 59.2m tonnes, before increasing more sharply in 2018/19 to 60m tonnes. These levels of trade are higher than the average over the previous five years. There is, however, a downside risk of further protectionism in the sugar industry as governments attempt to shield their local manufacturers from cheap imports, and this could act as a major weight on trade flows.
Output in Brazil will be determined by price dynamics
Brazil had a strong cane harvest in the local 2017/18 season (April-March), and the diversion of cane to the sugar industry was above the historical norm of 44%, at around 46%. Production is therefore forecast to remain relatively high, at 38m tonnes in 2017/18 (compared with an average of 37.7m tonnes over the past five years). We then expect production to decline fairly sharply in 2018/19, by around 6m tonnes, amid drought in the crucial Centre South regions, a lack of investment in aging cane fields and low global sugar prices. Although these price pressures will be felt among sugar producers worldwide, we expect a drop in sugar output to be particularly pronounced in Brazil, because its producers can easily switch to ethanol production.
However, ethanol production cannot absorb all of the country's cane supply, and domestic prices of the biofuel are already tumbling as demand fails to keep pace with surging supply. There is a risk that ethanol prices will drop below sugar prices, particularly if the newly elected government caps fuel prices, which would prompt producers to switch back to sugar and sell more supplies into the saturated global market. However, this is not our central forecast, based on the assumption that oil prices will remain relatively high (thereby boosting demand for ethanol in Brazil) and that the depreciation of the Real will be fairly modest (thereby failing to provide a significant incentive for dollar-denominated sugar exports).
A strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
Production in India is expected to reach an all-time high of 31.2m tonnes in 2017/18, amid favourable growing conditions. However, producers are unable to break even in the current price environment, and millers' arrears to farmers are estimated to have reached some US$3.5bn. The government has provided a bail-out package to millers, but this covers just 40% of existing arrears. Some casualties (particularly among the most debt-ridden mills) are likely, and the government will remain under political pressure from both millers and farmers to intervene.
Policies designed to restore balance in the local industry include removing export duties, setting a price floor for domestic sugar prices, subsidising a portion of millers' contracts with farmers and subsiding loans to increase ethanol production capacity. These measures are yet to have much impact on the level of oversupply or prices, however. The government is attempting to find new export markets, but low global prices mean that producers will still struggle to break even. With the government in effect subsidising an over-supplied and unprofitable domestic market, it will eventually have to allow some producers to fail. However, this correction will not happen in 2018/19, and with cane supply set to remain plentiful, we expect sugar production to remain high by historical standards, at 30m tonnes in 2018/19.
Brisk EU production growth following sectoral liberalisation
In Europe, sugar output is poised for brisk growth as producers take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system. Under the new regime, which came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 season, producers (led by France and Germany) will extend their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity without significant additional investments. This will be supported by favourable weather conditions and higher supplies of beet, with some integrated sugar companies reporting that the area under cultivation has been increased by 15% year on year in 2017/18. Cane supply will remain high in 2018/19 owing to the large acreage under plantation, and this will sustain decent production of 19.6m tonnes in 2018/19. However, European producers are struggling to break even in the current price environment, with Südzucker reporting a 49% drop in profits in the first quarter of 2018. Weak global prices, coupled with the fact that the liberalisation of the sugar industry has removed the premium at which European sugar was previously traded, will eventually force some producers out of the market.
In Russia, production will continue to benefit from the significant investments that have been made in modernising sugar factories in recent years. After favourable growing conditions in 2017/18 led to record-high production, though, both cane acreage and yields are expected to fall in 2018/19, thereby dampening sugar output. Production will continue to exceed domestic consumption, but soft demand in Central Asia (Russia's main market) will lessen its export potential.
Output in Thailand is recovering but pressures are mounting
Thai sugar production is surging as both crop acreage and yields exceed the long-run averages. We expect output to reach a record-high of 13.4m tonnes in 2017/18, before dipping slightly in 2018/19 to 13.1m tonnes as more cane is diverted to the production of ethanol. This diversion reflects mounting pressures in the sugar industry, which was formally liberalised in early 2018 after Brazil successfully argued that Thailand was violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free competition. Quotas for sugar production will therefore be phased out and the domestic price-fixing system will be revoked. Mills are, however, still obliged to reimburse farmers if the final sale price drops below a pre-agreed level. This protects farmers from global volatility, but with global prices at their current lows, mills are struggling to turn a profit. This will lead to some consolidation in the industry. Moreover, weather-related risks are rising as farming moves towards more drought-prone interior regions.
China's output will rise but will still fall short of government targets
After falling sharply in 2013/14-2016/17 owing to adverse weather conditions and the impact of rapidly rising costs for labour, land and farm machinery, China's sugar output recovered in 2017/18 on the back of more favourable rains and some government support in the form of soft loans. However, producers are still operating at a loss. Production costs have increased owing to higher prices for fertilisers and pesticides, and prices have come under pressure from a rebound in local output and global oversupply. Indeed, Chinese sugar futures reached a nine-year low in July. The government has been quick to intervene to protect local producers by hiking import duties. The latest tariff hike is unlikely to have much impact in 2017/18 as the requisite imports have already been purchased, but it should provide some support to domestic prices in 2018/19. Even so, prices will remain too low to spur much investment in the sector. In addition, the sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high, and sugarcane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. We therefore expect that China will fall far short of achieving the 10% annual supply growth that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals. Nevertheless, owing to more favourable growing conditions we expect output to rise modestly, to an annual average of 10.4m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19.

Stocks and prices
After successive supply deficits and a period of relatively high global prices, global sugar stocks shrank to 87.4m tonnes at end-2016/17. As the market swings back into a significant surplus, which is forecast at 14m tonnes in 2017/18, we expect stocks to recover to their highest levels in over five years, at 101.4m tonnes. Another surplus in 2018/19, although smaller at 4.6m tonnes, will push global stocks to 106.1m tonnes. Amid subdued consumption growth, the stocks ratio is forecast to exceed 60% by 2018/19. Even so, the uneven distribution of these stock reserves will not always be available to the market, and occasional supply squeezes are possible.

Prices will drift higher, but slowly and from a low base
The prospect of significant oversupply in the sugar industry over the coming years is heaping pressure on prices. Global sugar prices fell to an average of 16 US cents/lb in 2017, down by 11.3% year on year and more than 30% lower than the 2016 peak of 23 US cents/lb. Prices have remained under significant pressure in the first half of 2018, dropping to a four-year low of 11.14 US cents/lb in April. The lacklustre price recovery in mid-2018 was short-lived, with prices falling back to 11.24 US cents/lb in late July as expectations of muted global demand set in.
Brazil is the only producer able to act as a shock absorber, given millers' ability to divert significant cane supply to ethanol production when prices drop. However, owing to Brazil's falling market share, this is insufficient to raise prices, and the link between ethanol/sugar price parity has therefore become less significant globally as a floor on sugar prices. As a result, prices are forecast to remain under considerable pressure in the coming months. Far-reaching policy interventions by Asian governments are also likely to keep unprofitable producers in the market and delay the market correction.
However, we retain our view that prices will gradually drift higher over the next three years. We expect the sugar-trading market to begin pricing in more risk, particularly as regions highly exposed to weather shocks gain prominence in global supply. More fundamentally, the market will gradually tighten over the medium term as costlier producers are forced out of the market. With traders taking their price cues from markets some two years ahead, this will provide some support to prices. Overall, we expect prices to average 12.6 US cents/lb in 2018, before a gradual recovery to 14 US cents/lb by early 2020. Risks to this forecast are to the upside, as weather-related disruption in South America, Asia or Europe could tighten markets and lift prices much more sharply.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Global sunflowerseed oil consumption growth was always likely to slow in 2017/18, following record year-on-year growth of 15.1% in 2016/17. Nonetheless, consumption continues to outperform our expectations, and we now expect overall consumption in 2017/18 to expend by some 2.6% on the previous year, reaching 18.7m tonnes. This momentum is likely to be maintained into the 2018/19 season, with consumption expanding by a further 3.3% as sunflowerseed oil remains competitive against other oils. That said, lower production expectations may constrain growth somewhat in 2018/19.
Improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
The price discount of sunflowerseed oil to rapeseed oil continues to widen, although soybean oil has become more competitive. Consumption in the EU remains buoyant, with a further increase in our 2017/18 consumption estimate to 4.7m tonnes. In 2018/19, however, consumption may be constrained by local availability. Although imports could conceivably cover some of this gap, at this stage we expect overall consumption to rise by only 1.4% on 2017/18 levels. Trends in soybean oil prices, following US-China trade tariff changes, are likely to have a strong influence on sunflowerseed consumption levels.
Russian consumption set to rise in 2018/19 with higher local output
Sunflowerseed oil is the main vegetable oil consumed in Russia, and changes in local availability influence consumption levels. Local availability is tighter in 2017/18 than in the previous season owing to lower domestic output and a firm pace of exports. This has been reflected in higher local prices, which have also dampened demand. Our forecast of 2017/18 consumption is unchanged. We expect consumption growth to resume in 2018/19, supported by higher domestic production and continued GDP growth. However, changes to trans-fat regulations may discourage the use of sunflowerseed oil in the margarine sector. We currently expect 2018/19 consumption to exceed 2.5m tonnes, representing growth of more than 5%.
Transhipment into India increases
India's previously robust pace of sunflowerseed imports began to slow in early 2018, reflecting the imposition of higher import tariffs. However, import levels have since risen again. In part this is attributable to a loophole in India's import tariff arrangements, which allow duty-free imports via countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Transhipment of oils through these locations is reported to be rising. The impact of the higher tariff rates will depend on the extent to which the transhipment trade develops. At present, we are retaining a relatively cautious forecast of 1.7% growth in consumption in 2018/19.
Consumption growth to moderate in "other" countries in 2017/18
Many countries, including Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt as well as several other smaller states, increased their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Their imports have now slowed, and total consumption of these "other" countries is likely to remain at very similar levels to 2016/17. With sunflowerseed oil production still expected to increase in 2018/19, consumption in these other countries is expected to resume its upward trend, albeit more slowly than previously projected.

Supply
Although we still expect global sunflowerseed oil production to drop in 2017/18, the reduction is relatively small from the record levels seen in 2016/17, with output projected at 18.7m tonnes, as against 18.9m tonnes in 2016/17. With sunflowerseed stocks likely to be below average at the end of the season, 2018/19 sunflowerseed oil production will be more than usually reliant on harvest results. Recent developments in the main growing areas suggest that the 2018/19 harvest will be another large one, exceeding that of the record 2016/17 outturn. There is a need to rebuild sunflowerseed stock levels, but sunflower-seed oil production should still exceed 19m tonnes.
Crush rates improve slightly
Following a mid-season slowdown, crushing activity in Ukraine continues to run marginally above expectations following an improved export outlook for sunflowerseed oil. We have thus revised up our forecast for Ukrainian production in 2017/18. Output will remain below last season's total but will still be the second-highest total ever achieved, reflecting the high base of comparison in 2016/17. The sunflowerseed area for 2018/19 is 3% larger than in 2017/18, despite earlier concerns that falling profit margins would act as a disincentive to farmers. That said, persistent dry conditions in some regions have raised concerns over likely yields. Field reports suggest that sunflowerseed crops are only in fair condition, and most estimates put the total crop at around 14.5m tonnes. This should ensure sufficient raw material to boost sunflowerseed oil output by some 7.3%, but production levels will remain below those seen in 2016/17. With sunflowerseed stocks at low levels, any further downgrading of harvest estimates will have an immediate impact on likely sunflowerseed oil production.
Russia's 2018-19 crop could be constrained by dry conditions
In Russia, crush rates continue to be consistent with our forecast of just above 4.5m tonnes of sunflowerseed oil production in 2017/18: low stocks of sunflowerseed mean that only a small upward revision of this forecast is possible. Planting conditions for the 2018/19 season have been favourable, and a record area has been planted. Normal yields would give a crop of more than 12m tonnes. However, dry conditions in southern Russia are causing some concerns over crop development, and we have thus cut our forecast of 2018/19 sunflowerseed oil output to just over 4.7m tonnes. This would still constitute a new record high but would only just exceed 2016/17 levels.
The outlook for the 2017/18 EU sunflowerseed crop remains firm
The record 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop and high carry-in stocks have supported substantial growth in EU sunflowerseed oil production. Likely 2017/18 production of 3.6m tonnes is easily a new record and more than 10% above 2016/17 output. While sowings were delayed, the area for 2018/19 is estimated to be virtually the same as in 2017/18. Normal yields would give another crop of above 9m tonnes, although this would not be as large as last season's record. In contrast with northern Europe, there has been good rainfall in south-central and south-eastern Europe, where much of the sunflowerseed crop is grown. Some observers are already suggesting above-average yields, although they are unlikely to equal those achieved in 2017/18. We have increased our forecast for EU sunflowerseed oil production slightly in 2018/19 to almost the same level as in 2017/18.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain positive
There is no change to our forecast that Argentinean sunflowerseed production will reach 1.4m tonnes in 2017/18. We continue to expect the planted area to expand in 2018/19, especially given reported difficulties in planting other crops. More normal yields in 2018/19 would result in a crop of just above 4m tonnes. On this basis, we expect sunflowerseed oil production to rise by some 10% that year, supporting higher export levels. Local crushing could be higher if the industry is successful in its efforts to reopen access to the EU market for sunflowerseed oil.

Stocks and prices
Although global sunflowerseed stocks at end-2017/18 will be plentiful, they will be lower than at the end of the 2016/17 season. Current projections suggest that the 2018/19 season will see a further reduction in sunflowerseed oil stocks to just above average levels. However, seed stocks are likely to drop to very low levels during the 2017/18 season before recovering during the 2018/19 season. If crush rates fall below the level we are currently expecting, sunflowerseed oil stocks are likely to be drawn down to meet demand.

Upward pressure on prices is likely to be felt from mid-2019 onward
Helped by strong rapeseed oil prices, prices for sunflowerseed oil increased in July, virtually wiping out the previous months' decline. With comfortable production and stock levels, we expect that prices will tend to be easier over the next two quarters, although any price declines will be small. During 2019 prices should increase as sunflowerseed oil stocks fall and rapeseed oil prices rise further. However, any gains will be constrained by the increase in sunflowerseed stocks and a weak soybean oil market. From the second half of 2019 prices should again be above US$800/tonne.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for nearly 40% of world tea consumption and is consuming ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is growing in other major consuming regions as well, including India, which has offset weaker growth in demand in Europe. Despite press coverage of strengthening consumer demand for high-end luxury tea, this accounts for only a tiny share of the market, with lower-cost varieties continuing to dominate. As such, demand for tea will remain less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities, meaning that tea demand will remain driven principally by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast for tea consumption growth, of 4.7% a year on average in 2018-19, is relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since consumption of tea is driven by structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages.
Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, driven in particular by its increasing popularity in China, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and other "ready to drink" tea beverages account for a small share of the market but have seen rapid growth in sales-notably in the US, but also in traditional markets such as China.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are also the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption, partly reflecting domestic marketing campaigns by various tea boards to promote tea-drinking. The premise behind these efforts is that higher domestic consumption will incentivise producers to lift output in order to raise exports. In producing countries tea will also benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places it will continue to remain a consumer staple. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partly to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2018-19
Tea consumption will remain dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 57% of global demand in 2017, up from 48% in 2010. In China, where growth in tea consumption has averaged over 10% per year in the past decade, we expect tea demand to continue to rise firmly, albeit by a more moderate average of 7.5% per year in 2018-19. Despite this strong growth projection, risks to our forecast are primarily to the upside; average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China 14th in the world. This leaves room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drinks tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drinks retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 26% per year since 2008, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Although ready-to-drink products are gaining market share, particularly in cities, the importance attached to the quality of tea means that sales of loose-leaf tea will continue to dominate the local market.
The latest actual UN data also show a sharp increase in India's tea consumption in 2016, to 1.05m tonnes, accounting for 19% of global tea demand. We estimate that consumption rose by a further 5% in 2017. In 2018-19 we expect strong economic growth to be accompanied by higher household spending, firm consumer confidence and supportive demographics, driving annual average growth in tea consumption of 6% in 2018-19. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share, as well as fuelling overall tea consumption growth.

Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2018-19 by market saturation and weakening demographics. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecasts an overall stagnation until 2027 in European markets (which together account for 4% of global consumption), despite a firmer economic performance, as well as in Russia, which accounts for 2.5% of global consumption and is the world's largest tea importer. Turkey, which accounts for around 4% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest per-capita levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting population growth and steady growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. In 2018-19 we forecast average annual demand growth of 0.8% in the EU and 0.5% in Turkey. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.1% per year in 2018-19, but this is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consump-tion in 2013-16.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for just 2.5% of global consumption, and per-capita consumption is relatively low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea, with the latter accounting for 85% of the country's total tea consumption. It also remains one of the world's largest tea importers. We expect demand to increase by an annual average of 2.6% in 2018-19, partly reflecting our fairly upbeat forecast for US economic growth. Health concerns will also sustain demand for tea, with a continued shift away from carbonated drinks towards other beverages.
Supply
Data from many of the main domestic tea boards for 2017 (aside from China, where data are unavailable) indicate that global tea production continued to rise, but at a comparatively weak rate of 2.8%, with overall growth hampered by three principal factors: weaker growth in China, a sharp fall in output in Kenya and marginal growth in India. We expect global production to accelerate in 2018-19, rising by 3.3% in both years (a downgrade from our previous forecast of 3.8% and 4.1% respectively, reflecting a revision to our projections for tea production in China). The pace of global tea production growth will be lower than in recent years (tea production growth averaged 4.5% per year in 2006-16), with several structural factors preventing faster production growth during the forecast period. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades owing to the higher cost of inputs, which will weigh on investment. In some cases, falling real earnings mean that smallholders' incomes place them within international and national measures of poverty. Investment will also be hampered by overall market perceptions that prospects for longer-term global consumption growth are weaker than those for some other, more fashionable beverages such as coffee, despite the fact that global tea consumption growth will remain fairly strong. In addition, many local currencies will remain weak against the US dollar in 2018-19, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers.
Until recently we had believed that there were downside risks to our projections related to the La Niña weather phenomenon that could have brought unusually cold temperatures to some Chinese tea-growing regions, drought to Kenya and very wet conditions to Vietnam. However, the recent La Niña event appears to have ended after a short-lived and mild episode, removing the risk of a sharper drop in tea production in 2018-19.
Much of the forecast growth in 2018-19 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects rising production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, up from 43% a decade ago. We expect these trends to continue in 2018-19.
Structural efforts in China to bolster tea production
China's tea production rose to 2.4m tonnes in 2016, implying annual growth of around 7%. Output expanded by an estimated 3.5% in 2017 after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China in June, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which is likely to have hampered production.
We have downgraded our forecast for tea production growth this month; although we still expect growth to pick up from 2017, the pace of expansion will be weaker than previously expected (an annual average of 4.6% in 2018-19, compared with 6% previously). This reflects broader government efforts to improve the enforcement of environmental regulations, with local authorities destroying illegally planted tea bushes. Although we do not believe that these efforts will escalate to a level that would lead to a decline in tea production, it will take the edge of what had previously been extremely strong levels of tea production growth, at an average of 9.1% per year in 2004-16. Despite the tighter enforcement of environmental regulations, the government will still seek to foster increased agricultural productivity. A focus on eliminating rural poverty is likely to be accompanied by continued efforts to improve farmers' access to credit from the Agricultural Development Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit co-operatives.
Official efforts to promote innovation, increase the use of technology and lift quality standards will also help to spur production, and better availability and quality should boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Germany and the US are China's main tea export markets; although trade relations with the US have deteriorated in recent months, tea has not been included in the list of items attracting US import tariffs. We also believe that there is potential for gains in productivity, which would also increase long-term tea output growth, since China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 801 kg/ha in 2014-16, compared with 2,153 kg/ha in India and 2,088 kg/ha in Kenya).
India's tea production will grow slowly in 2019
According to data from India's Tea Board, tea production rose by 0.9% in 2017. Output fell by nearly 5% in the first five months of 2018, and industry officials have indicated that this trend continued in June, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state), as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India. We are forecasting a 2% drop in tea production in the full calendar year on the basis that the first half of the calendar year accounts for a relatively small share of production (only around one-third), implying scope for a recovery later in the year. However, if continued poor weather has a negative impact on the tea crop during the peak output months (June-October), we may downgrade our projections.
More broadly, efforts to channel funding to tea growers and to introduce an insurance scheme for smallholders (who account for 50% of production) to protect against falls in market prices and weather-related crop disruption will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment (FDI) in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly and rising input costs have eroded profits, with labour now accounting for half of total production costs (a figure that has grown by 12% in the past three years), implying that in the long term India may struggle to increase output as significantly as other major producers. With several tea manufacturers making losses in India (the world's largest firm, McLeod Russel, made losses in India compared with profits in Uganda, Vietnam and Rwanda), it is unclear how much FDI the sector will attract.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
Tea production in Sri Lanka bounced back strongly after landslides and severe flooding in May 2017, with full-year production actually rising by 4.1%, despite alarmist warnings of a collapse in output following the heavy rains. With early indications of favourable weather conditions and tea production rising by 4.8% in the first five months of 2018, we expect Sri Lanka's tea production to rise by 4.2% in the full year. The government's decision to lift a ban on the use of glyphosate weedkiller (used by all major tea producers) in tea plantations will provide some support, since there had been speculation that some key export markets (notably Japan) would cut imports from Sri Lanka on the basis that farmers had resorted to using a replacement chemical, MCPA, which is more stringently regulated in Japan.
However, there are several structural hurdles that will restrict the pace of growth. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not high enough to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. Local reports also show that fertiliser use has been low, and the risk of industrial unrest persists. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. Reflecting these factors, we are forecasting a weaker rate of tea production growth, of 1.6% in 2019.
A strong recovery in Kenya is likely in 2018
After a massive jump in tea production in Kenya in 2016, with output hitting an all-time high of 475,000 tonnes, poor weather conditions in the first three quarters of 2017 led to a full-year decline in production of over 7.4%. Production is showing solid signs of recovery so far in 2018, with output in January-May rising by 17% year on year. The recovery is even more rapid than we had anticipated, and we expect full-year tea production growth of 13.7%, with output set to register another record, of 500,000 tonnes. In 2019 we expect only modest production growth, of 1.6% year on year, as periodic industrial action over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers-which is now based on the value rather than the volume of sales-undermines profitability and prevents faster growth. The government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, but conflicting interests and a lack of funds will also hinder progress.
Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Other smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes 3-5 years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact of recent price falls on output will be evident only after the forecast period.

Stocks and prices
With consumption growth expected to outstrip production growth in 2018-19, the market balance is expected to fall from an estimated surplus of 120,000 tonnes in 2017 to around 49,000 tonnes in 2018, before slipping into deficit in 2019. Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge how significantly these movements will affect actual physical stock levels. Stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output (mainly of green tea) in China. Although some of the annual production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.
Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya, respectively (essentially black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. For example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have fallen so far in 2018 as production in Sri Lanka and Kenya have risen, while prices at the Kolkata auction have fallen as Indian output has declined.

Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes. There is currently no futures market, although the latest meeting of the FAO Inter-governmental Group (IGG) on Tea, which took place in May, discussed the feasibility of introducing one in an effort to address price volatility and differentials between individual tea auctions. However, given that the IGG meets fairly sporadically (usually once a year), we do not expect the introduction of a futures market within the forecast period. Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat in 2018-19
Average tea prices fell from US$3.17/kg in the fourth quarter of 2017 to US$2.91/kg in the first quarter of 2018, with prices stabilising around those levels in April-May. We are forecasting a moderate rebound during the third quarter before a slight retracement in the fourth quarter. However, this will be insufficient to prevent a full-year decline in average prices. After having risen by 17.8% year on year in 2017, to an average of US$3.1/kg, we expect average prices to fall by 5.6% in 2018 and by 4.1% in 2019 as production recovers.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has nearly tripled since the 1960s, to more than 730m tonnes in recent years. However, gains in demand, mainly for food and milling purposes, have failed to keep pace with increases in production, resulting in a five-year period of stock accumulation between 2013/14 and 2017/18 (local marketing years). Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been driven by a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has generally outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and the manufacture of starch and ethanol. Global wheat consumption is expected to increase only fractionally in 2018/19 by 0.6% year on year to 738m tonnes, as gains in consumption for food only just compensate for an expected drop in use for animal feed. While accounting for only a very small proportion of overall demand, the use of wheat for industrial processing is projected to increase, given expectations of further economic growth.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in global wheat consumption for food use has remained relatively consistent over the past decade. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods, such as noodles and Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports in most years. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global food use to rise by 1.7% in 2018/19. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
World livestock feed use is expected to drop in 2018/19
Wheat is the world's second-most important grain for use in animal feed, with annual consumption roughly equal to the feed use of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. Wheat usage is typically equivalent to one-quarter of the amount of maize that goes into animal feed each year. Given shrinking supplies and continued strong competition from maize-especially in the EU and US-we expect feed use of wheat to drop below recent peaks to a five-year low of 133m tonnes. Demand will depend on relative pricing and overall levels of quality. Following huge crop losses across northern Europe, feed-wheat supplies are expected to be much tighter in 2018/19, and demand will potentially need to be rationed. Feed-wheat use in the EU, which accounts for around 40% of the world total, is currently predicted to drop by around 6m tonnes in 2018/19 to around 48m tonnes as users switch to more competitively priced alternatives, mainly imported maize. Strong export demand for barley may limit how much of that grain is fed domestically in the coming season. However, given this season's very short pasture and grazing availabilities, prospects for the EU feed-grain market outlook are still quite uncertain, and much will depend on how price relationships develop over the coming months. Feed-wheat use in South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam could also decline. However, feed use of wheat in China is expected to rise as more sub-standard domestic supplies are diverted into feed mills in the main southern meat-consuming hubs.
A large harvest is expected to contain Morocco's import needs
Wheat is a staple food in Morocco, where per-capita consumption has long been among the highest in the world, estimated at 216 kg annually in recent years. As domestic production is highly dependent on seasonal rainfall, there are occasionally huge swings in output from one year to the next. This was particularly evident just a few seasons ago, when a record crop of 8.1m tonnes in 2015/16 was followed by an outturn of just 2.7m tonnes in 2016/17. With annual domestic needs close to 9.5m tonnes, Morocco is a major buyer on the global market, importing an average of 4.3m tonnes per year, mainly from the EU, the Black Sea region and Canada. After an unusually dry start to the 2018/19 winter wheat planting season, which prevented some farmers from sowing the intended area, abundant rains in recent months have greatly revived crop prospects, and production should be on track to match last season's 7.1m tonnes, including 4.8m tonnes of soft milling wheat and 2.3m tonnes of durum. As part of efforts to contain third-country arrivals, the Ministry of Agriculture announced in early May 2018 that import duties on common wheat would be hiked to 135% (from 35%) until the end of October 2018.
China has imposed 25% tariffs on US-origin wheat imports
Following the souring of the US-China trade relationship in recent months, a number of US agricultural products, including wheat, are now subject to an additional 25% duty on imports into China. With purchases mainly linked to quality shortfalls in its own huge domestic crop and capped by a restrictive licensing system, China is usually not an overly large importer of wheat. Annual imports have recently averaged 4.1m tonnes per year, with the US typically maintaining a 32% share. Buying interest has almost completely dried up in recent months, mainly reflecting price considerations, but with some importers also reportedly wary of the risk of additional checks or holdups when sourcing US wheat. Instead, local buyers have so far looked to secure additional supplies from Russia and Kazakhstan.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, with output climbing to successive highs in each of the past five years. Part of this upswing is linked to a small overall rise in plantings, with harvested area trending marginally higher, but much of it has been tied to better average yields, seen close to 3.5 tonnes/ha in 2017/18, compared with 2.8 tonnes/ha a decade ago. Despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat-seed technology, productivity gains have been achieved almost everywhere as farmers employ ever more advanced agronomic practices. Following extended periods of adverse weather across many key producers and exporters, world output is now predicted to drop by 5.9% from 2017/18 levels to 714m tonnes (as against a previous forecast of 735m tonnes), potentially the smallest crop since 2012/13. We have revised down production forecasts for the EU, Russia, China, Australia and Ukraine, which will more than outweigh an increased US estimate. With damaging weather affecting yields across the world, the global wheat supply outlook has changed quite dramatically in recent months. Despite an earlier build-up of stocks, the sheer scale of the drop in production, combined with a solid demand base, has quickly shrunk exportable availabilities. Prices have begun to rise, especially in Europe, with US supplies gradually turning more competitive. Given current unfavourable conditions in parts of Canada and Australia, there is the risk of further cuts in output forecasts in the months ahead.
A drop in 2018/19 plantings and yields will limit EU production
Cumulative production in the EU is forecast to slump to 135m tonnes in 2018/19, down almost 11% on the previous year and the smallest total in in six seasons. This reflects downgrades in expected yields in northern Europe, the Baltics and Scandinavia. The winter wheat harvest in Germany, typically the bloc's second-largest grower, was finished much earlier than normal. Due to a damaging drought average yields are down by one-quarter compared with the five-year average, with production seen dropping to only around 18.5m tonnes, compared to 24.2m tonnes in 2017/18. Similarly bad conditions have been reported in Poland, normally the EU's third-largest wheat exporter. Amid exceptionally hot weather in recent months, even sharper declines in yields are expected in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Harvesting in France, by some distance the EU's largest grower and exporter, was finished by early August. While production is expected to fall slightly short of the average, cropping weather was generally more favourable than in more northern states, and output is expected to fall by only around 8%, to some 36m tonnes. The production shortfall is expected to limit exportable supplies in the 2018/19 marketing year severely, with exports potentially seen falling to just 21m tonnes, down 6% from last season and perhaps the lowest level since 2011/12.
Russia's surplus will be much smaller in 2018/19
The outlook for Russia has also deteriorated. While the 2018/19 crop is still on course to be similar to the recent average, it will fall well short of the previous year's record. With stocks declining and demand from local feed processors expected to remain strong, the 2018/19 exportable surplus will be significantly smaller, potentially limiting June/July shipments to around 31m tonnes, down by 9m tonnes from the season before but still enough to cement Russia's position as the world's largest single supplier. After downgrades in the previous two reports, we have lowered our production forecast by a further 5m tonnes to 66m tonnes, down 22% on the 2017/18 season. This reduction takes into account the latest official harvest data, which confirm a pullback in yields across all of the major southern and central growing areas. Because of earlier very warm and dry weather the harvest has progressed unusually quickly so far, with almost 30% of the total wheat area complete by the start of the August, with yields down by around 16% from the season before. With freshly harvested supplies replenishing exportable pipelines, July wheat shipments of 3.8m tonnes were easily the largest on record for that month and more than twice as high as a year ago.
Given current competitive pricing, Russia is expected to maintain a strong presence on the world market in the months ahead. Although there is some uncertainty regarding the exact size of the carryover from the previous season, we expect shipments to tail off in the second half of the marketing year, possibly opening the way for additional shipments by the US, Canada and Argentina.
US wheat production is forecast to rise slightly in 2018/19
The US winter wheat harvest was in its final stages in early August. Yields for some farmers have held up surprisingly well given the punishing season-long drought, but there remains much uncertainty as to how many fields were abandoned. The hot weather has also underpinned quality, with protein levels reported to be higher than average in most cases. The acreage report of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) included a surprisingly large spring wheat plantings estimate, seen 20% higher year on year. Rains across the northern plains have been well received, promoting crop development and recharging soil moisture in previously dry areas. While crop condition ratings for spring crops are seen significantly better compared with last year, with 78% rated good or excellent (as against 61% last year), previous expectations for a sharp improvement in yields may not be fulfilled, with crop scouts pegging yield potential in North Dakota and in adjacent areas of South Dakota and Minnesota 16% higher year on year, but 7% below the recent average. Although we have now adopted the USDA's latest all-wheat production figure of 51.1m tonnes (compared with 48.2m tonnes previously), there is a chance of a possible downgrade in the months ahead.
Chinese output to drop in 2018/19
As part of ongoing agricultural market reforms and with a view of capping centrally held stockpiles, China's government recently outlined some further tweaking of its minimum support price programme for 2018/19. After lowering the support price late last year, the authorities announced that purchases of standard (3rd class) wheat between June 1st and September 30th will only be made once the government has confirmed that the average market price has fallen below the minimum price for three successive days. While tinkering with foodgrain price support measures remains a sensitive policy area, the current system has resulted in a sharp build-up of moderate-gluten wheat supplies and the need for costly stockpiling. More radical changes in policy can therefore be expected in the years ahead.
Based on latest production data by province, we now expect Chinese output to total 122.5m tonnes in 2018/19-a five-year low. Excessive rains badly affected yields and quality in parts of Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, where final results were even worse than previously anticipated. Local officials have reportedly been instructed to support affected farmers by procuring sub-standard wheat under the minimum support price programme. It is unclear how much wheat will be procured and exactly what it will be used for, but it is expected to be diverted into feed channels as long as mycotoxin specifications are met.
Spring wheat was an attractive choice in Western Canada
Updated data from Statistics Canada include a modest downward revision to projected 2018/19 wheat sowings, with the switch away from canola not quite as big as expected early on in the season. However, at 10m ha the all-wheat area was 10% larger than a year earlier and the largest in five seasons. Crop conditions were mixed across the three main Prairie producing provinces. Soil moisture was variable, with dryness a particular concern in southern Alberta and central parts of Saskatchewan, where drought has lingered for months. Crops have generally developed faster than normal and harvesting will start soon. We maintain our existing production forecast of 31m tonnes in 2018/19, up some 3% on the previous year.
Early dryness is a concern in Australia
Parts of eastern Australia have continued to endure extremely dry weather in recent months, with New South Wales and Queensland worst affected. New South Wales, which is sometimes Australia's second-largest wheat producing state, recorded the driest July since 2002, with rainfall below average in each of the past seven months. While rains have been better in Western Australia, sub-soil moisture levels are below average almost everywhere, and further rains will be required over the coming weeks and months. We have reduced our production forecast by 2.5m tonnes to 20m tonnes, almost 6% down on the 2017/18 total and potentially the smallest total since 2007/08.

Stocks and prices
Following five consecutive increases, the world wheat carryover is forecast to contract by 9.1% by the end of 2018/19 to around 245m tonnes, still the second-highest ever and 8% higher than the previous five-year average. Because of downgraded crop forecasts for a number of countries, including the EU and Russia, we have revised down our forecast by 10m tonnes compared with our previous projection, signalling an even sharper than previously anticipated tightening of stocks.
However, stockpiles in China are expected to grow even larger, seen rising by as much as 5% to 132m tonnes, equivalent to more than half of the global total. Since stocks there will only ever be used to satisfy local demand, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. The USDA recently announced that its supply-and-demand outlook would at some point in the future include such estimates. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to measure stocks in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supply. Cumulative stocks in these countries are expected to tighten by 23.1m tonnes to 58.9m tonnes, a 28% year-on-year decline. The major exporter stocks figure is slashed by 11.7m tonnes from previously as a combination of smaller crops and a relocation of export demand pushes stocks to multi-year lows in each of the eight countries. A smaller exportable surplus and the need to ration demand away from feed channels is expected to provide a floor to prices going forward, especially in the event of further crop downgrades.

The recent slump in prices has been undone
World wheat markets have become more volatile in recent months. Earlier bearish sentiment in global commodities, linked mainly to frosty US-China trade relations, seeped over into wheat prices in May and June. However, as traders began to focus on increasingly tight wheat supply-and-demand fundamentals, markets across the world turned sharply higher in July and into early August, with average milling wheat prices up by around 13% during the past month. The bull run was sparked by successive downgrades to crop estimates for Europe and the Black Sea region, where much tighter availabilities in the season ahead will have major implications for the world balance sheet, including demand rationing and a shift in global trade flows.
The sheer scale of the production shortfall in some parts of the EU suggests that the wheat market has bottomed out and price risks are now biased to the upside. Whether prices now push higher or stabilise close to current levels will depend largely on the final results from northern hemisphere harvests, and perhaps more particularly the exact size of Russia's 2018/19 surplus. Average prices are expected to spike higher in 2018, but assuming Russian shipments remain high in the coming years, world prices are expected to show only limited upside potential over the remainder of the forecast period.

Full text: South Africa--highlights: Political outlook
The ousting of Jacob Zuma as president by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in February 2018, and his replacement by Cyril Ramaphosa, a more pragmatic and reputable figure, has positive implications for politics, society and the economy. Mr Ramaphosa faces a range of challenges, however, including boosting the economy, clarifying policy uncertainties and rebuilding ANC unity ahead of the next election in May 2019. Mr Zuma's departure will buoy ANC prospects, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the party to secure another majority in 2019-albeit with a smaller share of the vote than in 2014, when it won 62.2%-thereby handing Mr Ramaphosa a full five-year term, as well as a personal mandate to press ahead more vigorously with economic reforms.

South Africa's business environment ranking falls to 56th in 2018-22, as improvements in market opportunities and infrastructure are offset by a deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and taxes. Supporting factors include a sound banking system, disciplined monetary policy, investment in infrastructure and an expansion of the black middle class population. Key constraints include skills shortages, frequent strikes, strict labour laws and the burden of complying with black economic empowerment regulations. Other key areas of controversy are a new mining charter, which loosens the rules in some areas while tightening them in others, a new investment law, and a proposal to embrace expropriation without compensation to speed up land reform, although we believe that any such expropriation will be limited in extent.

South Africa's economy, being relatively small and open, will remain vulnerable to global developments and commodity price fluctuations. Growth will pick up from 2019 onwards, driven by consumption and investment, and improving sentiment. However, the rate of expansion will be too slow to bring down the high unemployment rate, which continues to constrain aggregate demand. Fiscal consolidation will also impinge on growth. Global developments will put pressure on the rand, but the inflation outlook is relatively benign, and we expect interest rates to move within a fairly narrow band. The twin deficits on the budget and the current-account will trend lower in 2018-22.

South Africa's population growth rate will remain muted in 2018-22, averaging just 1.1% a year, owing to the adverse impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The number of new infections and the annual death toll from AIDS are both on downward trends, and life expectancy is rising, helped by the expansion of treatment programmes, but the damage will persist into the medium term. The labour force will grow at a faster rate than the overall population, highlighting the urgency of job creation. Rapid urbanisation will present planning challenges, but will bolster aggregate demand and business opportunities.

South Africa's market will expand during the forecast period as the black majority is increasingly drawn into the mainstream commercial economy, boosting demand for goods and services across a wide range of sectors. Nonetheless, high levels unemployment will continue to be a drag on aggregate demand, aggravated by fiscal consolidation and the limited scope for monetary loosening. Opportunities will increase during 2018-22, driven by an uptick in growth, the expansion of the black middle class, higher levels of financial inclusion, the rollout of low-cost housing and improved electricity supplies.

Growth will quicken to 4.1% a year in 2031-50, as the ICT revolution gathers momentum, and African integration deepens. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period, owing to a combination of skills shortages and investment in new technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it held its first all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. However, support ebbed from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004 to 62.2% in 2014 and a worst-ever 53.9% in municipal elections in August 2016. Jacob Zuma assumed the presidency in 2009, before standing down in February 2018, in favour of Cyril Ramaphosa, who will serve until the next election in 2019 (and beyond, if the ANC retains power).
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and an executive president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The 400-member National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is fully independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog, the Public Protector, and for independent commissions on human rights, gender equality and the restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: Boosting growth, creating jobs, advancing black economic empowerment and reducing inequality-while maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline-are the main policy aims. The presidency of Mr Ramaphosa heralds deeper economic reform, but divisions within the ANC, and the approach of the 2019 election, mean progress will be erratic and uneven. Reforms to mining laws can be expected, but the labour market will remain rigid and marked by frequent strikes, exacerbated by the trade unions' political power. Skills shortages will persist, reflecting weaknesses in education. The environment for private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, and opportunities for public-private partnerships will arise, but policy uncertainty will persist, especially over property rights, after the ANC voted to support expropriation without compensation. However, this may require a constitutional amendment and is not certain to be implemented.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st-although some essentials are zero-rated. Apart from increasing VAT, the 2018/19 budget also lifted fuel duties, but the corporation tax rate, of 28%, and income-tax rates, are unchanged. Planned special economic zones will offer tax concessions.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for around 52% of GDP in 2016. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important, and it is the only region with which South Africa has a trade surplus.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The African National Congress (ANC) has dominated South African politics since the 1994 election brought an end to apartheid and white minority rule. The party won another comfortable victory in May 2014, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela (1991-97), Thabo Mbeki (1997-2007), Jacob Zuma (2009-18) and now Cyril Ramaphosa, steadily raised its voting share to a high-water mark of 69.7% in 2004, although support ebbed to 65.9% in 2009 and 62.2% in 2014 (and fell to an all-time low of 54% in municipal elections in 2016). The ANC continues to hold a large majority of seats in parliament under South Africa's proportional representation system of voting. The party also retained eight of the nine provinces in 2014. The ANC rules in partnership with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in a tripartite alliance.
Opposition: The Democratic Alliance (DA), which draws most of its support from minority voters (white, mixed-race and Indian), increased its share of the vote from 16.7% in 2009 to 22.2% in 2014 and remains the official opposition. The election of Mmusi Maimane as the DA's new leader in 2015 marked a watershed moment in South African politics. As the party's first black leader, Mr Maimane could help to spread the DA's appeal to the majority black electorate, especially in urban areas. Illustrating this, the DA secured 26.9% of votes in 2016's municipal elections. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EEF), a new party led by Julius Malema, who espouses a radical agenda, came third with 6.3% of the vote in 2014. Other opposition groups include the Inkatha Freedom Party and the breakaway New Freedom Party, which are both based in KwaZulu-Natal. Support for the Congress of the People (Cope), which broke away from the ANC to win 7.4% of the vote in 2009, collapsed to less than 1% in 2014 following protracted leadership disputes.

Political outlook: Political stability
The political focus in South Africa is shifting from the major leadership change that took place in February-when the ruling ANC obliged Mr Zuma to stand aside as president in favour of Mr Ramaphosa-to the next election in mid-2019. With the ANC at risk of losing its majority, especially given slow economic growth and high inflation, the party and the president are now expending as much of their energy on preparing for the ballot as on implementing economic reforms, which is perpetuating policy uncertainty. Illustrating this, the ANC's decision to press for a constitutional amendment to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation is geared more towards blunting the appeal of Mr Malema's radical EFF than about advancing socioeconomic transformation. Populism could backfire for the ANC, however, by stifling investment, growth and job creation, leading to lost votes and a lower turnout.
Apart from trying to nullify the opposition, Mr Ramaphosa will remain preoccupied with trying to heal divisions within the ANC, both between his supporters and those still backing Mr Zuma, and between the party's centre and left wing. The latter split, in particular, is re-emerging as a key challenge, after the two factions successfully united against Mr Zuma. Mr Ramaphosa will consequently be obliged to compromise on both politics and policy, given the shortage of time before the next election, which will be held in May 2019.
Despite the obstacles, Mr Ramaphosa will not abandon his reformist agenda and still plans to hold special summits on both jobs and investment before end-2018. Even more importantly, a series of probes into allegations of "state capture" during the Zuma presidency-including a major judge-led investigation that kicked-off in August-are gaining momentum. A recent court ruling against the now-departed head of the National Prosecuting Agency, originally appointed by Mr Zuma, marked a key win for Mr Ramaphosa in his fight against corruption. Adverse findings against other high-profile figures seem probable, leading to a further shake-up in party and government ranks. Mr Ramaphosa will nonetheless work within the law (unlike his predecessor) and will seek to compromise where possible, even at the risk of delay. His installation as president offers the hope of greater political stability and government effectiveness in future-and a rebound in the economy, but his actions will be constrained by vested interests and political imperatives ahead of the next election. Another victory for the ANC in 2019, by giving Mr Ramaphosa a personal mandate for the first time, is likely to herald more rapid progress.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Government effectiveness declined during Mr Zuma's presidency (2009-18) because of a steady rise in corruption and patronage, and his appointment of cronies to key positions in vital institutions, such as the National Prosecuting Agency, which eroded their independence and credibility. The ANC's ousting of Mr Zuma in February 2018, and his replacement by Cyril Ramaphosa, a pragmatic, experienced and reputable figure, heralds a significant transformation, including a crackdown on corrupt networks and the rebuilding of institutional integrity, although progress will be gradual and subject to occasional setbacks, given the embedded nature of patronage networks and divisions within the ruling party. Mr Ramaphosa has, nonetheless, already taken several important steps, such as overhauling the leadership of mismanaged parastatals and suspending the head of the South African Revenue Service (who will probably be dismissed when investigations are completed). Moreover, a ruling in August 2018 by the Constitutional Court, reversing the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as head of the NPA (made by Mr Zuma in 2015), has positive implications for the rule of law.
The Constitutional Court-the arbiter of South Africa's widely respected and painstakingly negotiated post-apartheid constitution-alongside the wider judicial system, also played a key role in holding Mr Zuma to account, and was one of the few institutions, alongside the South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank), that escaped being weakened by the former president. The battle against corruption and patronage will gather momentum after a key inquiry into Mr Zuma's agenda of "state capture"-led by a respected judge, Raymond Zondo-kicked off in August 2018. Backed by a range of other probes, the architects of state capture-including Mr Zuma-face exposure and possible prosecution, although Mr Zondo's inquiry, for example, could last a year or longer.
The framework of South Africa's political system, underpinned by the constitution, is robust, based on a relatively clear separation of powers (between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary) and strong, independent institutions. Despite the serious damage caused by Mr Zuma, the fightback by the judiciary and other organs of state, and by his opponents in the ANC, illustrates the underlying strength of the political architecture. There are, however, some weaknesses that work against effective government. The electoral code, based on pure proportional representation and a party list system, means that there is no direct link between members of parliament and their constituents, which gives Luthuli House (the ANC headquarters) and the executive much greater influence over legislators than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the ANC's large parliamentary majority, coupled with opposition weaknesses, means that many important debates are hidden from public view within the party hierarchy. Trends suggest that ANC dominance will fade, as opposition influence rises, which is positive for democratic deepening.
Political outlook: Election watch
A decline in the ANC's voting share to a record low of 54% at the municipal elections in 2016 highlights the risk to the party's majority in 2019, although it typically does better in national polls, helped by higher turnouts. The ANC will hope that its fortunes revive under Mr Ramaphosa, especially given Mr Zuma's loss of popularity, although leadership change alone may be insufficient unless efforts to crack down on corruption, improve service delivery and spur job creation are successful. Mr Zuma's early departure gives the party vital time before the next ballot, but the damage caused by his presidency will not be simple to rectify. The 2019 election outcome will also depend on the interim performance of the DA and its partners in the metropolitan councils they captured in 2016, but their record so far has been mixed. As The Economist Intelligence Unit expected, the challenges of expansion and of running minority administrations are testing the DA's reputation for stronger governance. We believe that the ANC will retain a national majority in 2019 (with a voting share no smaller than in 2016) and keep control of Gauteng, the opposition's main provincial target. The period of ANC hegemony is coming to an end, despite Mr Ramaphosa's ascent to the presidency, although the speed of the process and the resulting outcome are far from certain.
Political outlook: International relations
South Africa, the most advanced economy in Africa, will play an important role in regional and world affairs, facilitated by a pending (third) stint on the UN Security Council in 2019-20. The country will remain deeply engaged in Africa, particularly Southern Africa, and will continue to support peacekeeping operations in the continent's conflict zones. Zimbabwe will be high on the agenda after disputed elections on July 30th saw the ruling party and the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, retain power, accompanied by a crackdown on the opposition. South Africa will also seek to build closer "South-South" ties, especially with fellow members of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and with other African trade blocs. The prioritisation of African ties partly explains South Africa's decision in 2016 to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which some argue unfairly targets the continent. However, the High Court in 2017 ruled that departure would first require fresh legislation, leaving South Africa's future membership of the ICC in the balance.

Investment in critical infrastructure will facilitate business operations
South Africa's business environment rankings for 2018-22 show a decline in the country's global rating (to 56th) and no change in its regional ranking. As a key emerging market (and the most advanced economy in Africa), with vast mineral reserves, sound banks and a broad commitment to free markets, the country will remain an important business centre. However, improvements in some areas, such as infrastructure and market opportunities, will be offset by declines in the macroeconomic environment and taxes, because of subdued growth and higher tax levels, respectively. Business also confronts a wide range of policy uncertainties, aggravated by political pressures facing the government in the run-up to the next election in mid-2019. Key arears of concern (and dispute) include a new mining charter, which loosens the rules in some areas while tightening them in others, and the decision by the governing African National Congress (ANC) to press ahead with expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform. The latter poses a potential threat to property rights, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects any such expropriation to apply in limited circumstances only. A new investment law is also proving controversial, by limiting the rights of foreign investors to international arbitration. A major leadership change in February 2018, when the ANC forced Jacob Zuma from the presidency in favour of Cyril Ramaphosa, bodes well for the business environment, by heralding a crackdown on corruption and patronage. Mr Ramaphosa has also revived the government's private-sector-led renewable energy programme. However, disputes in the ANC between left-wing interventionists and moderates will resurface, complicating policymaking, after the two factions united against Mr Zuma. Other challenges include strict labour laws, frequent strikes and skills shortages. More positively, South Africa has several robust institutions, such as an independent central bank (the South African Reserve Bank; SARB) and an impartial judiciary.

Business environment outlook: South Africa's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Policy is broadly pro-business, but favourable moves, such as new special economic zones offering tax incentives, are accompanied by tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2020-22: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: A new mining charter offers some concessions to business but other rules are tightened. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the responsibility for handling disputes.
2020-22: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: The 2018/19 budget heralds a modest relaxation of capital controls on outward investment.
2020-22: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes
2018-19: Tough fiscal conditions lead to higher direct and indirect taxes, including a rise in value-added tax (VAT).
2020-22: Efforts continue to streamline and modernise the tax system, and expand the tax base.
Financing
2018-19: South Africa avoids a further downgrade by ratings agencies after committing to fiscal consolidation and parastatal reforms. Local banks remain sound and profitable on aggregate, and a key source of corporate financing.
2020-22: The central bank's continued independence helps to preserve financial system stability. Monetary policy remains prudent and interest rates are broadly stable. The planned nationalisation of the central bank is symbolic.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour laws stay inflexible, despite the negative impact on employment, because of trade unions' political power.
2020-22: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Investment in transport and electricity, both by the state and by private firms, boosts capacity.
2020-22: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness
2018-19: The roll-out of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology, including in cloud computing and high-end data analysis, gathers momentum.
2020-22: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array, a powerful radio telescope with multinational support, giving a wider boost to science and the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.

The macroeconomic environment score declines during the forecast period, pushing down South Africa's global ranking to 67th (from 61st), although its regional ranking is unchanged. Real GDP growth will remain sluggish (averaging just 2.2% a year in 2018-22), but will show a broad upward trend, from 0.9% in 2018 to 3.3% in 2022, driven by consumption and investment. Nonetheless, growth will remain vulnerable to global developments-such as the UK's exit from the EU, trade wars stemming from US-led protectionism and a slowdown in China-and to domestic policy uncertainty. Growth will also be insufficient to bring down the high unemployment rate (currently 27.2%). South Africa's retention of an investment-grade credit rating in March 2018, alongside an interest rate cut in the same month, are growth-positive, but fiscal tightening in the 2018/19 budget (April-March) will act as a constraint. The current-account deficit will remain a source of vulnerability, although it will move within a fairly narrow range of about 3-4% of GDP in 2018-22, as well as showing a falling trend. The rand-a widely traded and market-determined currency-will remain under pressure, mainly because of unfavourable global developments (such as rising US interest rates), although the pace of depreciation will taper off towards the end of the forecast period. Inflation remains comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range, despite the weaker rand and the rising cost of oil, which suggests an interest rate rise is not imminent. We expect inflation to stay within target in 2018-22 (except for possible temporary breaches), underpinned by prudent monetary policy and weak growth in demand.
The challenge of black economic empowerment
A unique, challenging and controversial aspect of South Africa's policy environment is the black economic empowerment (BEE) programme, which aims to redress the iniquities of the apartheid era-whereby most wealth and assets ended up in the hands of the white minority-by gradually transferring economic power to the black majority. Legislation governing BEE includes sector-specific charters and broader-based codes of good conduct, both of which set targets for ownership and other variables. Broadly speaking, BEE requires firms to have 25% black ownership, although the precise figure varies by sector (and foreign subsidiaries are largely exempt from equity transfer rules). Revised BEE codes of practice, which came into force in 2015, cut the number of elements on a company's BEE scorecard from seven to five-ownership, enterprise and supplier development, skills development, management control and socioeconomic development-and reweighted the various components. Alongside other changes, this will make it harder for firms to earn (or retain) a BEE-compliant rating: non-compliant firms will be at a competitive disadvantage when bidding for government contracts or negotiating public-private partnerships.
Apart from the problems posed by changes to the rules, two key questions remain unanswered after nearly two decades of BEE: how long will the policy remain in force, and is a once-empowered company always empowered? New revisions to the mining charter in 2018 offer some clarity to the latter question, by allowing BEE deals that have subsequently lapsed (because of new black owners selling their shares) to count towards a firm's equity transfer target. This marks an important breakthrough, although it is not necessarily applicable to all sectors. Less positively, the new charter plans to lift the ownership threshold in mining to 30%. With regard to wealth transfer, the record of BEE has been mixed: the initial benefits were spread fairly narrowly (helping to create a new black elite), although a drive towards more broad-based empowerment (by including workers and suppliers, for example), is distributing the rewards more evenly. Some company BEE schemes yield higher benefits than others, however, depending on several variables, such as share price movements.

Policy towards private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, but challenges in several areas, many policy-related, will lead to a small deterioration in South Africa's global and regional rankings. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) will become more commonplace, but obstacles such as strict labour laws, elevated strike risks and skills shortages will persist. A return to fiscal consolidation in the budget for 2018/19 (April-March) is broadly positive, but taxes are rising as a consequence. A high level of policy uncertainty surrounding a new mining charter-which eases BEE requirements in some areas while tightening them in others-and about property rights, because of the government's plan to embrace expropriation without compensation (in some cases), will deter investment pending further clarification. Proposals to revamp healthcare under a planned National Health Insurance system are a particular concern for large private-sector providers. Leadership change in February, is a positive move, heralding a clampdown on patronage and corruption. However, the government continues to face the immense difficulty of reconciling the imperatives of growth with those of socio-economic transformation, leading to policy fudges in many cases.
Powerful parastatals (such as the power generator, Eskom, and the port/rail operator, Transnet) will continue to play a key role, despite suffering from weak management, political interference and financial indiscipline. This will limit private opportunity, although there will be some openings for PPPs and independent initiatives, especially in the energy sector. The government is now attempting to strengthen parastatal management but will remain wary of outright privatisation, while proposals to inject private capital into ailing state-owned firms are not certain to advance. The government's industrial policy will continue to offer incentives in some sectors, especially for vehicles, which will be extended beyond the current 2020 expiry date. Tax concessions are on offer to investors in new special economic zones (SEZs), the first six of which were designated in August 2018 (including existing industrial development zones, such as Coega), although some restrictions apply.
Expropriation without compensation unsettles investors
The ANC's decision to push ahead with plans for expropriation without compensation, in order to speed up land reform-which has so far taken place mostly on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis-poses a threat to property rights. However, we believe that expropriation, if any, will apply in limited, clearly defined circumstances only. The government aims to amend the constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation-rather than test whether the existing constitution allows for land seizures-but this will first require a two-thirds majority in parliament, leaving the timing and the outcome uncertain: a vote is extremely unlikely before the mid-2019 elections. Expropriation without compensation, even with clear limits imposed, is still an investment deterrent, until the details are much clearer. Adding to the confusion, a draft expropriation bill, in gestation for several years, will be comprehensively reworked, leading to further delays. Land reform remains highly sensitive, given the iniquities inherited from the apartheid era, but a cautious approach is needed to avoid damaging agriculture and investor sentiment.
Competition policy is becoming stricter
Policy towards anti-competitive practices will become stricter, as the competition authorities (comprising a commission and a tribunal)-led by the Department for Economic Development-intensify their battle against cartels and overpricing. This may yield some benefits for consumers, but the increasingly intolerant approach being taken by the competition authorities-as well as the use of competition policy as a tool to achieve wider socio-economic objectives (such as BEE)-could have an adverse impact on investment. The capacity of the competition authorities is also being stretched by a large number of concurrent, separate inquiries. A new competition amendment bill, initiated in 2017 and currently working its way through the legislative process, proposes to grant the competition authorities (and the minister for economic development) additional powers, such as launching inquiries into sectors with a high degree of concentration, and investigating cross-border mergers on national security grounds (which is becoming a global phenomenon). Not all of the new proposals will be included in the final bill, however, leaving competition policy (as with other policy areas) subject to considerable uncertainty.

Policy uncertainties could hamper FDI inflows
South Africa will remain a key destination for non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa during the forecast period, in a wide range of sectors, driven by business opportunities and the country's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent, especially Southern Africa. This will facilitate a small improvement in South Africa's global ranking during the forecast period, despite the persistence of policy uncertainties. Foreign investors, for the most part, face the same challenges as domestic firms, including strict labour and competition laws, the dominant position of parastatals and concern about future property rights. Conversely, foreign (and local) investors, will be drawn by opportunities for PPPs, notably in renewable energy. A new mining charter, now approved by the cabinet, improves on the mid-2018 draft, but looser rules in some areas are matched by tighter restrictions in others. In a key concession to business, the new charter allows previous BEE deals that were subsequently unwound to count towards the 26% equity threshold, but also imposes new restrictions, such as lifting the threshold to 30%. Investors will welcome greater certainty, but the full impact of the new charter has still to be ascertained. Foreign investors seeking to acquire domestic firms can face particular scrutiny, especially from the competition authorities, which, for example, imposed several conditions on Walmart's purchase of majority stake in Massmart in 2011.
A new Protection of Investment Act, sometimes referred to as the FDI act, which came into force in July 2018 following lengthy delays, is creating new uncertainties. The law aims to provide a more streamlined environment for FDI (compared with previous ad hoc arrangements) and is based on the premise of local and foreign investors being treated more equally. However, this has a major downside, because the act limits access by investors to international arbitration and instead requires that all legal disputes be first dealt with by local courts. Investors may be assuaged by South Africa's constitution and its broadly respected and independent judiciary, but disputes could take longer to settle, with the outcome more uncertain. South Africa's termination (or failure to extend) around a dozen bilateral investment treaties with EU countries, in the belief that they have little impact on actual investment flows, is exacerbating these concerns. The new FDI act appears to be broadly negative, but full implications have still to be determined. FDI will be driven in part by opportunities for PPPs, as well as private-led initiatives, especially in the field of infrastructure provision. For example, private firms, both foreign and local, are playing a leading role in the rollout of renewable energy (especially solar and wind), having invested almost US$14bn to date, with more projects in the pipeline.

Exchange controls will gradually be liberalised
South Africa has progressively loosened exchange controls on capital flows in recent years, by moving from centralised directives towards prudential self-regulation. This trend is likely to continue, although some restrictions will remain in place. Liberalisation stalled during the 2008-09 global financial crisis (as the controls offered some protection, by constraining capital flight), but soon gained new momentum, driven by a new wave of Treasury-led reforms. These include removing the ceiling for outward investment; lowering the ceiling on advance payments for imports; allowing South African companies to open foreign bank accounts without prior approval; permitting banks to invest 25% of their liabilities in offshore portfolio instruments; and offering concessions to foreign firms that set up headquarters in South Africa. Liberalisation again stalled, although the budget for fiscal year 2018/19 (April-March) brought in looser rules for outward institutional investors, especially those engaged in the rest of Africa. Additional reforms are probable during the forecast period, but some restrictions will remain in place, especially given the risks that US-led protectionism-and consequent trade wars-pose to the global financial system.
Sluggish growth combined with an activist industrial policy will lead to protective measures in some cases (in the form of higher tariffs and anti-dumping duties)-such as for steel-although South Africa will seek to remain compliant with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) will progressively implement a free-trade area, but the initiative is running behind schedule because of wide economic and policy divergences between member states. Loftier ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union are unlikely to be realised during the outlook period. The proposed merger of SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) and the East African Community (EAC) into a Tripartite Free-Trade Area will potentially speed up integration by providing a harmonised framework, but a final agreement remains pending. Non-tariff barriers and poor infrastructure links are other serious obstacles.
South Africa (and other members of the South Africa Customs Union) successfully negotiated a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the EU in 2014. The deal will continue to facilitate deeper trade and investment ties, and provides improved access to the EU for South African agricultural exports. South Africa will also retain trade preferences in the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years to 2025. Nonetheless, South Africa's AGOA status will remain conditional on its policies towards trade liberalisation and investment protection. A dispute about South African restrictions on US meat imports, for example, threatened South Africa's AGOA eligibility before the issue was settled in 2016. Similar clashes can be expected in future, especially given US moves towards protectionism: US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from most countries, including South Africa, violate the spirit of AGOA, but retaliation by South Africa could be counter-productive.

Tight fiscal conditions lead to higher taxes
South Africa's score and global ranking for taxes decline in 2018-22, as revenue shortfalls combine with spending pressures to push the tax burden higher. The budget for fiscal year 2018/19 (April-March), for example, lifted the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 15% from 14%, in the first adjustment for 25 years, and also increased fuel duties. This follows hikes in capital gains tax and income tax, including a new top rate of 45%, in fiscal year 2016/17. The corporation tax rate remains unchanged at 28%, however, and is unlikely to be raised, given pressures on corporate finances. Other levies adding to the business tax burden include property taxes, skills development levies, and contributions towards unemployment insurance and occupational injuries insurance.
Additional tax increases are probable during the forecast period, given spending pressures, although the government's room for manoeuvre is now more limited: another VAT hike would be politically damaging and there is no further scope for higher income tax rates (which could lead to increased evasion). Other forms of wealth tax will be considered, but South Africa already relies too heavily on a small number of rich individuals and firms, and instead needs to broaden the tax base. Efforts to streamline taxation, boost compliance and seal loopholes will continue during the forecast period, informed by the findings of the Davis Tax Committee, which produced a string of reports during its five-year probe, ending in April 2018. South Africa's revenue shortfalls also reflect mismanagement at the South African Revenue Service (SARS) under Tom Moyane, who was appointed by Mr Zuma in 2014. However, Mr Moyane's suspension by the new president, Mr Ramaphosa, in March 2018-and his probable removal from office-point to improvements, which could reduce the urgency of tax hikes.
Tax incentives will continue to apply in some cases, including for small firms, which have enjoyed reduced corporation tax rates since 2013. A youth employment subsidy (via tax concessions) from 2014 will remain in place until at least February 2019 and may be extended. A discounted, 15% rate of corporate tax also applies to investors in new SEZs, with the first six being formally designated on August 1st 2018. The 2018/19 budget allocated R350m to cover tax incentives in SEZs. New environmental and health-related taxes will be introduced during the forecast period, as highlighted by a new sugar tax on soft drinks imposed on April 1st 2018, alongside a higher levy on plastic bags. These will be followed by a long-mooted carbon tax, intended to curb emissions, which is currently scheduled to start on January 1st 2019. However, the final details are still pending-and a further delay is probable-given strong lobbying by industry (especially energy-intensive operations) against the levy, as currently formulated. Unless carefully designed, carbon taxes could dent competitiveness without having a significant impact on emissions.

Banks remain sound and well-capitalised
The banking system remains sound and well-capitalised, with a long-term reputation for stability, underpinned by an effective regulatory and supervisory framework, overseen by SARB. Key challenges are slow GDP growth (and hence demand for credit) and a range of regulatory uncertainties. Banks' capital-adequacy ratios remain comfortably above prescribed minimums, and profitability (as measured by return on equity) remains satisfactory after edging up to 16.2% in June 2018, an eight-month high. Despite cheaper credit, strains in the economy pushed up the non-performing loan ratio to 3.5% in June (a four-year high), although there seems little danger of the figure breaching the critical 5% threshold in 2018-22. We expect interest rates to trend mildly higher during the forecast period, with small hikes partly offset by periodic cuts. Local banks will remain a key source of funds for private investment projects, as illustrated by their participation in the financing of renewable energy projects. Other key sources of financing are the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and, to an increasing extent, local development finance institutions such as the Industrial Development Corporation.
The four dominant banks-ABSA (formerly Barclays Africa), Nedbank, Standard and First Rand-are world-class players with strong international links. They are also, to varying degrees, expanding their presence in the rest of Africa, thereby cementing South Africa's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent. Smaller banks are more vulnerable-for example Africa Bank (an unsecured lending specialist), folded in 2014, followed by VBS in 2018 (because of apparent corruption), although the SARB successfully curbed systemic risk in both cases. The withdrawal of Barclays from Africa, largely completed in 2017, poses no threat to the local banking system, although it has now been rebranded as ABSA (its former name). The implementation of an amended Financial Intelligence Centre Act in June 2017, meeting a deadline set by the Financial Action Task Force, removes a threat to the credibility and integrity of local banks and will help to tackle money-laundering. However, the phased implementation of more stringent Basel III regulatory standards in the lead-up to a 2019 deadline, alongside a new financial sector regulation bill based on a Twin Peaks model, may impose additional costs. Key challenges on the policy front are possible changes to BEE rules in the financial sector, which are comparatively loose at present, as well as amendments to the credit act (not yet implemented) that potentially offer a big debt write-off for low-income borrowers. The latter could compromise the ability of banks to price risk correctly. Government plans to embrace expropriation without compensation (for land) represent a fundamental threat to banks (given the amount of land used as loan collateral), although we expect the government to set clear limits on expropriation. The possible nationalisation of the SARB-a rare, privately owned central bank-is unsettling, but would be of symbolic value only, provided its mandate was left untouched. Other, broader dangers include the exposure of banks to heavily indebted parastatals.

The labour market will remain characterised by a strict regulatory environment, partly owing to the political power of the trade unions, and despite its negative impact on job creation. The official unemployment rate climbed to 27.2% in the second quarter of 2018-rising to 35.5% with the inclusion of discouraged job seekers-partly because firms are discouraged from hiring by tight labour laws, including the employment equity components of BEE and the limits imposed on casual, temporary employment. Frequent strike action is an additional deterrent to job creation. A major split in the labour movement between comparative moderates in the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu, an ANC ally) and their more radical counterparts in the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu), formed in 2017 by disgruntled Cosatu members, somewhat weakens the labour voice. However, the split also heralds new challenges for firms, as many unionised workers in the private sector are now Saftu members. The pending introduction of a national minimum wage will have an impact on the labour market during the forecast period. The relevant bill, adopted by the National Assembly in May 2018 following lengthy negotiations at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac)-a tripartite body comprising government, labour and business representatives-ushers in a R20 (US$1.40) per hour minimum wage, most probably starting in late 2018/early 2019. Approximately 5m workers (one-third of the total) may benefit, giving a potential income boost to poorer households, but job losses are a clear risk, which would neutralise the benefits. To mitigate the threat, a lower wage threshold will apply to farmworkers and domestic servants for a two-year period. The existing system of sector-based minimum wages will be retained, despite its complexity, to protect workers earning more than the national minimum. A new Minimum Wage Commission will monitor the impact and make recommendations on future increments (to account for inflation).
Shortages of skilled workers will remain a key constraint
In return for agreeing to a national minimum wage, business secured a commitment from mainstream trade unions to make greater use of pre-strike balloting, which could reduce incidents of labour unrest. To effect the changes, the national minimum wage bill is being accompanied by amendments to other key labour laws, including the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Labour Relations Act (which covers pre-strike ballots). Radical trade unions remain strongly opposed to the national minimum wage, on the grounds of it being set too low, but their objections are unlikely to derail the government's plans. The national minimum wage is clearly an experiment with a high risk of unintended consequences. Skills shortages, exacerbated by HIV/AIDS, will remain prevalent in most sectors, pushing up the premium required to attract skilled workers and leading to the poaching of capable staff. The government, in partnership with the private sector, will maintain initiatives to boost the skills base, but progress will be slow, especially given weaknesses in the education system at all levels.

Parastatals restrict opportunities in transport
South Africa's transport network is well-developed by African standards, despite some bottlenecks, although the strong parastatal presence, including Transnet (for most freight railways and ports), Prasa (for passenger railways) and Sanral (for roads), limits opportunities for private providers. Moreover, weak governance at most parastatals, including irregular tendering and project delays, can be detrimental for infrastructure efficiency. PPPs are, nonetheless, playing an important role, as illustrated by the Gauteng mass-transit railway that opened, in phases, in 2010-12 and which may be extended. The partnership between the privately owned Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa's largest, and Transnet, which operates the railway serving the terminal, represents a different form of PPP. The government's bid to finance Gauteng's highways via a tolling system continues to face resistance from drivers, however, leading to revenue shortfalls at Sanral. End-user pricing models clearly work better for railways (eg, Gautrain) than roads. Three broad themes will characterise South Africa's energy scene in 2018-22: a slow decline in the dominant role of Eskom (the heavily-indebted parastatal firm with a monopoly on distribution); brisk growth in renewables (led by the private sector); and slow growth in electricity demand (because of sluggish economic growth and improvements in energy efficiency). The government's flagship renewable procurement programme, launched in 2011, has attracted investment of about US$14bn to date, mainly in solar and wind, which cut Eskom's share of the power mix from 95.9% in 2012 to 91.1% in 2017. The programme stalled in 2016 (partly because of resistance from Eskom), leaving several projects in limbo, but was revived by the new president, Mr Ramaphosa, in April, leading the energy department to conclude new contracts worth US$4.7bn (for projects initially approved in 2014-15). A new, fifth bidding window may open later in 2018.
The long-delayed update in August to South Africa's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), running to 2030, confirms the commitment to renewables but makes no provision for additional nuclear power. Eskom's coal-fired plants will continue to supply the bulk of base-load power, although the phased opening of new mega plants at Medupi and Kusile (in 2017-23) will be accompanied by the closure of ageing and less-efficient facilities. The new IRP, currently open for comment, marks a key step forward for energy planning, although resistance from Eskom to plant closures (and inevitable job losses) could pose a challenge. South Africa is no longer at risk of power shortages but rising tariffs in real-terms will remain a burden for end-users, while also driving energy efficiency.

ICT sector a leader in Africa
South Africa's ICT market is among the most advanced in Africa in terms of technology and service provision, highlighted by the pending opening of two cloud-computing centres by Microsoft (in Johannesburg and Cape Town) later in 2018, the first by any operator on the continent. Local data centres will reduce problems with latency (delays) and provide new options for firms, such as banks, which are obliged to hold data locally for privacy reasons. Amazon, the world's leading cloud-computing firm, is still considering a local data centre but, in the interim, is investing in a new greenfield project in Cape Town (near the firm's existing facilities), with a focus on cloud computing, machine learning and data analysis, which may open later in 2018. South Africa is also a leading destination for ICT start-ups: out of total African funding of US$558m in 2017 (in 124 ventures), South Africa claimed US$167m (in 42 ventures), according to the GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide. Fintech (financial), e-commerce and edtech (educational) start-ups were the most numerous. Cape Town is emerging as a key ICT hub, helped by having one of Africa's largest, public fibre-optic networks. Key challenges are relatively high end-user charges (although these are falling over time), an increase in cybercrimes-marked by a number of serious data breaches in the private sector-and skills shortages.
In a significant boost to ICT and science, South Africa will host the majority portion of the US$2bn Square Kilometre Array (SKA) complex, a powerful radio telescope in Northern Cape. The first portion of the SKA, a 64-dish radio telescope, known as MeerKAT, opened in July to scientific acclaim following investment of US$332m, mainly from public sources, including from international partners that are part of the SKA consortium. MeerKAT is also at the cutting edge of high-performance data processing, which bodes well for technological progress and digital skills building. MeerKAT will be the central component of the SKA, which will include additional dishes and arrays in South Africa, as well as in several other African countries. Parts of the SKA will also be situated in Australia, bringing the total number of dishes to about 3,000 when complete. MeerKAT will operate independently until it is linked to the SKA in 2023, although the entire SKA project may not be finished until later in the decade. The SKA could offer clues to black holes, dark energy and the origin of the universe.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Boosting economic growth and job creation within a context of global uncertainty, while avoiding macroeconomic imbalances, will continue to be the main task facing policymakers. Adding to the challenge, fiscal policy is becoming tighter and taxes are rising in order to keep debt under control and forestall additional credit downgrades, which will hinder efforts to boost growth. The main medium-term challenge is to overcome structural obstacles to faster growth, such as infrastructure bottlenecks and skills shortages. Targeted industrial incentives will therefore stay in place and infrastructure investment will remain a priority, but wasteful spending poses a threat. Other challenges include the persistence of labour market rigidities and the progressively stricter application of rules against anti-competitive behaviour.
The installation in February of Cyril Ramaphosa as president, and the new president's sweeping cabinet reshuffle, have positive implications for the policy environment. However, Mr Ramaphosa's room for manoeuvre is constrained by divisions within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the approach of the 2019 election. Labour law reform and privatisation will therefore remain sensitive topics, although opportunities will arise for public-private partnerships. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a faster rollout of independent power projects, but hopes for a more business-friendly mining charter are diminishing. Land rights will remain subject to uncertainty, given the ANC's backing for expropriation without compensation, albeit with provisos such as not damaging agriculture. Corporates face the additional challenge of complying with black economic empowerment targets, especially given ongoing changes to the legal framework. Most of the policy conundrums facing the government stem from the difficulty in reconciling the imperatives of growth with those of socioeconomic transformation.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators

Government revenue 26.2 26.4 26.4 26.8 26.9 27.3
Budget balance -4.4 -3.6 -3.4 -3.1 -2.8 -2.6
Fiscal risks are rising ahead of the next medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS) in October because of revenue shortfalls as a result of weak GDP growth and persistent upward pressure on spending, especially in advance of the mid-2019 election. The outlook has therefore deteriorated since the adoption of a relatively prudent budget for fiscal year 2018/19 (April-March), targeting a cut in the deficit to 3.6% of GDP-from an estimated 4.4% of GDP in 2017/18-alongside the February reappointment of Nhlanhla Nene as minister of finance by Mr Ramaphosa. The 2018/19 budget, which lifted value-added tax (VAT) from 14% to 15% in the first hike for 25 years, persuaded Moody's, a credit rating agency, to retain South Africa in the investment-grade category and to revise the country's outlook from negative to stable.
However, positive sentiment is dissipating because of below-target revenue collection in the fiscal year to date-despite tax hikes-resulting from weak economic growth and structural challenges facing the South African Revenue Service (SARS). Spending, by contrast, continues to head higher, aggravated by a three-year wage deal for public-sector workers (based on real-term increases) and the financial demands of struggling parastatals, especially Eskom, the heavily indebted power generator. The Treasury is also working on a stimulus package, which could put extra pressure on the fiscal accounts. We are therefore revising our budget deficit projections for 2018/19 and 2019/20 to 3.6% of GDP and 3.4% of GDP, respectively. The larger shortfalls also mean that public-sector debt may exceed 56% of GDP in both years, slightly ahead of the Treasury's current projections. Our central forecast still sees the deficit retreating to 2.6% of GDP in 2022/23, helped by more rapid fiscal consolidation after the 2019 election and moderately faster economic growth, but the outlook is now subject to greater uncertainty.

Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 10.4 10.0 10.1 10.2 10.0 10.3
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% in March 2018, following an identical reduction in July 2017, but we expect the next move to be upward, most probably in mid-2019. The March rate cut reflects subdued GDP growth and moderate inflation, which is lying comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. However, rising US rates (in 2018-20) and the need to maintain a positive rate differential with the US (in order to attract vital portfolio investment inflows), accompanied by slightly higher inflation and a weaker rand, point to a small rate rise in 2019. Tightening could come sooner if rand weakness propels inflation above the target level. Trends thereafter are forecast to follow the broad pattern of US rates, edging up in 2020 and 2022, with an intervening dip in 2021. South African rates will, nonetheless, remain fairly stable during the forecast period, marked by small up and down movements only. The SARB will retain its inflation-targeting mandate and its independence, even if the government takes the institution into public ownership.

External headwinds (such as a stronger US dollar and rising global trade tensions) and domestic constraints (including high levels of political and policy uncertainty) are stifling economic activity. Real growth slowed to 0.6% year on year in the first half of 2018, leading to a downward revision in our annual forecast to just 0.9% (from 1.5%), assuming a mild second-half rebound. An interest-rate cut by the SARB in March in response to lower inflation is growth-friendly, by offering support to credit demand and household consumption. More stable electricity supplies and satisfactory rainfall in Western Cape, ending a severe drought in the province, are also supportive. However, the boost to confidence arising from the installation in February of Mr Ramaphosa as the new president is fading, given the precedence being given to political priorities ahead of the mid-2019 election.
Growth in 2018 is suffering from a contraction in agriculture-after a bumper harvest in 2017 set a very high benchmark-and shrinkage in mining because of a tough operating and policy environment. Household spending is moderately buoyant, but tighter fiscal policy, especially a rise in VAT on April 1st, will weigh on aggregate demand, as will the persistently high unemployment rate (of 27.2% in the second quarter). Policy uncertainties in several key areas, aggravated by the ruling ANC's stated intention to allow for expropriation without compensation in order to advance land reform, will continue to unsettle investors and dampen private investment. Global uncertainties linked to US-led protectionism are another growth risk, although net exports, which detracted from growth in the first half, will benefit from a recent slide in the rand.
Political developments will be a key variable in 2019, when South Africa holds its next election. Our central forecast sees growth quickening to 1.8%, but activity will be hampered by election-related uncertainties, especially in the first half of the year. Global turbulence, including the UK's potentially disruptive departure from the EU, could also have a negative local impact. Provided the 2019 election is not destabilising, growth will quicken to 2.8% a year in 2020-22, helped by the completion of major infrastructure projects in transport and energy and stronger consumer demand for goods and services, underpinned by the expansion of the black middle class. Structural constraints, such as skills shortages and inefficient parastatals, will nonetheless continue to dampen economic activity, and a negative external balance will weigh on economic growth throughout most of the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side, services will remain the largest sector (69.5% of factor-cost GDP in 2017) and will continue to be a key source of growth. Expansion will remain subdued in 2018, at 1.1%, in line with the wider economy, before gaining momentum in 2019-22. The large banking segment (22.3% of GDP, including real estate and business services) will remain a leading segment and a key source of job creation, bolstered by rising rates of financial inclusion. Retailing/wholesaling (15% of GDP) will rebound modestly in 2018 (after shrinking in 2017), helped by lower interest rates, which are boosting household credit growth, although high unemployment will continue to supress aggregate demand. Transport and communications (9.4% of GDP) will gain from new investment in infrastructure, including in railways, ports and fibre-optic cable networks. The mobile-phone market is largely saturated, with a penetration rate of about 165 subscriptions per 100 people (as of mid-2018), but a transition to high-end services and increased data usage will underpin expansion. Tourism has considerable potential-based on South Africa's varied natural attractions and favourable climate-and is also labour-intensive, although high levels of crime remain a deterrent. Tourism rebounded in 2016-17 after the government started to ease the tighter visa restrictions imposed in 2014-15, pointing to further expansion during the forecast period.
The industrial sector (27.9% of factor-cost GDP in 2017, including mining) will remain a key part of the economy, with growth showing a broad upward trend during the forecast period, from 1% in 2018 to 3% in 2022. Manufacturing (13.5% of GDP) is broad-based by Sub-Saharan African standards, being a key employer and source of exports, although growth will remain fairly sluggish given subdued domestic demand and competition from imports. The key vehicle segment will benefit from new investment, spurred by incentives offered under the Automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), which runs to 2020 (with an extension likely), as part of the government's activist industrial policy. Power supply constraints have now eased, helped by new plant openings, but rising tariffs are a challenge. Manufacturing will continue to face an elevated risk of strikes.
Mining makes a modest and declining contribution to GDP (8.2% in 2017) but accounts, directly and indirectly, for about 50% of export earnings. This leaves South Africa vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and to a slowdown in China. Mining also suffers from labour militancy and a high-level of regulatory uncertainty-especially with regards to new draft mining charter-leading to a paucity of new investment. Despite South Africa's rich mineral reserves, faster growth will require a more conducive policy environment The agricultural sector is small (2.6% of GDP in 2017) and vulnerable to drought, but will continue to make an important contribution to exports (including fruit and wine), agro-industry and employment. However, erratic rainfall poses a high degree of risk: droughts in 2015 and 2016 (partly linked to the El Niño climate phenomenon) led agriculture to contract in both years, before a strong rebound in 2017. Future performance is dependent on both climate and the government's land-reform policies.

Unit labour costs (US$) 16.2 8.0 -1.5 0.8 1.0 1.1
Inflation is forecast to ease slightly to 5% in 2018, helped by sluggish domestic demand and adequate rainfall, including in Western Cape, which will keep food prices in check. The decision by the energy sector regulator to cap electricity tariff rises at 5.2% in 2018 will also curb inflation. However, the VAT increase in April, alongside higher oil prices and recent rand slippage, will put some upward pressure on prices. Inflation will average about 5.3% a year in 2019-22, thereby falling within the SARB's 3-6% target range, apart from possible temporary breaches. Prudent monetary policy, spare industrial capacity, subdued demand, stricter competition laws and efficiency gains arising from infrastructure investment will help to mute price growth. However, rising power tariffs and higher real wages for those in work will prevent inflation from falling more sharply.

The rand depreciated to R14.11:US$1 in August, the weakest monthly rate for more than two years, before crossing the R15:US$1 mark in early September, largely reflecting adverse global sentiment towards emerging-market currencies, driven by US monetary tightening and a stronger US dollar. Slow domestic growth and persistent policy uncertainty are also weighing on the rand, although South Africa's modest level of external debt offers some protection. Fiscal consolidation in the 2018/19 budget (delivered in February) gave the rand a temporary boost by reducing the risk of additional credit downgrades, but the gains have now been cancelled out by emerging-market contagion. The rand will remain volatile, exacerbated by its widely traded status, although we expect a mild rebound from current levels. Our rand forecast for 2018 is revised to R13.21:US$1 (from R12.95:US$1)-leaving the local unit slightly stronger than in 2017-before a further slide in 2019 to R14.37:US$1 (revised from R13.99:US$1) in view of electoral uncertainties. Thereafter, on current assumptions, the rand will stage a more gentle retreat to an average of R16.94:US$1 in 2022.

The current-account deficit will fluctuate within a narrow range of 3-3.6% of GDP during the forecast period, with the gap peaking in 2020 before receding. The structure of the deficit, comprising a merchandise trade surplus and a larger invisible trade deficit (on services, income and current transfers), will remain unchanged. Export growth will be slower in 2018-19 than in 2017, reflecting non-oil commodity price trends and South Africa's heavy reliance on mineral sales. Non-mineral exports (such as cars) will benefit from South Africa's probable retention of trade preferences under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), although US-led protectionism poses risks. The recent slide in the rand is, nonetheless, broadly positive for exports. Imports will grow at a similar pace to exports in 2018-19, spurred by a modest pick-up in GDP growth and slightly higher oil prices, leading to a small decline in the merchandise trade surplus. Combined with a rising shortfall on invisible trade, this will lead to a widening of the current-account deficit to 3.6% of GDP in 2018. Income payments to foreign investors and transfers to fellow members of the Southern African Customs Union will continue to account for most of the invisible shortfall. We expect the current-account deficit to peak at 3.6% of GDP in 2020 before easing to 3.2% of GDP in 2021 and 3% of GDP in 2022, helped by faster earnings growth and a rise in nominal GDP.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in South Africa
Stocks and flows
South Africa is a prime destination for non-oil-sector foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inflows averaged US$3.8bn a year in 2013-17, but showed a declining trend to an 11-year low of US$1.4bn in 2017, partly because of uncertainties about both commodity prices and government policies. Nonetheless, annual figures can vary substantially because of the discontinuous nature of FDI. Inflows peaked at a record of US$9.9bn in 2008, boosted by the US$5.2bn purchase of a 20% stake in Standard Bank by China's state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)-the second-biggest FDI deal to date-behind the acquisition of 56% of ABSA by Barclays (UK) in 2005. Eight years later, in 2013, Barclays brought together most of its African operations, including ABSA, under the Barclays Africa banner, before subsequently announcing its withdrawal from Africa (in 2016) as part of a global restructuring exercise. The sale of Barclays' majority stake in Barclays Africa, primarily to local investors, was completed in 2017. FDI regained momentum after the 2009 recession, rising to US$4.6bn in 2012, buoyed by the purchase by Walmart (US) of 51% of Massmart, for US$2.4bn. Inflows climbed higher to US$8.2bn in 2013, the second highest on record, and remained strong at US$5.8bn in 2014, but weaker inflows in 2015 (US$1.5bn), 2016 (US$2.2bn) and 2017 illustrate heightened investor concerns about domestic and global prospects. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI to be fairly buoyant during the forecast period, averaging US$3bn a year in 2018-22 (and rising towards the end of the period), helped in part by South Africa's status as a gateway to Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa is also a major outward investor, especially in Africa, where local firms have a presence in a wide range of sectors, including services and infrastructure, as well as in more traditional natural resource exploitation. Outward FDI averaged US$6.3bn annually in 2014-17, surpassing inward FDI in all four years, which is pattern we expect to continue in 2018-22.
Origin and distribution
The UK remains a key source of FDI, illustrated by deals with Vodafone and Barclays in recent years, alongside other significant investors such as Germany (Mercedes-Benz and BMW) and the US (Coca-Cola, Ford and Walmart). Investment from non-traditional sources, especially China (ICBC) and India (Tata and Cipla), is growing strongly. Financial services, ICT, tourism, real estate, mining and manufacturing are among the most attractive sectors, helped in some cases (such as vehicles) by investment incentives. FDI in South Africa includes greenfield projects-in motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, food-processing, ICT and beverages-and buy-outs of existing firms (such as Massmart). The economically powerful Gauteng province receives the bulk of inward FDI, followed by the Eastern Cape (including the Coega industrial zone), KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, but the other five provinces attract less interest. New special economic zones may lead to a slightly more even spatial distribution.
Determinants
Several factors drive inward investment, including South Africa's status as the most advanced economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (with close links to several other regional markets), a sizeable domestic market of 57.7m people (in mid-2018), strong tourism potential and world-class mineral wealth. South Africa's preferential access to the EU market, via a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) concluded in 2014, and to the US market, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years to 2025, also helps to support investment. Set against these factors are a number of deterrents, including a high degree of policy uncertainty, labour-market rigidity (and strikes), skills shortages, widespread crime and the dominant position of parastatals in several sectors. Contentious policy areas include a new mining charter and a new FDI law that limits recourse to international arbitration, as well as proposals to allow for expropriation without compensation, which could damage property rights. Privatisation prospects are limited, although openings will arise for independent operators and public-private partnerships, mainly in energy and transport.
Impact
FDI has a strong positive impact in South Africa, especially in key sectors such as automotive, ICT, banking and mining, and has played a key role in boosting exports, facilitating growth and lifting employment. FDI provides capital, allows for the transfer of technology and skills and binds South Africa more closely to the global economy.
Potential
We expect inflows to rise steadily during the forecast period, from US$2.1bn in 2018 to US$3.8bn in 2022, helped by a pick-up in local growth, but global and domestic risks are significant. The impact on global trade and commodity prices of US-led protectionism (under the Trump presidency), the UK's intention to leave the EU (Brexit) and a slowdown in China all have the potential to impede investment flows. Wide-ranging policy uncertainty in South Africa will also inhibit investment, especially in mining, although the government will implement gradual reforms. Inflows will benefit from the government's activist industrial policy, especially in the automotive segment, and from private-sector investment in renewable energy. The retention of South Africa's AGOA status will also facilitate inflows (barring fresh disputes with the US over South Africa's eligibility), as will closer regional integration within the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The rollout of a domestic cable network will boost bandwidth and cut costs, facilitating investment in ICT, including in cloud computing and data analysis. Business-process outsourcing (given an English-speaking workforce in a similar time zone to the EU) has potential but is underdeveloped. South Africa will remain a key base for companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

The population will continue to grow relatively slowly
South Africa's population is projected to grow at a relatively modest rate of 1.1% a year in 2018-22, partly because of the ongoing impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the population to rise from an estimated 56.7m in 2017, to 60m in 2022, including positive net migration, mainly from neighbouring states. The latest official estimates for 2018 show that 7.5m people are living with HIV/AIDS-more than in any other country, and equivalent to 13.1% of the population. South Africa has significantly reduced deaths from AIDS, but progress in other areas, such as cutting the incidence rate of new infections, has been slower than hoped. AIDS-related deaths fell to 115,000 (22.1% of all fatalities) in the year to mid-2018-the lowest since the series began in 2002-from a peak of 293,000 in 2016, helped by the mass roll-out of anti-retroviral drugs. Most of those in need now receive treatment, enabling them to live longer and more productive lives, although the costs are substantial, amounting to about US$2bn a year. However, with an incidence rate of 1.2% in mid-2018 (unchanged from mid-2017), South Africa has yet to hit the key 1% benchmark that would bring about a decline in the prevalence rate. Until this occurs, the number of AIDS victims will continue to grow more rapidly than the total population.
The disease will remain a significant source of mortality into the medium term, imposing costs at the household, corporate and national levels. The loss of trained workers, either through death or extended absenteeism, is particularly damaging in a country so short of skills. This requires organisations to adopt coping strategies, such as increased expenditure on training. Any complacency with regards to AIDS is misplaced; instead, the government needs to consider fresh policy initiatives, in partnership with the private sector, to tackle the issue.
Life expectancy will rise steadily
The fall in AIDS-related deaths is accompanied by a rise in average life expectancy, which reached just under 64 years in mid-2018, from a recent low of just 54 years in 2005. The improvement moves South Africa closer to the average for upper-middle-income countries, and further gains can be expected during the forecast period. South African demographic statistics, including age profiles, growth rates and life expectancy also display large variations depending on race. The white population-typically wealthier, older and more educated-declined by 0.4% to 4.5m in the year to mid-2018 (7.8% of the total), thereby maintaining a long-term trend, driven by outward migration. By contrast, in the year to mid-2018, the Indian/Asian population grew by 1.5% to 1.4m (2.5% of the total), the coloured/mixed race population by 1.2% to 5.1m (8.8% of the total) and the black population by 1.8% to 46.7m (80.9% of the total). The black share of the total population will continue rising over time.
National Health Insurance advances
Healthcare, which is marked by costly private-sector provision for the rich and second-rate public provision for the poor majority, is on the cusp of a major shake-up, driven by the government's long-running plans for a National Health Insurance (NHI) system. Two bills in mid-2018, one covering the NHI and the other covering the future relationship between public and private provision, push the process forward, but key details are still lacking (and subject to negotiations). Reforms are clearly needed, especially given a steady rise in overall healthcare costs to about 9% of GDP (of which half is accounted for by private operators), but whether the government's plans will have adverse or beneficial outcomes depends on a host of uncertainties. Risks include making private care less affordable, and putting more pressure on overstretched public facilities and the fiscal accounts. The government intends to roll-out the NHI system, in phases, between 2019-25.
Rapid urbanisation will strain social services
South Africa has experienced urbanisation on a large scale (an estimated 65.8% of the population lived in urban centres in 2017), principally in the main metropolitan areas of Gauteng, namely Pretoria and Johannesburg, and the two coastal cities of Cape Town and Durban. Urbanisation will continue throughout the forecast period, lifting the proportion living in cities (and associated slums) to 68.5% by 2022. Urbanisation is boosting market potential but also raises challenges for policymakers, especially with regard to strengthening service delivery at a municipal level, where capacity is typically weaker. Urbanisation is being accompanied by the rapid growth of informal settlements in the vicinity of cities and towns across the country, fuelled by population movements from poorer provinces (such as Limpopo and North West) to richer ones, and migration from neighbouring countries.

South Africa's consumer market will continue transforming, as the poor black majority is increasingly drawn into the mainstream commercial economy, accompanied by an expansion of the black middle-class. The transition is happening less rapidly than previously hoped, given sluggish economic growth and high levels of unemployment (which constrains aggregate demand), although it will gain momentum during the forecast period, helped in part by government initiatives to address poverty and inequality, such as generous welfare payments, land reform and black economic empowerment (BEE) initiatives. Despite significant changes since the apartheid era, South Africa remains one of the world's the most unequal societies-with a Gini co-efficient of 63-largely because of persistent racial disparities. Policy action and faster GDP growth will erode race-based distinctions over time, as signalled by the most recent (albeit outdated) income and expenditure survey published in 2012. The survey showed that spending by black households was growing faster in real terms than spending by white households, even though the absolute gap remained large. Roughly 35% of all households are classified as middle-class, which will increase over the forecast period.
Consumer spending will show a broad upward trend
Household spending growth in real terms retreated from a recent peak of 5.1% in 2011 to just 0.7% in 2016-the weakest since the 2009 recession-because of high levels of household indebtedness, rising interest rates during the period, weak job creation and wages lost to strikes. Demand was also negatively affected by a severe drought in 2016, which squeezed household budgets, leading to a contraction in durable goods purchases. However, private consumption growth rebounded to 2.2% in 2017, a five-year high, helped by favourable rainfall and a first interest rate cut for five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a slight weakening in 2018, despite another rate cut, because of tax rises, although we forecast a steady growth rebound in 2019-22, in line with the wider economy. More generous welfare payments, rising real wages (for those in work), higher levels of financial inclusion and the expansion of the black middle class, will support the improving trend. Consumer spending will also benefit from the expansion of low-cost housing and electrification-which will boost demand for ancillary goods and services-and from the adoption of a more broad-based approach to BEE. The benefits of BEE have been spread narrowly to date, helping to create a new black elite (the so-called black diamonds, who generally display similar consumption patterns to rich whites). However, the drive towards more broad-based BEE, including employee share-ownership schemes and a focus on suppliers, will spread the gains more widely. This will facilitate the expansion of the black middle class, and boost the purchasing power of poorer market segments. The pending introduction of a national minimum wage (in late 2018 or early 2019) will also buoy consumption by lower-income groups, provided the gains are not offset by job losses. "Demonstration effect" purchasing by new middle-class entrants and blue-collar workers-and easier access to and greater reliance on credit-will buoy markets for more expensive retail goods such as electrical appliances. The spread of modern shopping malls will reinforce the trend, as will competition between the leading retailers: Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Woolworths and Massmart, in which Walmart (US) took a majority stake in 2012 for US$2.4bn.

Consumer expenditure will show a broad upward trend over the forecast period, in both rand and US-dollar terms, although the composition of consumption will not change radically. In line with conventional patterns, the proportion spent on foodstuffs will decline over time, although it will remain the largest single category of expenditure, underpinned by the entry of subsistence-level rural dwellers into the commercial economy, the rise in the spending power of lower-income groups (which typically spend more of their money on food) and growing demand by the emergent middle class for higher-value-added food products. The share of total spending accounted for by housing (and household fuels), transport and communications, and leisure and education, will all edge higher in 2018-22.

Total factor productivity growth 1.4 1.9 1.7
Initial conditions: Growth will revive gradually in 2018-22, helped by a rise in confidence after Cyril Ramaphosa's installation as president, accompanied by greater policy clarity and a crackdown on corruption, which will encourage investment. However, global headwinds (including trade wars) and fiscal consolidation in South Africa, alongside lingering policy uncertainty-especially about land reform-mean that growth, despite quickening, will remain sluggish, averaging 2.2% a year in 2018-22. There is little scope for additional monetary loosening (after an interest rate cut in March 2018), especially given the global trend towards tighter monetary conditions. Growth will therefore be too slow to make a significant dent in the high unemployment rate (currently 27.2%), which will continue to dampen aggregate demand. Structural constraints such as labour market rigidity and skills shortages will persist, although electricity supplies will be adequate, helped by private-sector investment in renewable energy.
The impact of HIV/AIDS will gradually dissipate in 2031-50
Demographic trends: South Africa's population will continue to grow at a slow pace, held back by the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which may persist for another generation. However, the downward trend in new infections and deaths attributable to AIDS, and the ongoing rollout of treatment programmes, will reduce the impact of the disease in 2031-50. Life expectancy will consequently rise, although population growth will remain relatively muted, as rising disposable incomes and urbanisation lead to smaller families. The working-age population and the labour force will grow more quickly than the overall population, because of the high proportion of young people, as well as inward migration from other African states, thereby making it harder to bring down the unemployment rate. Another key demographic trend will be the rise in the proportion of urban dwellers, from 65.3% in 2016 to 80% in 2050.
External conditions: South Africa's performance, as a relatively small and open economy that is strongly reliant on mineral exports, will remain closely tied to world trends. This leaves South Africa vulnerable to disruptions stemming from US-led protectionism (under the presidency of Donald Trump), the UK's intention to leave the EU (Brexit) and a Chinese slowdown. Multilateral trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation may fall victim to trade wars, although trade will benefit from bilateral and regional initiatives, including plans for a single African market. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) will continue pressing for freer trade, although ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union may not be realised until after 2030 because of economic and policy divergences between member states. Intra-African trade will continue to be held back by non-tariff barriers and weak infrastructure in 2015-30, but these constraints will ease in 2031-50. Ties with the EU will continue to deepen, following agreement on a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) in 2014. South Africa will retain preferential access to the US market-given the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) until 2025-although its eligibility will be subject to periodic reviews. South Africa's trade and investment ties with non-OECD states, especially fellow BRICS members (Brazil, Russia, India and China) will deepen over the long term, at the expense of traditional links with OECD partners.
The quality of institutions will improve
Institutions and policy trends: The quality of institutions will improve, boosting transparency and accountability, but capacity constraints will persist, especially at provincial and municipal levels. Key institutions, such as the central bank and the judiciary, will retain their independence. The wider policy framework-which is based on a partnership between private business and the "developmental state"-will remain intact. In broad terms, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects moderate, centrist voices to prevail in the policy debate in the longer term, at the expense of pro-patronage forces and the interventionist left. The process will be helped by political realignments that could see the fragmentation of the ruling tripartite alliance-comprising the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party-and the emergence of a new coalition between moderates in the ANC and the opposition. Many current policy challenges will persist into the longer term, including skills shortages, high unemployment and the thorny issue of land reform, although investment will alleviate infrastructure constraints.
Productivity gains will boost growth in the longer term
Long-term performance: We forecast that real GDP growth will average 3.4% a year in 2018-30, helped by rising life expectancy, investment in infrastructure, the expansion of the black middle class, regional integration and global demand for commodities. Technological advances, such as cloud computing and additive printing will also drive growth and boost productivity. Growth will quicken to 4.1% a year in 2031-50, as the ICT revolution gathers momentum, and African integration deepens. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period, owing to a combination of skills shortages and investment in new technology.

Climate change and sustainability
The threat of climate change continues to rise up the national agenda, driven by water deficits, which could worsen as weather patterns become more extreme. A three-season drought in Western Cape, after the failure of winter rains in 2015-17, leading to strict water rationing, highlights the challenge. In response, the government is developing a comprehensive climate change policy, in the form of a draft National Climate Change Bill, unveiled in mid-2018, and is also a signatory to the Paris Agreement (2015), which aims to secure cuts in greenhouse gas emissions on a global basis. A proposed carbon tax in South Africa, in gestation for several years, could play a key role, but the plans are generating controversy, as shown during public hearings on a draft bill in 2018, based on concerns about denting competitiveness without bringing about a significant reduction in emissions. Industry representatives believe that national targets for reducing emissions by 13-14.5% by 2025 will be achieved without a carbon tax, given sustained improvements in energy efficiency. There seems little doubt that a carbon tax will be imposed but the current target date of January 1st 2019 is likely to be pushed forward. The government's newly worked long-term energy plan, running to 2030, although not specifically geared towards climate-related objectives will, nonetheless, have a major impact on emissions because of increased reliance on renewable energy at the expense of coal-fired power. Coal's share of installed generating capacity is expected to fall to 45% in 2030, from 72% in 2018. Major reforms in water policy and management are also required, to stem the risk of the now-ended Western Cape drought becoming a nationwide phenomenon.
Technological developments
South Africa, with the most advanced ICT environment in Africa, is well-placed to benefit from future technological progress. The continent's first cloud-computing data centres, under the Microsoft banner, are on course to open later in 2018 in Johannesburg and Cape Town-the two domestic ICT hubs-while Amazon is similarly investing in cloud computing and advanced data processing. In terms of start-up numbers and financing, South Africa leads the pack in Africa, according to recent figures for 2017 from the GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide. This partly reflects the size of the local economy, but is also underpinned by South Africa's reputable legal system, strong banks and sufficiently stable power supplies. Skills shortages will, nonetheless, remain a challenge although the probable loosening (over time) of restrictions on inward migration for skilled workers may address some of the deficit. Other obstacles are comparatively high end-user tariffs (although these will trend downwards) and the global problem of cybercrime and data security. South Africa's central role in the multi-national Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a powerful radio telescope centred in Northern Cape, will make a significant contribution to technological progress. SKA's first portion, known as MeerKAT, opened in July 2018 to scientific acclaim, and will be followed by new arrays in South Africa, as well as in other African countries and Australia, over the next decade, at a total cost of at least US$2bn. The high-performance data-processing requirements of MeerKAT and SKA will help drive technological development.
Migration and urbanisation
South Africa is a net recipient of cross-border migration, unlike most African countries, driven by inflows from poorer neighbouring states (and sometimes further afield), which will continue into the longer term. The latest mid-year estimates for 2018 show that net inward migration accounted for about 25% of the total population increase (of 888,000) during the preceding 12 months. From another perspective, inward migration was responsible for 0.4 of a percentage point of the overall 1.6% annual increase. This replicates the broad pattern over the past decade, and is unlikely to change radically in future, although the relative contribution of net inward migration will ease over time for two reasons: faster economic growth in other African states than in South Africa; and a rise in South Africa's natural population growth rate as the impact of HIV/AIDS diminishes. South Africa's white population (4.5m in 2018; 7.8% of the total) continues to shrink (by 19,000 in 2018) because of outward migration, leading to a loss of skills, although migrant inflows are far larger and will also make a positive skills contribution, helped, for example, by Zimbabwe having a superior schooling system than South Africa. Inward migration will continue posing social challenges, given South Africa's high unemployment rate, leading to periodic bouts of xenophobia-tinged unrest. Net inward cross-border migration also means that remittance outflows exceed remittance inflows in South Africa, contrary to the usual African pattern. Internal migration within South Africa, mainly from poorer provinces to the economic hubs of Gauteng and Western Cape, is another key driver of population movement and urbanisation. About two-thirds of South Africans are now urban dwellers, a proportion that will continue to rise, although the proliferation of informal settlements and deficits in service provision will remain pressing issues.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Austria--highlights: Political outlook
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full five-year term. The new government will focus on integration and immigration policy, including by taking a prominent role on this issue within the EU. It will attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. The FPÖ's inclusion in government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.

Austria's business environment will improve only slightly in the 2018-22 forecast period, compared with the historical period (2013-17), but stronger improvements elsewhere lead to falls in both our global and regional rankings. The improvement is driven in large part by an improving financing environment following a challenging period for the banking system during the financial crisis. The recent strong economic recovery and related increased market opportunities also contribute to the improvement. The political environment, which is already less stable than in many of Austria's regional peers, will deteriorate further during the forecast period. However, the overall business environment remains strong, owing to high-quality infrastructure, high spending on research and development (R&D) spending, and a relatively well-functioning labour market.

After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.9%, and a moderation to 1.7% on average in 2019-22. We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit-albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP-throughout the 2018-22 forecast period. We expect the current-account surplus to remain broadly stable, at 1.7% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

The population will grow by an annual average of 0.2% over the forecast period, supported chiefly by net migration. As in many other developed countries, the population will age. The share of the total population accounted for by people of working age is expected to decline slightly over the next five years. Immigration from eastern Europe will remain strong. The influx of migrants and refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, which pushed up the population figure in 2015, is not expected to be repeated. The participation of older workers is increasing but remains below the EU average.

Austria is a wealthy country by international standards, with GDP per head well above the regional average. Household consumption growth has been subdued in recent years, and negative labour market trends and high savings rates mean that Austria has not benefited as much as other countries from oil price-related real income gains in recent years. Throughout the forecast period, the outlook for household incomes and consumption is more positive as the labour market recovers. An ageing demographic profile and a rise in the number of single-person households will continue to drive demand for housing, healthcare and leisure services. Income inequalities will remain lower than the regional average.

Real GDP per head is forecast to grow by an annual average of 1.4% in 2018-50. An ageing demographic profile will act as a drag on long-term growth prospects, although Austria has more scope than some other EU countries to raise levels of participation in the labour force, particularly among older workers and women. There is also potential for an improvement in productivity growth, with the government encouraging greater R&D activity and investment in education. Austria's large trade and investment exposure to central and eastern Europe will be a net positive for growth in the long term.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period, Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic, and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: Trade relations are dominated by Germany, which accounts for about one-third of total imports and exports. The current-account surplus is driven by strong tourism exports boosting the services surplus. We expect modest current-account surpluses throughout the forecast period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who subsequently became chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The political scene in the post-war period has been dominated by the ÖVP and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), generally in coalition together. Although the SPÖ's share of the vote was almost unchanged in the election in 2017, several years of strained co-operation meant that it did not go into coalition with the ÖVP again; it is now the main opposition party. The only other parties represented in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) are the liberal NEOS and List Pilz, a breakaway from the Greens, which failed to win a sufficient vote share themselves for the first time since 1986.

Political outlook: Political stability
The governing coalition consists of the ÖVP and the FPÖ. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this coalition to prove relatively stable and to last its full term to 2022. This follows several years of minor progress on reforms, and coalition (as well as party) in-fighting under the grand coalition of the ÖVP and the centre-left SPÖ, which fell apart in May 2017. Mr Kurz took over the leadership of the ÖVP, reformed the party around himself, and moved it closer to the FPÖ on issues such as immigration and integration. As a result, he led the ÖVP to the largest share of the vote in the October 2017 election, winning 31.5% of votes-up by 7.5 percentage points on the party's result in 2013. The SPÖ's share was almost unchanged, at 26.9%. The FPÖ increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS secured its place in parliament, with 5.3% of the vote, but the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time for 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. As Mr Kurz had moved the ÖVP closer to the FPÖ in many policy areas, the negotiations went relatively smoothly. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, over the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
The chancellor is from the ÖVP, but the election was nevertheless a decisive moment in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the latter has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following a breakdown in relations and the reform gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue, and his plans to curtail migration into Austria and Europe more generally.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP and FPÖ programmes, we do not expect the government to implement significant structural reforms, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less aligned than on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into firm policy proposals. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union until the end of 2018. Later in the term, the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The state has a well-established division of power between its legislative, executive and judicial branches, all of which function well by international standards. The extent of interaction between the government and its social partners has varied over the past decade, but we expect this to become increasingly contentious as the fraying of the post-war consensus continues. Government decisions have at times bypassed the social partnership system (Sozialpartnerschaft), which establishes a co-operative relationship with trade unions and employers on aspects of economic policymaking. Membership of the Sozialpartnerschaft is compulsory and its role has been made explicit in law. The social partners are encouraged by government to participate in drafting proposals and bills relating to specific issues. As a consequence, they have been involved in negotiations on issues such as public healthcare reform, opening Austria's labour market to workers from new EU member states and improving education. Previous governments have even tended to delegate decisions on labour policy, such as working hours, directly to the two chambers. The framework has tended to work to the advantage of the traditional mainstream parties; its influence decreased when the FPÖ was in government in 2000-05. With the FPÖ again in government from 2017, we expect further pressure on this system, with the party likely to attempt to increase its own influence in many of the social partners' groups, in which it tends to be significantly underrepresented compared with the ÖVP and the SPÖ. Furthermore, the new government showed its willingness to work around this system as it bypassed the social partners when it relaxed rules on working hours in 2018.
Austria's nine federal states (Länder) each have an elected legislature, a state government and a governor, but have fewer direct powers than states in some other federal countries, including Germany. A high proportion of tax revenue is collected at the federal level, although there is some pressure to increase fiscal federalism. Although spending is more decentralised, decision-making is largely concentrated at the federal level, with subnational governments mainly tasked with the administration and implementation of programmes. The principle of finanzausgleich (fiscal equalisation) regulates the distribution of revenue at the federal level between the states. Co-ordination between the different layers of government is strong but also complex, and the lack of accountability and transparency contributes to inefficiencies in the fiscal framework and a high level of bureaucracy. The new government aims to centralise policymaking further, including in areas such as social security and childcare provision, but will face strong opposition from within the ÖVP as the regional governors and the social partners seek to defend their own interests and influence.
Political outlook: Election watch
The most recent general election was held on October 15th 2017. We expect the government to remain in office until the end of its term, which ends in late 2022, maintaining its majority in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament). There is a risk of an early election, although we believe that the probability of a snap vote is small. The next election for the largely ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Political outlook: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow-and thus often against other EU member states-will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will take a pro-EU stance, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The government wants Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc, especially on migration reform, which its role (until end-2018) as president of the Council of the European Union should facilitate. We expect the government to move forward with proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ into government, in 2000, led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations, the reception has been more muted this time. In that period, a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands. However, this will at times lead to tensions with fellow EU members, as shown by the fact that a number of countries are now sharing less intelligence with Austria because the ministries concerned are headed by the FPÖ.

Austria's score in the Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings improves marginally between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). However, Austria loses ground in the global and regional rankings, owing to more pronounced improvements in other countries. Austria falls from the 15th most attractive market globally in the historical period to 18th in the forecast period. Compared with its regional peers, Austria also suffers a three-place slide, from ninth to 12th. Nevertheless, Austria's business environment remains attractive, despite its relative decline, as illustrated by the improvement in its (already high) overall score. The uptick in our forecast rests on our expectation of a continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment; this should support better financing conditions and market opportunities. The main drag on Austria's score for 2018-22 comes from the political environment in the wake of the 2017 election and also from recent geopolitical developments, with both political stability and effectiveness likely to be negatively affected. Moreover, Austria's scores in a number of categories in our business environment index have remained broadly unchanged, reflecting the slow progress of reform in recent years.
Overall, the Austrian business environment is comparatively attractive. Its main strengths are its stable political environment, highly skilled labour force and high degree of openness to international trade. Although political stability is underpinned by a mature democratic system, the effectiveness of government continues to be hampered by the patronage system in place, which is part of Austria's post-war democratic tradition.

Business environment outlook: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform cuts red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Possible increase in state involvement in the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal. Risk of disruption, owing to trade dispute between the EU and the US, and possibly a disorderly Brexit.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe. Lending growth remains strong.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market continues to improve as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns over shortages of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Work continues on transport network, including on tunnel connection to Italy.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below several regional peers, but research and development remains relatively strong.
2020-22: Further progress made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

The macroeconomic environment is improving
Austria's macroeconomic environment has improved markedly following a strong 2017 growth outturn, the momentum of which has so far carried over into 2018. However, this follows several years of only tepid expansion. The recent upturn has led to a revival in manufacturing output that has fuelled a decline in unemployment and now also an uptick in wage growth. The environment should remain favourable during the forecast period, owing to solid public finances, falling unemployment, a competitive exporting base and supportive financing terms. There will be some challenges, however. Austrian manufacturers are dealing with capacity constraints that will keep a lid on growth as long as they remain unaddressed, although capital investment has increased recently.
Risks to the outlook stem from Austria's openness to-and dependence on-international trade. A slowdown in European and international demand, compounded by the risk of an increase in protectionist sentiment, would affect Austrian growth prospects. Uncertainty over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and beyond could weigh on business confidence.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition is liberal and should remain so over the forecast period. Austria's good standing in the rankings is underpinned by high levels of protection for private and intellectual property, relatively benign government regulations and high freedom to compete, low levels of state control, and good protection of minority shareholder rights. However, Austria scores poorly with regard to its overall competition policy framework and influence of lobbying activity. Austria's stagnation on the competition front was reflected in the World Bank's Doing Business rankings, in which its overall score has lost some ground in recent years, although the country is still ranked highly. Businesses find it easy to trade across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency, although procedures to start a new business are suboptimal and rank poorly. Meanwhile, policy is still restrictive in the services industry: according to the OECD's Services Trade Restrictiveness Index, Austria has a more restrictive policy than the OECD average in 11 of 21 sectors covered by the index. Although some improvements to the competition framework have been made in recent years, such as a reduction in the amount of capital needed to form a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH; a company with limited liability), from EUR35,000 to EUR5,000 for the first ten years of its existence, which is more in line with the requirements in other EU countries, we do not expect any significant improvements over the forecast horizon.
The competition framework could be strengthened
Despite improvements to the competition framework in recent years, there is still scope to strengthen the enforcement powers of the independent Federal Competition Authority (BWB), which is one of the smallest in the EU. Some measures are planned that could boost its effectiveness. The new government has planned to merge the BWB with the Federal Cartel Prosecutor, a measure that has long been advocated as a way to improve effectiveness. There has also been an uptick in public funding in recent years. Positively, the third EU energy liberalisation programme, implemented in 2009, should gradually lead to greater price transparency and higher customer mobility in the electricity and gas sectors. As part of these reforms, Austria is working to improve internal market mechanisms by unbundling transmission system operators from generation, production and supply.
Risk of greater interference in private enterprise
The risk of political interference in private enterprise remains relatively high. On April 1st 2015 a new entity, Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen (ÖBIB), assumed responsibility for managing the Austrian state's holdings in several private companies, such as Telekom Austria and OMV, an oil producer. The changes allow for greater government involvement in the management of the firms. Moreover, the political composition of the nomination committee creates the potential for the selection of board members to become the subject of intra-coalition wrangling.
The retail sector has long been subject to heavy regulation, restricting the number and type of outlets, and hours of business. Although over the years there has been a significant liberalisation of shop opening hours, further liberalisation has faced opposition from a strong alliance between the trade unions and the Catholic Church, which wants to prevent shops from opening on Sundays and Catholic holidays. The conservative nature of the new government means that little progress in further liberalisation is likely.
Few privatisations of state-owned companies have taken place in recent years. Public opinion is generally sceptical towards privatisation. The new government has said that it is open to state ownership of strategic companies should the need arise. However, this is unlikely to have any significant impact in coming years in terms of the state's share in the economy.

Austria has a generally open and welcoming stance towards foreign direct investment (FDI), and we expect this to continue over the forecast period. Austria's score is underpinned by strong investor protection and very low expropriation risk, although it scores only adequately on the "openness of national culture" metric. Overall, there are no sectoral or geographical limitations on FDI flows, although there are tough environmental regulations that need to be accounted for. There are few specific restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and property, and regulations do not tend to discriminate between domestic and foreign-owned companies. The Austrian Business Agency (ABA) is the government body responsible for FDI relations and provides advisory services to prospective investors. However, in recent years there has been increasingly vocal discontent when "national champions" have been taken over. In 2013 a law was passed requiring ministerial approval when non-EU foreign investors wish to take a 25% or greater stake in a firm operating in a sector deemed of national interest.
We expect Austria to maintain its close economic ties with central and east European countries; opportunities in west European economies are limited, owing to saturated markets. Austria will also retain its attractive position as a link between western, central and eastern Europe, which will continue to offer investment opportunities. Many Austrian firms distribute to central and east European countries at the wholesale level (although there remains significant room for improvement on transport links to the region). Many Austrian banks continue to operate significant networks in central and eastern Europe-despite some retrenchment since the global financial crisis-and so can offer access to trade and investment financing for companies that want to do business there. However, exposure to central and eastern Europe entails risks, highlighted by ongoing concerns about political and security risks in Ukraine and tensions between the EU and Russia. Austria is among those countries with most to lose from a long-term decline in political relations with Russia, for example via finance, tourism, investment and construction channels.
The new government has vowed to increase Austria's attractiveness to foreign investors. Planned measures to support this aim are boosting funding to the ABA to allow it to pursue potential investors more aggressively and stepping up so-called national branding on the model of the UK's "GREAT" campaign.
Some ambivalence exists towards international trade agreements
However, there are some clouds on the horizon that will limit Austria's progress in becoming a more attractive investment destination. The new conservative government has voiced its scepticism about some of the comprehensive free-trade agreements (FTAs) being negotiated by the European Commission. Although the new government ratified the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada in June 2018, it has stated that it wants greater transparency and safeguards in future FTAs, which could hamper progress towards freer-flowing capital.
In mid-2018 the European Commission approved draft rules on establishing a regional framework for screening FDI into the EU on grounds of national security. Some member states have criticised the plans as protectionist in nature, although the Commission argues that similar initiatives exist in major trading partners such as China and the US.

Austria's foreign trade and exchange regimes are defined by its memberships of the EU and the euro zone. Goods, services, capital and people can move freely across borders within the EU, of which most countries bordering Austria are members, and we do not expect this to change over the medium term. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU, and we do not expect any exchange controls. The EU trades with Norway and Iceland under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and has a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland and a customs union with Turkey. Only agriculture is excluded from these arrangements. Bureaucratic barriers to foreign trade are low in Austria. The World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report ranks the country as a global leader in terms of the ease of crossborder trading, with the costs involved and time taken to export and import goods well below the average for high-income OECD countries.
Little further progress on global trade liberalisation expected
Trade between EU member states and third countries has been largely governed by multilateral agreements administered by the World Trade Organisation. There has been minimal progress in global trade talks over the past decade. A general increase in protectionist sentiment, notably in the US, means that little progress will be made in multilateral trade talks over the forecast period. The EU's focus will thus be on bilateral deals, and we expect further gradual progress in this area. The backdrop will be challenging, however, given the rise in protectionist measures implemented by governments around the world. These actions are likely to inhibit global trade flows, and there is a notable risk that an escalating chain reaction of measures will occur, threatening a dramatic fraying of the multilateral trade system.
The EU-Canada agreement, CETA, will gradually come into force. CETA, which the Austrian government ratified in June 2018, will eliminate most trade tariffs, ease border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation. In December 2017 the EU finalised an economic partnership agreement with Japan that will create the world's largest free-trade area. The deal will come into effect from early 2019, although there will be a lengthy transition phase for most measures over the next decade. In April 2018 the EU and Mexico agreed in principle to a trade deal that would include a significant reduction of tariffs.

Austria's score on taxation deteriorates marginally between the historical and forecast periods, but both its global and regional rankings fall significantly. Austria benefits from a relatively low corporate tax rate of 25% and a comparatively fair tax system. However, the tax system is held back by its complexity and high labour income tax rates, with a progressive system consisting of seven brackets, rising from 0% to 55%. Austria ranks around average in the EU for value-added tax (VAT), with a headline rate of 20%. The corporate tax rate has been at 25% since 2005, broadly in line with most regional peers. Overall, the tax/GDP ratio (which also includes social security contributions) was 42.9% in 2016 (latest available data), above the EU average of 40%. In terms of tax structure, the share of tax receipts from VAT, personal and corporate income, property and indirect taxation is in each case roughly on a par with the EU averages, whereas the share of revenue from social security contributions is considerably higher. Austria had the fifth-highest tax wedge among the 35 OECD members, suggesting that the 2015 tax reform that came into effect in January 2016 and cut a number of taxes had little overall impact.
The new government has made comprehensive tax reform one of its main goals and is aiming to lower the tax/GDP ratio to 40%. It plans greatly to simplify the tax system for households and companies and allow the latter to reduce their tax base. Through these measures, it also hopes to lower the effective tax rate for corporates and households. A number of tax relief measures for poorer households have already been included in the budget passed earlier this year. However, there is some doubt as to whether the government will be able to deliver on its promise, given the contentious nature of the reforms and their large scale. Furthermore, although the budget deficit has narrowed in recent years, fiscal space remains limited and the government is likely to struggle to find sufficient spending cuts to fully offset the decrease in taxes.

A stronger banking sector will support credit growth
Austrian credit conditions are expected to improve dramatically over the forecast period, helping the country to rise by several places in the rankings. The improvement is predicated on our expectation that the banking sector and the stockmarket will become more dynamic and that financial distortions will be low to non-existent. Moreover, improvements in the regulatory framework, and to foreign access to finance and greater access to investment finance, should provide support for the uptick in financing conditions. The Austrian economy, like much of the euro area, is highly dependent on the banking sector to finance itself, although capital markets as a source of long-term credit are gaining traction. Austrian banks are on a healthier footing, as shown by their improved capital ratios, which are now well above the legal minimum for the sector. They are also relatively unencumbered by non-performing loans (which made up just 2.3% of total loans in early 2018). The banking sector's exposure in central, east and south-east Europe (CESEE) remains significant, having caused large write-downs in the wake of the global financial crisis. Positively, the CESEE region's macro-financial conditions and economic dynamics have improved significantly. The asset quality of the banking sectors in CESEE have strengthened markedly, reducing risks to the Austrian banking system.
Financial-sector supervision lies with the Financial Market Authority (FMA), the Austrian Nationalbank (the country's central bank) and the European Central Bank. To rein in banking sector risk, in 2011 the central bank announced new capital rules and lending curbs for banks. Banks are required to adhere to tighter capital requirements, to take account of the full implementation of Basel III rules from 2013. The FMA introduced a systemic risk buffer of up to 2% of risk-weighted assets, to be phased in over 2016-19, following earlier macroprudential measures that focus on stronger local funding of Austrian banks' subsidiaries abroad and fewer foreign-currency loans. Banks are subject to a loan/deposit ratio ceiling of 110% for lending in CESEE, and are required to write "living wills" to prepare for potential crises.
Bank profitability should continue to improve over the forecast period. The highly fragmented Austrian banking sector, which is very localised, carries high costs. Additional regulatory burdens placed on the sector in recent years have added to the financial burdens on many small banks, which have been compounded by the low interest-rate environment. Nevertheless, banks have improved their efficiency and also undergone some consolidation to bring costs down. This will support further lending growth in the coming years, after lending to the non-financial corporate sector began to increase in early 2017. The unwinding of the three "bad banks" that were set up in the wake of the financial crisis to clean up banks' balance sheets will continue apace.
Risks to the banking sector remain, owing to its exposure to the CESEE region and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of sanctions on Russia and their likely continuation. The economic outlook in the region is sensitive to swings in Russia's economic fortunes. However, risks relating to foreign-currency loans have receded, and should continue to do so, following the introduction of regulatory measures in recent years to restrict these kinds of loans.

The labour market has turned a corner after years of rising unemployment
The Austrian labour market should remain attractive and operate well over the forecast period. The labour force is well qualified and healthy, with good foreign language skills. Moreover, labour productivity is high-on a par with that in Germany. The labour market itself is underpinned by a significant degree of flexibility compared with other developed economies, with few restrictions on hiring and firing. Labour costs are high, however. There is a high degree of industrial harmony between unions and employers, underpinned by the consensual system of social partnership. However, the labour market is under increasing pressure from labour shortages, owing to the strong economic upswing, which has driven down unemployment. An increasing number of manufacturers are reporting difficulties finding qualified labour and have had to turn down contracts as a result. Like neighbouring Germany, Austria has to contend with an ageing workforce. It also suffers from low labour market participation from women, migrants and older workers.
The government has made addressing the labour shortage one of its priorities. It plans to bolster the apprenticeship framework by providing financial incentives to firms through the tax system. However, it is unlikely that the impact of these measures will be felt to any significant degree over the forecast period, given the longer time horizon labour market reforms usually require.
Owing to a lack of prioritisation by the new government, little progress is to be expected in relation to increasing the labour participation rate of women and migrants. This is likely to lead to further stress in the labour market in the short to medium term. There are plans to facilitate the recognition of foreign qualifications to allow migrants into work more easily. However, the government's heightened political hostility towards migration, reflected in its decision to cut a number of labour market programmes that are aimed at the long-term unemployed and at integrating migrants into the labour market, will make their integration harder. Furthermore, such measures risk putting off potentially highly skilled immigrants from moving to Austria.
Labour market flexibility to be increased
Plans have been announced to introduce more flexibility into the labour market. Working hours are the primary channel through which the government hopes to achieve this. Firm-level wage agreements will increasingly be applied, as opposed to branch-level ones. This risks heavy opposition from unions, which could negate the positive impact of the reforms in the short term by spoiling Austria's strong labour relations.

Austria has high-quality infrastructure and ranks well globally and regionally. Its infrastructure is well distributed across the territory, boasts excellent road and rail density, as well as good waterway and air connections. An extensive transport network provides good access to west European industrial centres. However, links to its southern and eastern neighbours suffer from underinvestment. This latter point is particularly important in view of the continuing rise in transit traffic (both east-west and north-south) through Austria, which is creating bottlenecks and raising environmental concerns about vehicle emissions. The country also benefits from excellent healthcare, telecommunications and energy infrastructure. Mobile telecoms prices have fallen in recent years, owing to increased competition, prompted by the entry of several new providers to the market.
The government does not plan to develop a large-scale infrastructure programme over the forecast period. It will focus instead on improving the efficiency of public investment in transport infrastructure. It will scale back some of the previous government's more ambitious infrastructure investments, in part because of the high indebtedness of the national railway company, ÖBB. Nevertheless, work will continue on three new tunnels, which should be completed by 2026 at the latest. This includes the Brenner Base Tunnel, a 55-km rail tunnel to Italy under the Brenner Pass, co-financed with Italy and the EU.

This category, introduced in 2018, aims to show the extent to which the business environment is open to innovation, digitally connected and prepared for technological disruption. Although Austria's technological readiness ranks well in global and regional comparisons, its score drops slightly in the forecast period. The country has a high-quality e-commerce environment, well-developed e-government services, excellent research infrastructure and high levels of research and development (R&D) spending. It also ranks well in cybersecurity preparedness, and in terms of its number of mobile-phone and internet users. R&D intensity was 3.1% of GDP in 2016, which placed it behind only Sweden in the EU. The government is seeking to increase private-sector involvement in R&D spending. It increased the research tax premium by 2 percentage points to 14% to attract private investment into research. However, there are still too few links between Austria's research community and business, which makes it difficult to develop innovations commercially and bring them to market. Moreover, the country's digital infrastructure lags behind regional peers, primarily because of the deep "rural divide" in broadband coverage: only 45% of rural households have access to high-speed internet, compared with a national average of 90%.
The government aims to increase the links between research and business. It also plans to develop tools to attract foreign private investment in R&D. However, few firm proposals have so far emerged, suggesting that the effectiveness of government policy in matters of technological readiness will be limited over the forecast period.
There are more tangible proposals regarding the physical infrastructure underpinning the government's digital strategy. It plans on rolling out 1Gb internet connections throughout the whole country and to develop a fifth-generation (5G) network by 2025. Government services will be further digitalised, as will schools. Law and regulation changes are also planned to accommodate the changing nature of government and business.
The government is looking to upgrade the large manufacturing base
In line with its counterparts in a number of other European economies, the government set up an Industrie 4.0 initiative in 2014 to bring together parties involved in new manufacturing techniques. The relatively large share of manufacturing in the economy, with companies often deeply connected to the large German manufacturing sector, will ensure that the government will continue to focus its attention here and less on, for instance, fostering an internet start-up environment.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The new government plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits that are sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexible working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes that are aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. Although it has announced a push to centralise and streamline the welfare system-to which several major stakeholders, including state governors, are likely to object-it does not plan to reform the so-called Proporz system, under which the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) had apportioned public entities and functions (state companies, public services, subsidies and regulatory responsibilities). This is despite suggestions from both coalition parties-especially the Freedom Party (FPÖ)-in the past that they would want to do this. The Economist Intelligence Unit therefore believes that reforms will remain limited to small-scale efforts in only a few areas, such as the labour market, and expects the government to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government revenue 48.2 47.9 47.6 47.5 47.3 47.2
Budget balance -0.7 -0.3 -0.3 -0.2 -0.4 -0.5
Government debt 78.2 74.7 72.2 70.0 68.3 66.9
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery following the financial and euro zone crises and a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts have remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. Strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to 0.7% in 2017.
The government plans to achieve a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending, and reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge at the same time. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures, including cutting spending on asylum-seekers. We therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be attained in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit; we expect it to average around 0.3% of GDP in the 2018-22 forecast period.
The public debt stock is projected to decline gradually, from 78.2% of GDP in 2017 to just below 67% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain in a worse state than in countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low, in our view.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September. This will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in parts of the zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25% in early 2020, and five more rises that will lift the rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.

Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but the economy subsequently stalled and underperformed compared with regional peers-notably Germany. This was particularly striking, given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers, and weakened productivity growth-admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and in early 2017. We expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.9% this year. Export and investment rates have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above the level in Germany for the first time since 2005, and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-after an underperformance compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year. However, we forecast slightly slower real GDP growth, of 2.9%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector to be less pronounced in 2018. Nevertheless, increasing labour shortages will contribute to business investment pushing up investment growth in the first half of our five-year forecast period. Fuelled by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. In 2019-22 we expect a further moderation of growth, to 1.7% on average-close to the economy's potential growth rate. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments, including the negative economic impact of a potential disorderly Brexit, which is not our core forecast. If the trade dispute between the EU and the US were to escalate further (which is not our core projection, especially after the EU and the US announced their intention in late July to strike a limited trade deal), there is potential for much larger disruption.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Although it has shrunk in size, industry still accounts for around 28% of Austria's GDP and remains an important driver of economic growth, owing to the large manufacturing sector, which is highly integrated in regional supply chains. After a steep contraction in 2009, the industrial sector bounced back fairly strongly as global trade volumes picked up, growing by an average of 3.2% per year in real terms in 2010-12. However, Austrian industry could not escape the subsequent downturn in euro zone growth. Industrial growth averaged just 0.7% in 2013-16. The weaker performance of recent years has brought into focus a decline in competitiveness compared with some of the country's euro zone peers, and Austrian exports have lost market share. However, industrial growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 6.5%, as the Austrian economy benefited from a synchronised global upswing and an especially strong year in its main European export markets. We forecast another year of strong industrial growth in 2018, in part reflecting catch-up after the weak post-crisis years, at 4.6%, followed by a moderation to average growth of 1.2% in 2019-22.
Tourism and finance continue to dominate the services sector
Services dominate the Austrian economy, accounting for over 70% of GDP. Two of Austria's most prominent services sectors are financial services and tourism. Austrian banks' early moves to establish a strong position in central and eastern Europe initially gave them a strategic advantage over other European competitors, although in the post-crisis years many of these investments caused problems. These have now largely passed and the sector is looking increasingly healthy and able to contribute to growth in the coming years.
Austria's tourism sector is highly developed and large by international standards. Tourism receipts were equivalent to 5% of GDP in 2016, according to the World Tourism Organisation, compared with only 1.2% in Germany and 1.9% in France. Tourism has held up well in recent years, despite the euro zone crisis. The weakness of the Russian economy and the rouble have led to a decline in the number of Russian visitors (who are often among the higher-spending tourists), but overall we expect the Austrian tourism sector to remain strong during the forecast period, partly because destinations such as Turkey and Egypt have become less attractive for European tourists. The government has made efforts to develop the tourism industry and has sought to diversify away from its traditional heavy reliance on Alpine holidays. One area of growth in recent years has been "wellness tourism", with Austria's clean air, attractive environment and top-class facilities promoted strongly as a favoured destination for health-related holidays. We expect growth in the services sector to continue closely tracking headline GDP growth, at 2% on average in 2018-22.
Agriculture will remain small as a percentage of GDP, but-unlike in some parts of western Europe-it is not expected to contract in the forecast period. However, stronger growth in other sectors will see its share of GDP fall from 1.3% on average in 2013-17 to 1.2% in 2018 and slightly further in the coming years. We expect the sector to grow by an annual average of only 1% in 2018-22.

Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised rate) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. It averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects caused a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. We expect full-year average inflation of 2% in 2018, driven largely by the uptick in global oil prices in the first half of 2018. A strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2019-22, at 2% on average, as structural factors seen in previous years persist.

In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the start of February 2018, but weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and weakened further to US$1.13:EUR1 in mid-August. The euro will remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and from monetary tightening in the US, but we expect it to begin to strengthen against the US dollar from 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average rate of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2018-19 and US$1.21:EUR1 in 2020-21. The euro will also receive structural support from a large regional current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.

Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand (compressing import values) helped to push the trade balance into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. Rising oil prices in 2017 pushed it back into a modest deficit, however, and we expect gradually widening trade deficits during 2018-22. However, the current account should remain in positive territory, largely owing to solid surpluses on the services balance, driven chiefly by robust tourist inflows This will ensure healthy current-account surpluses in 2018-22, averaging 1.7% of GDP.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Austria
Stocks and flows
Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have risen steadily since Austria joined the EU. Although it remains one of the smaller hosts in western Europe in absolute terms, it has made substantial progress relative to the size of its economy. The stock of FDI increased significantly from the equivalent of 6.6% of GDP in 1994 (the year before Austria joined the EU) to 70.3% in 2017. FDI inflows posted a record of US$81.3bn in 2005, but have since dropped significantly, to US$800m on average in 2011-17. FDI outflows followed a similar pattern: after peaking at US$81.5bn in 2005 they stood at US$14.3bn (divestment) in 2010, before averaging US$7.3bn in 2011-17. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the stock of Austrian FDI abroad to rise gradually in the coming years, from US$339.7bn in 2017 to US$401.7bn at the end of the forecast period in 2022, and the stock of FDI in Austria is expected to rise gradually from US$294.1bn over the same timeframe.
Origin and distribution
Companies in other EU member states have traditionally been the largest inward direct investors, accounting for over half of the inward FDI stock in 2017. Historically, most FDI comes from the EU15, in particular Germany, and Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have also been important sources of inflows. In terms of stock, Germany remains comfortably the biggest holder, with EUR44.5bn in 2017 (28.7% of the total), followed by Russia (EUR27bn; 17.4%) and the US (EUR11.6bn; 7.5%). Central and south-eastern Europe remains an important destination for Austrian FDI outflows, although the stock of outward investment in this region has remained relatively steady in recent years, as companies have been repatriating capital. The region now represents around 31% of the total stock of Austrian outward FDI, compared with 50% in 2008. Professional scientific and technical services activities, financial intermediation and trade were the sectors in Austria with the greatest foreign investment in 2017. The same was true for Austrian investors abroad, although financial intermediation was by some margin the largest sector for outward foreign investment, largely because of Austrian banks' deep involvement in central and south-eastern Europe.
Determinants
Austria's main strengths as a location for FDI are its central location within the EU's single market, its proximity to and historical ties with eastern Europe, its competitive corporation tax rate (25%), an educated and flexible workforce, an excellent labour relations record, advanced information technology (IT) and telecommunications infrastructure, a growing emphasis on research and development (R&D), and a high quality of life. However, negative aspects for Austria are its high level of employers' social security contributions, its significant levels of red tape, and delays in expanding road and rail infrastructure towards eastern Europe. Outward direct investment has been driven in large part by integration with other euro zone economies, particularly Germany, and by the opportunities provided by the opening up of eastern neighbours' economies, although growth in investment into the former has been stronger in recent years.
Impact
FDI has increased competitiveness by providing a boost to fixed capital formation and assisting in the diffusion of new technologies and best practices developed in multinational companies. Outward investment, particularly in the financial sector, has helped to promote growth in the banking sector and has diversified risks away from the euro zone, although there have been other problems associated with economies in central and eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Ukraine and Russia. Public opinion remains ambivalent towards inward investment, with some opposition persisting in relation to the sale of "national champions"-notably in the manufacturing and energy sectors-to foreign investors. The introduction at EU level of new measures to screen foreign investment from outside the bloc could further limit the impact of FDI.
Potential
Austria's strong links with Germany and central and eastern Europe have historically been viewed as a strength. During the 2008-09 economic crisis, these links were temporarily deemed a weakness, but as the German economy has become the main driver of economic growth in Europe in recent years, Austrian firms have benefited. Despite exposure to central and eastern Europe having been less beneficial in the wake of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, over the longer term growth in much of the region is expected comfortably to outpace that of western Europe. Austrian companies' early move into the region has given them the advantage of establishing themselves there as large and respected organisations, and they are expected to benefit from this during the forecast period. Austria is well placed to remain an attractive bridge to central and eastern Europe. The government will continue to seek to attract companies to establish their regional headquarters in Austria, and the country's favourable corporate tax environment and advantages in terms of quality of life serve as a magnet to high-tech companies in the IT sector. However, a lack of competition in some services markets and the need to expand transport links to Austria's eastern neighbours will remain challenges during the forecast period.

Austria's population was estimated at 8.8m in 2017 by Statistics Austria, an increase of around 500,000, or 6%, over the past decade. The data does not match that used in The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, which come from the UN for comparability reasons and tend to lag the official data. We expect further population growth in the coming years, although this will be less pronounced than over the previous decade. Natural change (more births than deaths) has been a contributor to population growth since the mid-1980s, but the main driver in recent years has been migration. According to Statistics Austria, annual net immigration increased from 3,880 people in 1996 to a record 113,067 in 2015. This largely because of the sizeable intake of refugees in the second half of that year. As this movement came to a halt in the first half of 2016, the figure for 2016 was more in line with the years before 2015, at 64,676, and it fell further, to 44,630, in 2017. We expect this source of population growth to be less pronounced in the coming years.
The share of foreign nationals in the population is relatively high
The share of registered foreign nationals in the total population is one of the highest in Europe, at just above 13% at the start of 2017, up from 7.4% in 2001. On a national measure, which includes people with at least one parent born abroad, the percentage of the population with a migration background was 22.8% in 2017. The high proportion of foreign nationals is in part related to the naturalisation process taking longer than in many other EU countries, although the number of people granted citizenship has been increasing fairly rapidly since 2011. Around two-thirds of foreign nationals are from non-EU countries, with the majority from the former Yugoslavia and Turkey. Measures limiting access to the Austrian labour market for citizens from the ten EU member states that joined in 2004 were removed in April 2011. Restrictions on immigration from Romania and Bulgaria were removed in 2014. The inflow of refugees in 2015-16 led to an increase in people from Syria and Afghanistan, although these two groups together are still slightly outnumbered by people from Romania. The government has suggested European-wide measures to limit migration but implementation of measures to restrict migration from outside the EU has proved difficult and there is little political appetite to curb intra-EU migration. We therefore expect inward migration to continue in the forecast period, mostly from newer member states and non-EU member states in the region.
Austria's population will age as it continues to grow slowly
As elsewhere in the developed world, the population will age owing to a low, albeit slightly increasing, fertility rate (at 1.52 children born per woman in 2017, compared with 1.39 in 2007). Nevertheless, we expect the population to grow by 0.2% in 2018-22, a slightly slower growth rate than in 2013-17. The ageing population is reflected in our forecast for average life expectancy, which is projected to rise from 81 years in 2013-17 to 81.9 years in 2018-22. The number of people aged under 15 is forecast to remain almost unchanged relative to the total population between 2017 and 2022, at just over 14%. Over the same period, however, the proportion of the population aged 65 or over will rise from 19.2% to 20.5% of the total. Highlighting the demographic challenge for the economy, the size of the working-age population will broadly stagnate.
Focus is on boosting labour force participation among older workers
Faced with a declining pool of young, skilled employees, policymakers have acknowledged the need to boost employment among older workers. Reforms of the state-run pension system are an example of this shift in policy: one of the key aims is to reverse the long-standing trend towards early retirement. The effective retirement age is still three years below the statutory level, particularly for men. Currently, retirement is possible from the age of 62 for men and from 60 for women (subject to 40 years of contributions or credits). However, the legal retirement age for women will be gradually brought into line with that for men between 2024 and 2033. Additional measures have been introduced to improve labour market opportunities for older workers (where employment levels at present are below the EU average), including employer incentives to retain and hire older employees, increased funding for retraining schemes and efforts by the Public Employment Service Austria to promote the employability of older workers. As a consequence, the participation rate of those aged 60 to 64 years doubled between 2006 and 2017, to 28.2%. However, in recent years the participation rate of those aged 65 to 69 has stagnated and the participation of workers above 50 years old remains below the EU average.

Austria is a wealthy country by international standards. GDP per head measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis was US$53,724 in 2017, well above the EU average. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Austria's relative position to remain broadly unchanged over the forecast period (2018-22), owing to a pick-up in real GDP growth compared with the previous five years, at 1.9% on average in 2018-22, against 1.8% on average for the EU as a whole. As a result, at US$62,803 in 2022, its GDP per head on a PPP basis means that it will remain one of the continent's (and, by extension, the world's) wealthiest countries.
Consumption growth will accelerate but remain modest
Private consumption growth was weaker than the EU average in recent years but, in line with the recovery across the bloc, accelerated from 2016, when it grew by 1.6%. We expect this upturn to last until 2019, with average growth of 1.7% in 2018-19, after which we expect it to moderate again. Consumption growth will be supported by the improving labour market, which will help to push up incomes, and tax cuts announced by the new government will support after-tax incomes in the coming years. Nevertheless, Austria's traditionally high saving rate, at around 8% in recent years according to the OECD (in line with a number of its regional peers), will mean that the feedthrough of income growth into consumption will remain smaller than in some other markets.
Austria is among the most advanced countries in the world in terms of its telecommunications and internet infrastructure. Total spending on information technology (IT) should grow more by than overall demand over the forecast period, reflecting the increased take-up of internet telephony, broadband and wireless services. The slight acceleration of economic growth and incomes will help to support demand for the latest innovative products, aspects in which Austria has at times slightly lagged some of its regional peers.
Austria's score in the market opportunities category of our business environment rankings remains relatively low in the forecast period, at 6.3 out of 10 (up from 6.1 in 2013-17). This mainly reflects the small size of the market and the relatively weak real GDP and trade growth that characterises a developed market. As a result, even its regional performance is relatively weak, and the country remains only tenth in our regional ranking.

Population ageing will have an impact on spending patterns
Austria is a mature consumer market, but demographic trends will have a large influence on spending patterns over the forecast period. With a high (and rising) life expectancy and a declining fertility rate, Austria's population is ageing. Although the total population is set to grow over the next decade and beyond, the proportion of those between 15 and 64 will drop slightly, and the proportion over the age of 65 will rise. Austria's changing demographic profile, allied to sociological trends (such as the increase in single-person households), will continue to drive demand for housing, transport, communications, healthcare and leisure services. In general, income inequalities across Austria are lower than the west European average, which helps to support private consumption.
In line with other advanced economies, an increasing share of spending is moving online. E-commerce will be a key driver of turnover growth in the coming years as retailers continue to develop their online presence. Nevertheless, the Austrian consumer market tends to be slightly slower than most of its regional peers in its pick-up of new technologies and it lags slightly in the development of the e-commerce environment. As a consequence, there is slightly more opportunity in this area in Austria than in most other western European economies.

Initial conditions: Austria is a wealthy country. Compared with some other high-income countries, it saw relatively good productivity growth in the period up to 2008, owing to reforms enacted at the beginning of the 2000s. These reforms helped to strengthen the long-term sustainability of the state pension system, lower the tax burden and improve the competitiveness of Austrian companies. However, progress on reform has stalled in recent years, and trends in productivity have been broadly negative since 2010. A number of areas still require attention if Austria is to raise its long-term growth potential. These include increasing product and labour market flexibility, boosting labour force participation rates, raising education standards, reducing high drop-out rates in tertiary education, lowering the tax on labour and continued reform of the banking sector. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit's core forecast assumes some progress in many of these areas, we nevertheless expect slightly slower total factor productivity in Austria than in a number of its regional peers, including Germany.
Migration will not compensate for negative demographic trends
Demographic trends: The total population should grow slightly, by an average of below 0.1% per year, in 2018-50, owing to immigration and higher life expectancy. However, as in other European economies, the population will age over the long-term forecast period. As a result, the working-age population will decline by an average of almost 0.5% per year in 2018-50, and so the share of the working-age population in the total population will decline from 66.7% in 2017 to around 56% by 2050, significantly increasing the old-age dependency ratio. To avoid a sizeable contraction in the workforce, Austria must raise its labour force participation rate, especially of older workers. To some extent, this is being addressed by pension reforms that came into force at the beginning of 2014. Increased net migration is also a (short-term) option, but the hostile political climate toward immigration will limit the scope for this.
External conditions: Austria stands to benefit from the faster expected growth rates of the EU's newer member states in central and eastern Europe over the coming decades, given its strong trade links in the region. Trade relations are expected to be further enhanced as the new member states become more fully integrated, despite continued political conflict between the new member states and the western EU members. However, Austria will remain dependent on the older member states of the EU for its exports. Many of these countries face the same challenges as Austria, including a negative demographic outlook (albeit not as negative in most cases as in many of the new member states) and tepid productivity growth; we therefore expect economic growth to remain moderate.
The traditional party dominance will continue to fray
Institutions and policy trends: Austria is a stable democracy with a well-entrenched rule of law that has underpinned macroeconomic stability over recent decades. Since the second world war, politics has largely been conducted as a system of grand bargains between the centre right and the centre left, which led to a stable political environment and few sharp changes in policy. The system of social partnership, offering trade unions and employers co-operative roles in aspects of economic policymaking, plays an important part in ensuring political and social stability. Although this system is likely to decline in importance as the traditional mainstream parties remain under pressure-reflected in the inclusion in government of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) following the 2017 election-we expect the political system to remain relatively stable. Significant reforms in the early 2000s saw Austria attempt to liberalise sheltered sectors of the economy, privatise and slim down the public sector, and encourage entrepreneurship. Liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has proceeded fairly well, but a high degree of state ownership and regulation remains in the electricity sector, and reforms of competition in the services sector also have been slow. The increasingly fluid political landscape has the potential to lead to limited reform in some areas, although some of this could be counterproductive, especially with regard to the free movement of labour and goods.
Long-term performance: Overall, long-term prospects for the Austrian economy are broadly in line with much of the rest of the euro zone. We expect real GDP per head to grow by an average of 1.4% in 2018-50. The demographic profile is not as challenging as for some other euro zone countries (notably Germany), but will nevertheless act as a drag on long-term headline growth prospects. Continued progress on pensions, labour market and healthcare reform will be crucial in this regard. Greater competition in services would boost long-term growth prospects.
Faced with global competition, increasing investment in education and improving the outcomes of research and development (R&D) activity will be crucial. There is now a stronger emphasis on R&D (Austria is third in the EU in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of GDP, at 3.1% in 2016), and education reform is aimed at accelerating the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A particular challenge will be raising the educational standards of second- and third-generation immigrants, and integrating the large numbers of recently arrived asylum-seekers into the labour market. An increase in the number of older workers should stimulate growth and employment in traditional sectors of the economy, but there may be a shortage of skilled labour in areas such as information and communications technology (ICT) and biotechnology.

Climate change and sustainability
Under the EU's plans to meet the target of the international Paris Agreement, which is an agreement within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to limit global warming to well below 2°C, Austria is required to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16% by 2020 and 36% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Austria is broadly on course to meet its interim target to reduce emissions by 16% by 2020. However, this success can be attributed in part to lower than expected economic growth at the start of the target period, which began in 2013 (when GDP growth stalled). Annual emissions have come in below the annual targets since the start of the period, but have been rising since 2014. In 2016 Austria's total emissions were up by 1% on the previous year, at 79.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. The Environment Agency Austria forecasts that this trend will continue to 2020, but that Austria will (probably) still meet its 2020 target, as it will be able to offset any excess with its savings to date. However, the 2030 target will be much more challenging to meet.
The new government affirmed its commitment to combating global climate change and to achieving these targets in the coalition agreement published in December 2017. In May 2018 it published a national climate and energy strategy, as required by the EU, setting out how it intends to achieve its 2030 targets. The strategy foresees a range of measures and investments across different sectors, rather than any overarching headline reform. The most ambitious goal is in the energy sector, with a target (inherited from the previous government) to achieve 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and "total decarbonisation", with all energy supply coming from renewables (compared with 33.5% in 2017), by 2050. Austria has a strong starting base in terms of renewable energy, owing to its extensive hydropower network, which dates back to the 1940s and was enabled by the country's mountainous topography. Nevertheless, achieving this target will require significant infrastructural investment, notably in new renewables generation, energy storage and energy efficiency.
Political commitment to making these investments is only lukewarm and we therefore expect only a limited effort. This is despite a clear threat to the tourism sector from increasing temperatures and the associated potential negative impact on winter sports tourism. The changing climate is already affecting the skiing season, forcing ski resorts to make more use of artificial snow to extend the season and thereby earnings. As tourism earnings are equivalent to about 5% of GDP, and a significant proportion of this comes from winter tourism, climate change represents a larger risk to the economy than in many other developed economies.
Technological developments
Austria is well placed to deal with the economic impact of technological change. In our Technological Readiness Ranking, it ranked joint fourth. With a score of 9.16 out of 10, Austria scores perfectly across almost all sub-indicators, including internet use, scope of e-government and research infrastructure, only missing the threshold for the top score in cybersecurity preparedness and patent applications. The latter is driven mostly by its small size, as this indicator is not corrected for population size, and the country is thus broadly in line with countries like the Netherlands and Germany.
As with Germany, a specific challenge for Austria's government will be to encourage its strong manufacturing base, which is often highly integrated with German industry, to make use of new technologies. The share of industry in GDP, at about 30%, is among the highest in western Europe; in the Netherlands, for instance, it is only about 18%. Austria, like its northern neighbour, Germany, is faced with threats from new manufacturing centres in Asia. It has created an Industrie 4.0 platform to promote the use of new technologies in manufacturing by bringing together different stakeholders. According to research by EY, a consultancy, 60% of Austrian manufacturers already at least partly use digital technology in their production-above the share in Germany (54%). However, automation and newer technologies such as artificial intelligence play only a very limited role at present.
Another way in which the government hopes to make the economy more future-proof is through increasing spending on research and development (R&D). This is already relatively high, with total R&D spending as a share of GDP of 3.1% in 2016, compared with an average of 2% of GDP in the EU as a whole. Almost two-thirds of this spending is by the business sector; the government sector is the only one that spends less on R&D as a percentage of GDP than the EU average. The government is aiming to push up overall R&D spending to 3.76% of GDP and plans do this by increasing spending by the federal government.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed administration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,500% at the end of 2017 and will exceed 700,000% by end-2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, making the country the least attractive investment location in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition. Property rights remain weak.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Opaque currency controls add to uncertainty, severely restrict private-sector access to foreign exchange and impede trade. New government in 2019 starts to remove exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Amid severely high inflation, financing remains only available in the short term and banking sector shrinks in real terms.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2.1% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22. The opposition, of which the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disenfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. Thus, they are incapable of channelling the anger generated by the country's economic crisis.
In this context, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen with military or political connections. The accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls, subsidised imports, clientelism, and control of wasteful public-sector companies. Within this arrangement, factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, resulting in different civic-military factions coexisting within the regime. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage system is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of foreign-exchange inflows into the country.
Jeopardising the civic-military alliance is the unrest caused by the economic crisis and its ultimate source, the decline in oil production due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been highlighted by periodic purges in the military and re-organisations in the regime. In June Mr Maduro reshuffled key positions in the administration, giving increased power to Diosdado Cabello. Mr Cabello, a long-time internal rival who has extensive military and business ties, will now lead the Constituent Assembly (ANC, the country's de facto legislature). We interpret this as Mr Maduro attempting to regain internal support, even at the expense of personal power. Regardless, discontent seems to remain, as exemplified in July by unusually public criticism of the administration by other high-ranking PSUV members. Although Mr Cabello is a leading PSUV figure it is unclear if his recent elevation will quell discontent within the party.
An economic plan launched by Mr Maduro on August 20th is self-defeating, and will further place strain on the regime. Indeed, unless the administration turns PDVSA around (we see this as unlikely, as the government lacks the required expertise or financing), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse in 2019. This process may be hastened if exports are disrupted by external forces, such as US government sanctions on the oil trade (the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market) or asset seizures stemming from unpaid debts.
Regardless of the timing, what happens following the internal fracture is hard to predict. The transition is likely to be violent. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current set-up is likely to unleash jostling for position between the PSUV's varied civic-military factions. If no faction secures sufficient internal consensus, a period of chaos of indeterminate duration may ensue.
Alternatively, the regime may reconfigure itself, with an outright military government or PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy administration. Either of these would probably look to Russia and China, erstwhile backers, for aid to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. However, we believe that the required financing-tens of billions of US dollars per year-is beyond Russia's means. Despite recent announcements, China has scaled back its financial support for Venezuela since 2015. Even with these financing sources unavailable, the reconfigured regime may still reach internal stability and-given the opposition's weakness-remain in power, albeit resigned to the impoverished state of the country and PDVSA.
However, given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government, and we expect regime pragmatists to seek western assistance-specifically from multilaterals and governments. As these financiers will demand democratic reforms, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded regime leaders allow opposition participation to gain international legitimacy. Given past behaviour, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate.
The main risk to this "mixed administration" baseline view is that regime pragmatists will be unable to convince other regime members of the benefit of this arrangement. Democratic reforms that western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. Similarly, foreign financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the ANC and violent supporters of the current regime, known as colectivos. If these risks materialise in sufficient force, our alternative scenarios-a permanently impoverished nation or chaos of indeterminate duration-could materialise.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts, and we expect the remainder of the forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Mr Maduro was comfortably re-elected in elections on May 20th that were neither free nor fair. We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Based on our assumption that a mixed administration will take power, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The most effective measures have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Sanctions banning the oil trade outright are not part of our baseline assumption, but a hawkish US foreign policy team increases the risk of this happening. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address the country's economic crisis. Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs.
An economic plan launched on August 20th included the introduction of a new currency, the bolívar soberano (BsS), which replaced the bolívar fuerte (BsF) at a rate of BsF100,000:BsS1. The plan also announced a 5,900% increase in the minimum wage and a devaluation from BsS2.5:US$1 to BsS60:US$1. Despite promising to abolish the monetisation of public deficits, available data for September shows extremely fast growth in money supply. This and its other inconsistencies lead us believe that the plan will be ineffectual. As such, monetary imbalances will persist and foreign-exchange will continue to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that drives our baseline forecast of a move towards a mixed administration.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented. However, the mixed administration will face the same constraints that Mr Maduro has faced: the regime's civic-military factions enjoy wealth and power owing to the state's indirect and direct control of the economy; changing the status also means upsetting the regime's internal stability. Thus, we expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. Internal cohesiveness in the mixed administration will be key, as the PSUV is ideologically opposed to such borrowing and multilateral financing is likely to come with conditions on democratic reforms. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output up. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or, given strains in the PSUV, a change in leadership. ConocoPhillips (US) and Crystallex (Canada) are attempting to collect legal awards by attempting to seize PDVSA assets in the US and the Caribbean. Asset seizures could hit exports, the regime's economic lifeline. So far, the government has renegotiated or stalled via appeals.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. In early September, after the announcement of the new economic plan, money supply (M2) grew by 99.3% month on month. Despite promises of reducing money supply growth, the government's policy has been reduced to taking five zeroes off the currency. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is possible
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to the productive base, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated 14% shrinkage in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages-despite minimum wage increases-of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also continue to contract, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in investment in the oil sector.
Oil output-long in decline owing to mismanagement and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.1m barrels/day (b/d) in late 2019, down from 2m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 223% in August (205,496% year on year). This and the inflationary nature of the government's new economic plan has led us to significantly increase our inflation forecast for end-2018 to over 700,000%.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%. The economic plan announced in August took the official rate from BsS2.5:US$1 to BsS60:US$1. At the same time the government announced the "free convertibility" of foreign exchange, but in practice the exchange controls remain. The official rate is determined by an auction system, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early September the black-market exchange rate was around BsS90:US$1; the official rate stood at BsS61.5:US$1.
Under our current baseline, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$12bn in 2018. This figure is buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt (US$5.5bn) and our exclusion of repayments to Chinese lenders-a decision taken to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on debt, on which our forecasts are based. We expect the government to continue to accumulate arrears into 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the surge in imports to tip the current account into a deficit of US$1.2bn (or 1.5% of GDP) in 2020. As the government will then be complying with its debt obligations, the restructured debt will actually mean increased outflows in interest payments. This, coupled with the slow recovery of the oil sector and years of unmet import demand, will mean that the current-account deficit will remain high, at over 4% of GDP on average in 2021-22.
However, we expect that the new administration will secure enough financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilising balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Norway--highlights: Political outlook
The September 2017 general election produced a centre-right majority in parliament. The Liberals joined the government in January 2018, but the administration-comprising the Conservatives, the Progress Party (FrP) and the Liberals-remains an unstable minority. The Christian Democrats (KrF) decided to go into opposition. Nevertheless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this government to last its full term until 2021, and does not exclude the possibility of the KrF joining the coalition at some point during the 2018-22 forecast period. The current administration will try to push for a right-wing economic agenda while keeping a tight stance on migration. Climate policy will also remain high on the agenda owing to the Liberals' presence in office. Tensions between the often populist FrP and the opposition parties, including the KrF, will remain.

Norway's business environment outlook score rises between the historical and forecast periods, prompting an improvement in both the global and the regional rankings, to 11th and 7th positions respectively. Norway's political environment, macroeconomic backdrop and financing opportunities are expected to remain among the best in the world. The banking system is in good health. Notwithstanding the slump in global energy prices last year, Norway's enormous oil wealth acts as a financial cushion for the economy, contributing to macroeconomic stability. Despite this, the country trails Denmark, Finland and Sweden as a prime business location, held back by limited market opportunities, an excessively regulated labour market, relatively high labour costs and taxes.

Annual real GDP growth is forecast to average 1.9% in the forecast period, broadly in line with western Europe. Investment and employment in the offshore sector were significantly affected by the decline in global oil prices from mid-2014, but the economy started to recover in late 2016. As the oil industry has implemented most of the difficult adjustments, petroleum-related capital spending should return to growth in the forecast period; the mainland economy (excluding the offshore sector) is also strengthening. The economic outlook will be closely tied to developments in the global energy market, but the government will continue its efforts towards diversifying the economy. The fiscal and current-account surpluses will remain substantial, albeit lower than historical levels.

Population growth   1.0 0.9
Working-age population growth   0.8 0.6
Labour force growth   0.7 0.5
Norway's demographic profile is gradually worsening, with the proportion of the population aged over 67 expected to climb to 18% by the end of the forecast period. This is in line with most developed countries, but is a lower share than in many of Norway's European peers. With a working-age share of 65.5% in 2022-higher than in Finland and Sweden-the demographic outlook seems comparatively positive. Norway has attracted migrant workers from eastern Europe-owing to the fact that the country belongs to the European Economic Area (EEA), this is likely to continue. Non-European immigration has also been high, and this is a point of contention for the far-right FrP. The party will continue to push for greater regulation, but we do not expect further tightening of the immigration law.

Market opportunities are constrained by the small size of the population (5.3m in 2017). However, Norwegian households are among the wealthiest in the world, with GDP per head of US$61,372 in 2017 measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. At market exchange rates, GDP per head in US dollar terms has fallen sharply, to US$75,484 in 2017, from around US$100,000 in 2011-14. We forecast that GDP per head at market exchange rates will rise to US$99,530 by 2022.

With labour force participation rates already among the highest in the world, Norway has less scope to increase labour utilisation than most other developed economies. After being relatively subdued since 2007, labour productivity growth has picked up in recent years, and we expect it to remain broadly stable throughout the forecast period. Over our long-term forecast period, which runs until 2050, growth in the capital stock will make the greatest contribution to real GDP growth, which we expect to average 1.7% per year.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost without interruption in 1935-65 and largely dominated politics until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party (Sp)-the first majority government for two decades, and the coalition was re-elected in 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. They remained in power after the September 2017 election, but the Liberals decided to join the coalition in January 2018.
Political structure: A general election is held every four years and there is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system in which 150 out of the 169 members of the Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more 4% of the national vote and whose initial count seat (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote. The Storting has only one chamber.
Policy issues: Another centre-right government will try to implement additional business-friendly policies, as well as tax cuts. Near-term efforts will be focused on further reducing the negative spillover effects of the lower oil price on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund will remain higher than before 2016, but it will remain comfortably within the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tension will persist in the Storting about the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: The gradual phase-in of lower corporation tax has been completed. As of 2018, Norway has a 22% rate, down from 27% in 2015. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration of oil and gas. Capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes around half of total goods export revenue. The trade account registered a surplus of US$8.3bn in 2017, the lowest level since 1999, but is set to rebound from this year and continue to rise gradually thereafter on the back of higher oil prices.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The 2017 election delivered a win for the centre right, which now controls 88 seats out of 169, compared with 80 held by the centre left. The Labour Party remains the biggest party in parliament (49 seats), followed by the Conservatives (45) and the far-right Progress Party (FrP), with 27. The Liberals decided to join forces with the previous government-the Conservatives and the FrP-and entered the coalition in January 2019, with the aim of influencing environment policy. The ambition of Erna Solberg, the prime minister and leader of the Conservatives, is to lead a coalition involving the four centre-right parties, that is the Christian Democrats (KrF); however, the party opted to go to opposition, although it still leans more towards the right, meaning it will hardly side with the centre-left to topple the current administration, which has had an unstable term so far. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not exclude the KrF joining the government at some point during the 2018-22 forecast period.

Political outlook: Political stability
Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus that typically delivers a high level of political stability. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing its full four-year term. The September 2017 election was followed by a period of protracted talks that culminated in the Liberals joining the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) in government in January 2018, in exchange for concessions on environmental policy. The ruling coalition is one of the weakest in years, controlling only 80 seats in the 169-seat parliament-five short of a majority. Nevertheless, we expect it to last its full term, to 2021.
The grand ambition of Erna Solberg, the prime minister and leader of the Conservatives, was a "bourgeois" coalition-involving all four centre-right parties. However, the KrF, which secured eight seats in parliament, decided to break with the centre-right bloc, owing to ideological differences with the FrP on migration and climate policy; the party currently holds the balance of power in the parliament.
The coalition's first few months in office have been plagued by political instability. In March the outspoken immigration critic, Sylvi Listhaug, from the FrP, resigned as justice and immigration minister, after making the statement that the Labour Party prioritised the rights of Islamic terrorists over national security. In mid-August the government suffered another blow with the resignation of Per Sanders from his post as fisheries minister and FrP's deputy leader, after it surfaced he had breached security protocol while travelling. This brought security-which remains a very sensitive issue in Norway following the far-right attacks conducted by an extremist, Anders Breivik, in 2011-back to the top of the political agenda. It is currently perceived that Ms Solberg has failed to improve "preparedness" and secure crucial infrastructure during her (almost) five years in office. Opposition parties have tried to use this to undermine the ruling coalition, and could put forward a no-confidence vote when parliament re-opens in October. Nevertheless, we expect the government to survive the censure motion, since the KrF is unlikely to side with the centre left on this.
Political instability will persist in the short term, especially as the government continues its controversial state reform-which involves the forced merger of some municipalities and counties. Moreover, Ms Listhaug could return to active political life as she is likely to be nominated as FrP's next deputy leader. This could lead to a deterioration in relations between the coalition parties. Despite this, we expect the government to serve a full term, benefiting from a strong economy (on the back of rising global oil prices and a dynamic labour market). Although the KrF has chosen to remain in opposition, it remains mostly aligned with a liberal economic agenda, and is likely to continue to prefer the current centre-right government to a Labour-led one. Support for the party has been declining, to below the 4% parliamentary threshold in the latest opinion polls. The KrF's decision to go into opposition is contested, and the party is divided on the issue (an estimated 22% of members prefer a centre-left government over a centre-right one). Intra-party tensions could rise further, and Knut Arild Hareide may be forced to resign as the party's leader. We do not exclude the possibility of the KrF joining the government at some point during the forecast period.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Norway will continue to score highly for the effectiveness of its governmental system for policy formulation and implementation. The government delivers high-quality services, and corruption is largely absent from political and business life. However, one flaw of the system can be excessive bureaucracy.
Legislation passes through a committee system in the Storting (parliament); the aim is usually to build a cross-party consensus, and only the most controversial measures lead to a parliamentary vote. One exception concerns EU legislation, which is transposed into Norwegian law through the country's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the past, the Storting often did not examine this legislation, but since 2007 there has been more stringent scrutiny. Norway is unlikely to apply for full EU membership during the forecast period. There are concerns in the FrP about EU immigration but, despite the party's participation in government, we do not expect Norway to hold a referendum on EU immigration (as Switzerland did in February 2014).
Policymaking is mainly centred in the capital, Oslo, but policy is implemented by a well-functioning decentralised governmental system. Norway's two-tier subnational government system is composed of municipalities and counties, which-regardless of their size-have equal rights and responsibilities. Municipal functions include first levels of education, health and social care, and local town planning and infrastructure. County functions comprise regional planning and development, roads and public transport, and upper-secondary education, among others. The Conservative-led government undertook a "municipal reform" (kommunesammenslaing) in 2014, to reduce costs and bureaucracy, as well as to provide better services. Thus, this reform is aimed at merging some of the 428 municipalities to give local governments better economies of scale. In June 2017 the central government formally received parliamentary support to reduce the number of municipalities to 354 and to merge some of the 19 counties by 2020, which will leave Norway with half the current number of counties. The reform will continue to be highly controversial for some voters, and around ten of the new local governments will result from forced mergers of some municipalities. We expect these centralisation efforts to continue in the coming years.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next local elections will be held in 2019, and the next general election will take place in 2021.
Political outlook: International relations
Relations with the EU will remain one of the principal foreign policy issues, particularly in the light of the UK's vote to leave the bloc. As a member of the EEA, Norway has access to the single market (for a fee), but must accept most EU regulations without having any influence over them.
Tensions between the US administration and the EU have risen since early 2018, owing to the sharpening of protectionist rhetoric of Donald Trump, the US president. However, pressure has eased since Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Mr Trump agreed to hold talks in late July on eliminating barriers to bilateral trade. We expect the US and the EU to reach a limited trade agreement that reduces trade tariffs in some non-automotive sectors. However, there is a substantial risk that Mr Trump will break off negotiations if he does not consider the potential deal to be sufficiently beneficial to the US.
Norway has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the conflict in Ukraine and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. We believe that EU, US and Norwegian sanctions are likely to remain in place in the medium term. National security has become a greater priority since Russia's annexation of Crimea and its subsequent increase in military activity along the 196-km border that it shares with Norway. US marines have been stationed in Norway (about 1,500 km from the Russian border) since January 2017 in six-month deployments for cold-weather training and exercises with Norwegian forces, which have been perceived negatively by Russia.

Norway's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises solidly, from 7.94 in the historical period (2013-17) to 8.17 in the forecast period (2018-22), underpinned by a significant strengthening of underlying macroeconomic and financing conditions, as well as an improved tax environment. This prompts Norway to climb in our global ranking, from 14th to 11th. However, the improvement in the country's business environment only lifts it up by one position, to 7th, in our regional ranking. This leaves Norway's business environment behind those of its Nordic neighbours. Indeed, Denmark, Sweden and Finland take up the top three positions.
In the forecast period there will be significant increases in the scores for macroeconomic environment, taxes and financing. There will be modest improvements in Norway's market opportunities, labour market and technological readiness categories. The only score that we expect to decrease is that for political stability, reflecting the weakness of Norway's current government and recent political uncertainty, which we expect to continue over the forecast period. All other scores will remain stable.
Despite the marginal deterioration in the political landscape, Norway will remain among the world's top business locations, owing to a strong record of pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, a modest regulatory burden and excellent transport, energy and digital infrastructure. Weaker aspects include the country's high personal tax burden (albeit supporting high-quality public services and social welfare), limited market opportunities, a somewhat rigid labour market and emerging shortages of skilled labour. A moderately less stable political environment poses the risk of a further gradual dilution of government effectiveness.

Business environment outlook: Norway's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA) maintains investigative vigilance to ensure effective merger control. Efforts in favour of privatisation remain modest.
2020-22: A strategic plan guides the NCA to improve competition in numerous sectors and in the procurement process.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The government announces offshore oil and gas licencing awards for new acreage in predefined, mature areas. Efforts intensify to source investment from outside of Sweden and from other traditional markets, principally from China.
2020-22: A new national security law starts to have an impact on Norway's attractiveness as a business destination.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Progress is made on a US-EU trade agreement. The risk that the US administration breaks off negotiations, however, is substantial. Focus on Brexit talks and the implications for Norwegian trade.
2020-22: No change in policy towards joining the EU or leaving the European Economic Area (EEA). A reassessment of EEA membership is a more realistic alternative, but remains unlikely. Efforts to promote bilateral trade deals continue.
Taxes
2018-19: The government looks into reducing income tax, now that the corporation tax has been lowered. Generous state subsidies provided to oil and gas companies are reviewed.
2020-22: Greater use of environmental taxes to meet climate-change goals.
Financing
2018-19: New capital requirements for financial institutions are implemented. Tighter credit standards on high-risk oil and gas, real estate, and shipping sectors. Rise in fees and equity capital requirements for commercial borrowers.
2020-22: Norges Bank (the central bank) raises interest rates further to mitigate inflationary pressure as economic growth strengthens. Financial sector regulation further improved. Foreign-exchange access unhindered.
The labour market
2018-19: Reforms introduced to increase workforce supply. The Working Environment Act, tackling flexible contracts, is maintained.
2020-22: Bargaining between social partners is dominated by demands for catch-up wages. Skills shortages remain an issue.
Infrastructure
2018-19: A ten-year transport plan (2018-29) focuses on maintenance, climate change and the introduction of new technologies. More opportunities for public-private partnerships.
2020-22: Investments in new road and rail transport links, and upgrades to existing transport infrastructure. Digital infrastructure upgrades continue.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Bolstering of Norway's cyber-defence strategy, after several cyber-attacks targeting crucial public infrastructure.

The macroeconomic environment has strengthened steadily in the past two years, supported by a recovery in global energy prices, which has had positive spillover effects on the labour market, consumer and business confidence, the public finances and capital spending. Underlying conditions point to a reasonably stable economic outlook, with continued solid public finances, a large current-account surplus, substantial corporate and household savings, and reduced imbalances (the housing market is of concern to policymakers). Domestically, the main risks stem from highly indebted households (in the context of a dynamic housing market and monetary policy tightening) and increasing capacity pressures in the labour market, which could constrain medium-term growth potential. In the long term, however, the main risk will be Norway's lack of economic diversity, with oil and gas (and related activities) still accounting for more than 50% of the country's total exports. An increase in global trade protectionism and a downturn in global stockmarkets represent the biggest near-term external risks.
Structurally, public finances will remain in better shape than in most peer economies, owing to prudent fiscal policy and Norway's huge sovereign wealth fund-which acts as a financial cushion. Although Norway runs a fiscal surplus, its debt level is higher than might be expected, at around 36% of GDP; although this is mainly explained by monetary policy operations conducted by Norges Bank (the central bank). The conduct of monetary policy will remain credible, and the bank will continue operating a free-float currency regime. Interest rates are expected to rise gradually throughout the forecast period against a backdrop of close-to-target inflation and firm real GDP growth. However, the bank will have to balance policy tightening against a potential appreciation in the krone.

Competition is encouraged, but strongly policed
Norwegian governments of all persuasions tend to be strongly committed to competition, legislating in line with EU law as required by the country's membership of the EEA. The current centre-right government will continue its efforts to defend private-enterprise culture; however, major privatisation attempts will be muted. The power to investigate competition and enforce competition law will remain vested in the Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA), operating independently under the auspices of the Ministry of Trade & Industry, and the Ministry of Fisheries. The NCA is well-staffed (with more than 100 employees; mostly economists and lawyers), making it effective in merger control, the policing of cartels and abuse of market dominance, as well as in the investigation of the impact of government policy on competition. The NCA raids office premises when necessary, and has stepped up its merger control by banning three prospective mergers (a record number) in 2016 in the ferry, forestry and pizza markets. The NCA has taken action against bid rigging, imposed large fines for collusion in the publishing industry and fined Telenor, Norway's largest telecommunications provider, for the abuse of its dominant position. The authority works closely with European regulators on cross-border mergers, and the newly established Competition Appeals Committee will improve the process of legal redress for companies contesting decisions. Another revision to the Competition Act, passed in 2016, harmonises merger control with EU law and allows for Norwegian settlements in cartel cases.
Plans by the right-wing government to privatise some of the state-controlled companies have seen modest to zero progress over the past five years. The Conservatives' attempt partially to privatise Statkraft, a renewable-energy company, was criticised by the opposition. The government did sell the state's remaining stake in SAS, the Scandinavia airline, but this move should not be seen as a privatisation drive by the government. The state's stakes in crucial sectors are still significant, including Equinor (formerly Statoil, 67%), a petroleum company; Telenor (54%), Yara (36%), a fertiliser manufacturer; Norsk Hydro (43.8%), an aluminium producer; and DNB bank (34%). Statkraft, a renewable energy company, and Statskog, a forestry and land-management company, remain fully public.
Under its strategic plan through to 2021, the NCA will aim to improve competition in numerous sectors, including fuel, retailing, health services and waste management, focusing on encouraging the supply of goods and services, and amending regulation. It will attempt to ensure that the procurement process is more cost efficient and less susceptible to abuse, looking intently into the effects of joint bidding, and on preventing firms from colluding.
In view of Norway's unique geography, the impact of local mergers will remain a priority. The NCA will also assess how changes in government policy affect competition between large and small companies, and review how financial penalties, regulation and legal redress can be combined to achieve its aims (for instance, by ensuring competition among taxi services).

The new government will continue to promote business-friendly measures
Norway has long had a co-operative stance towards foreign investors, abiding by its obligations as an EEA member, and broadly welcoming foreign capital and know-how, but with some political resistance to takeovers in strategic sectors. The long-term depletion of offshore hydrocarbon reserves and the pressing issues caused by the oil price crash in 2014 have given impetus to government efforts to pursue foreign investment to diversify the economy and complement the crucial offshore energy sector with new sources of wealth. The government is concentrating on attracting investment from China, principally in the seafood industry. However, these efforts have not been as fruitful as expected, leaving the oil and gas sector as the most important for foreign investors for the foreseeable future.
A new national security law was introduced in June 2018, which gives the government power to stop any foreign acquisitions of crucial sectors that may threaten national security. Companies wishing to acquire one-third of any business of vital security interest will be required to notify the relevant ministry. This is in line with an increasingly general trend of political interference in business acquisitions. The new law is likely to lead to an increase in workload for the affected Norwegian businesses in terms of notifications, assessments and dialogue with the authorities. It could also impair the competitiveness of, and reduce the investment risk appetite for, Norwegian companies that will be subject to the new regime.
The government established a dedicated inward-investment agency, "Innovation Norway", in 2004, which was the country's first. The government is focusing on attracting high-tech start-ups through the agency to compete more effectively with its Nordic neighbours. Investment in Norwegian start-ups has increased, facilitated by easier access to capital. The authorities will continue to encourage business formation via increasing funding for research, improving tax incentives and tackling red tape to overcome traditional blocks on the development of non-oil-related business.
Although Swedish investors have historically dominated Norway's inward foreign direct investment (FDI), US investment is reportedly underestimated. The authorities will seek investment from elsewhere in Europe, and increasingly from China and the rest of Asia. "Invest in Norway" is a governmental investment promotion agency. It will focus on attracting investment in non-oil sectors, including the maritime and seafood, renewable energy, medical, biotechnology, and "clean-tech" industries.
The government has released a list of rail services to be put out to tender from December 2018, with foreign companies able to bid against the Norwegian State Railways for routes that will be bundled into two packages.
Foreign investors will continue to be offered new blocks to explore for oil and gas on the Norwegian continental shelf, based on ordinary concession licensing rounds held every two years in frontier areas. In June 2018 the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy offered 12 new production licences to 11 companies in the 24th licensing round. The number of applicant companies fell to 11, from 26 in the previous round, which created some concern regarding interest in the Norwegian shelf. Nine of the licenses are focused on the Barents Sea and three in the Norwegian Sea. A ban on exploring for oil off the Lofoten, Senja and Vesteralen islands will continue on environmental grounds.

Norway favours free-trade policies and a lack of foreign-exchange controls
As Norway is a net energy exporter, with only a small domestic market and limited manufacturing capabilities, Norwegian governments of all persuasions adopt broadly pro-free-trade policies, despite the long-standing reluctance to join the EU and the protectionism afforded to home-produced agriculture. Except in extremis, foreign investors in Norway are guaranteed the absence of foreign-exchange controls, with an independent central bank overseeing a free-floating krone. Profits and dividends earned in all areas of the economy, including oil and gas, may be repatriated without obstruction, with no restrictions on capital inflows or outflows. Through Norway's membership of the EEA, Norwegian and foreign-owned companies in Norway gain full access to the single market. EU access guarantees the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between Norway and EU member states. Norway adopts around three-quarters of all single-market legislation, with the notable exceptions being laws that govern agriculture and fisheries. Norway will continue to work in favour of free trade, harmonising its duties and tariffs structure in line with World Trade Organisation (WTO) and EU agreements, and giving high priority to making new EEA rules applicable in Norway. This will allow it to maintain its excellent record of transposing EU rules into national law. Free trade outside the EU will be promoted mainly through the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA) by negotiating free-trade agreements (FTAs). There are currently 27 FTAs covering 38 countries. Norway has preferential trade arrangements with a growing number of countries outside of the EU, and has revived trade talks with China concerning energy sector co-operation and opening up the Chinese market for farmed salmon, as relations have thawed since 2017. Norway has followed the EU's lead in placing sanctions on Russia since mid-2014, leading to countervailing moves from Russia to block EU (including Norwegian) food imports and other items.
Norway may reassess its EEA membership
Norway is not a member of the EU and will not consider joining over the forecast period, as an increasing number of parties opposes membership. In addition to the well-known position of the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party (Sp), the Progress Party (FrP) has also made public its opposition to EU membership. Given insufficient political and public support, the Conservatives have set aside plans for another referendum on membership (the last one was held in 1994 and membership was rejected). A more realistic, but still unlikely, scenario is a reassessment of EEA membership.
The protectionist rhetoric and "America First" stance of the US administration have translated into the imposition of targeted measures (in March 2018 the US announced plans to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports). However, tensions between the US and the EU have eased since, and the two factions agreed to hold talks on eliminating barriers to bilateral trade. We expect the US and the EU to reach a limited trade agreement that reduces trade tariffs in some non-automotive sectors, given the economic importance of this relationship. However, there is a substantial risk that Donald Trump, the US president, will break off negotiations if he does not consider the potential deal to be sufficiently beneficial to the US.
Lobbying will intensify from businesses in northern Norway to withdraw from the EU's trade embargo on Russia, but Norway will remain party to the embargo as long as the EU's relations with Russia remain tense; retaliatory measures by Russia will continue to deprive Norwegian-based firms in the fisheries sector of an important market.
The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) will gradually come into force in 2018-22. It will eliminate most trade tariffs, ease border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation. In December 2017 the EU finalised an economic partnership agreement with Japan, to create the world's largest free-trade area. The deal will come into effect in early 2019, although there will be a lengthy transition phase for most measures over the next decade.

Tax reforms will scale back the overall tax burden
The tax system still contains distortions and is considered uncompetitive from an international perspective, which explains why, despite the improvement, Norway scores relatively poorly in this category. The government has undertaken reforms to make the business environment more attractive, and to shift the burden from direct to indirect, and to create more more growth-friendly, taxation.
As part of a multi-year programme of cuts designed to make Norway more tax competitive, the government has reduced the headline rate of corporate income tax from 27% in 2014 to 25% in 2016, and to 24% in 2017. In 2018 a further reduction (to 23%) was introduced. According to the IMF, this will bring Norway's effective tax rates closer to its regional peers. Offshore petroleum companies now pay a higher rate on income, which was raised to 54% in 2017, from 53% previously, with a lower rate of investment-based depreciation, the "rate of uplift", reduced from 5.5% to 5.4%. The tax on economic rent from hydropower production was raised by 1.3 percentage points, to 34.3%. Although the government is not likely to raise taxes further on hydrocarbon extraction, there is a strong possibility that it could review the incentives available for petroleum firms investing in discoveries-currently, the government covers 78% of the costs of searching for oil reserves if the company conducting the discovery does not make a profit.
The ordinary personal income rate has also been reduced, to 23% in 2018. Since 2016 the bracket tax is applied to four income brackets: 0.93% on incomes between Nkr164,100 (US$21,087) and Nkr230,950, 2.41% on incomes between Nkr230,950 and Nkr580,650, 11.52% on incomes between Nkr580,650 and Nkr934,050, and 14.52% on incomes above this threshold. This replaced the surtax system (an additional tax that applied only to the two highest income brackets). A financial activities tax also came into force in 2017.
Under a Conservative-led government, there are likely to be further tax reductions. In the election campaign, Erna Solberg, the prime minister, stated that she would pursue a more moderate reduction than the one implemented in 2013-17, worth Nkr22.4bn (US$2.4bn). Although a "wealth tax" is a long-term goal of the Conservatives, the party has already said that it will not seek to introduce it over the next parliamentary term.
The SkatteFUNN scheme acts as the framework for Norway's support for business innovation and targets enterprises that are at their early stage of development. It is a tax-deduction scheme for companies that are engaged in research and development activities. This fiscal framework is qualification-based and regulated in the statutory framework, and is open to all branches of industry and all types of companies-regardless of size.

Norway is strengthening its macroprudential framework
Norway improves its score in the forecast period, as the financial regulatory framework continues to strengthen-keeping its top position in the regional ranking. There are few distortions in the financial system, which is run on sound market principles with adequate supervision. In most cases, banks not only meet, but exceed, Basel III requirements for Tier-1 capital-adequacy ratios, containing the risks stemming from commercial banks' exposure to the mortgage market and high household debt levels. The banking system has remained in a healthy state since the global financial crisis. This is because of lower risk exposures and only limited holdings of high-risk European government securities. Shared counterparty, and foreign-exchange exposure, risks are low, although Norway's banks may be vulnerable because of their exposure to oil and gas, property, and shipbuilding loan portfolios. Foreign companies have access to the same capital sources as domestic companies, but often work through foreign banks, which tend to have offices in Oslo, the capital, and in cities where the oil industry is based, especially Bergen and Stavanger. Access to investment finance is adequate, since tighter rules were established in the wake of the global financial crisis. Companies are able to obtain bank funding (subject to risk limits) and can also access the equity or bond markets, which-owing to the government's strong fiscal position-are more stable than in other countries. Foreign-exchange access will remain unhindered as the authorities maintain a free-float currency outside the euro zone, with no capital controls.
Bank lending will remain the primary source of credit for commercial enterprises. Regulation will be tightened further, but mainly targeted towards higher-risk household and personal mortgage borrowing. New measures were introduced in 2017, such as an interest-rate stress test (a sensitivity test) when assessing the borrower's repayment capacity, a cap on the loan-to-value ratio (at 85% for new homes, and at 60% for second homes) and a loan-to-income requirement. The countercyclical capital buffer requirement increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2018, to 2%. Equity capital requirements and fees for commercial borrowers will rise proportionately, mitigated by healthy competition in the market for company loans.
Bank financing of existing small and medium-sized enterprises, and new start-ups, will remain restricted. However, low-cost financing will continue to be available from other sources, including the debt and equity markets, non-resident banks and, increasingly, venture capital to facilitate the development of high-tech, niche sectors.
Borrowing rates will remain low, but will rise gradually throughout our forecast period. Regulation of the financial sector will be continually improved, which may affect the ability to lend, but non-resident access to the financial system is assured for well-known corporations, and for those with viable business plans and/or solid track records.

Skills mismatches among immigrants will have to be addressed
Benefiting from its high-quality education system and controlled immigration, Norway's labour market offers high levels of managerial expertise and language skills, as well as one of the highest productivity growth rates in Europe. Central-level bargaining between the government, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) involves a high degree of co-ordination, with blue-collar manufacturing wages providing the bench-mark for sector-specific and company-level bargaining. On the negative side, there is a large public sector and a scarcity of skills in private industry stemming from low unemployment rates, a lack of labour mobility restricting opportunities for the economic development of remote regions, and a mismatch of education and skills among immigrants and asylum-seekers settling in Norway. High aspirations for wages and entitlements contribute to workforce welfare, but also add to business operating costs. According to the OECD, unit costs remain comparatively high despite the major currency depreciation in 2014. Strike action is a familiar feature of the main and intermediate settlement process in the public sector and among offshore petroleum industry workers seeking higher pay rates and benefits-which contributes to bringing the score on this category down. However, the government reserves the right to enforce arbitration in disputes that are likely to have a major impact on the economy or to be detrimental to public health. Industrial action is possible but is likely to be avoided through arbitration. We do not expect the government to seek to curb trade union power.
Tighter immigration control, an improving labour market, and divergent sectoral trends will contribute to the mismatch of demand and supply of crucial skills. The government is likely to take additional measures to close this gap.
High labour costs remain an important challenge. There has been a shift in businesses in developed countries; they are moving towards the high end of the value chain in order to ensure survival in an increasingly competitive world. However, given Norway's production costs, prices rose to a higher level in the economy. According to the OECD the average wage remains comparatively high-at around EUR50/hour- with Sweden and Denmark registering EUR40/h, and other countries in Europe EUR30/h. The problem has been accentuated in recent years by wage growth outpacing productivity growth.

Norway's physical transport and digital infrastructure networks are adequate for a well-equipped, modern and advanced industrialised nation, with few of the problems, such as traffic congestion, affecting countries with higher population densities. Good ferry and internal air transport services, including oil-rig helicopter links, help to prevent Norway's diverse topography and weather-related vulnerabilities from creating logistical problems. Rock fall, flooding and landslide risks, alongside the ongoing requirement to increase the connectivity of cities and regions, place constant demands on the public purse to maintain roads, bridges and tunnels, and rail, air and maritime transport systems, as well as public transport links. Norway's digital infrastructure is among the most highly advanced in the world. In recent years, many rapidly expanding start-ups have emerged, enhancing household and business online usage, with almost all basic services available digitally in the present day. Telecommunications coverage and quality is very high. Providers are quick to roll out improvements to the high-speed broadband network.
Infrastructure policy will be steered by a National Transport Plan for 2018-29, which focuses on maintenance of transport infrastructure, pollution reduction and stronger public-private co-operation, as well as the increasing use of intelligent transport systems. The plan's baseline scenario allocates 58% of the total budget of Nkr418.5m (US$45.6m) for road improvements; 32% for railways (which includes new double-track lines for intercity routes, Oslo-Skien and Halden-Lillehammer, and a second light-rail line in Bergen, to Fyllingsdalen, a borough in the south of the city); and another 3% to sea infrastructure that will benefit the fishing and shipping industries.
The main international airport, Gardermoen, has undergone an expansion programme to enable it to cater for 32m passengers per year, and it was officially reopened in 2017. This has delivered an expanded arrivals and departures hall, a new baggage system and a modified, adjoining rail station, at a total cost of Nkr14bn. Bodo Airport in the northern, coastal region is being relocated, releasing prime real estate on the existing site for development.
There are ambitious plans for "floating fixed tunnels" to be constructed under seven fjords by 2035. The government will also invest in new transport-related technologies to improve efficiency and road safety, and to meet environmental targets.

Norway scores decently on a regional and global basis, reflecting the quality of e-commerce business and scope of e-government services; widespread internet usage and a high number of patent registrations. Norway's score for cybersecurity preparedness, R&D spending and quality of research infrastructure are weaker, but still high by regional comparison. Total investment in R&D was 2% of GDP in 2016, slightly below the OECD average of 2.3%, and well below its Nordic neighbours' levels, at 2.9% for Denmark and 3.3% for Sweden. In the European Innovation Scoreboard 2017 the country scores particularly well for lifelong learning, small and medium enterprise's in-house innovation, and sales of new innovations. Weaker aspects include the level of business R&D spending and the quality of tertiary education.
In January 2018 the government contracted Telenor to propose best practice in the implementation of effective cyber-defence strategies, with the aim of protecting critical Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems. This was done in the context of an increasing number of cyber-attacks on state-run infrastructure, including the public transport company, NSB, military sites and hospitals. Telenor is working closely with the Norwegian Defence Forces (NDF), in particular with its cyber-defence unit, in this area. The company plans to roll out advanced cyber-security tools ahead of NATO's upcoming Trident Juncture 2018 exercises, scheduled for November.
In August 2018 some of Norway's biggest companies announced that they would join forces to establish a national powerhouse for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the country's quality and capacity for research, education and innovation in the field. The platform's name is the "Open AI Lab", and it is supported by Telenor, the NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) and SINTEF, a research company. The lab is an expansion of the Telenor-NTNU AI-Lab, created back in 2016. Other partners will be DNB, a financial services company, DNV GL, a registrar and classification company, Equinor, and the Kongsberg Group, a technology firm.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Norway was strongly affected by the negative global energy price shock in late 2014, which had knock-on effects on the petroleum industry and its suppliers. Investment in the sector fell by an annual average of 11% in 2015-17, unemployment peaked at 5% in mid-2016 and industrial production remains subdued, with output of machinery and equipment registering heavy declines in 2016-17. Norway's need for economic diversification has been brought into sharp relief. In recent years the government's main priority has been to improve the country's competitiveness by trying to bring tax and wage levels closer to those of its peers. A multiparty agreement in 2015, aimed at reducing the headline rate of corporate tax from 27% to 23% in 2018, was gradually implemented, and efforts have been made to reduce bureaucracy and public-sector inefficiencies. The government has identified the aluminium industry, the healthcare sector, fish farming and fisheries, and green technology as potential areas for growth.
Norway's financial system is solid and well capitalised, but high household debt levels will continue to pose risks to medium-term macroeconomic stability. After years of spectacular growth, in February 2018 house prices declined by 2.3% compared with their year-earlier peak. Since then prices have recovered, in line with The Economist Intelligence Unit's view that the market was correcting only temporarily. Tighter credit standards that came into effect in 2017-a cap on the loan/value ratio at 85% (and 60% for second homes in Oslo, the capital)-reined in primary demand and speculation. Nevertheless, with household debt at 230% of disposable income, further price corrections or a potential interest-rate rise, expected in the second half of this year, by Norges Bank (the central bank) could affect macroeconomic stability and weigh on economic activity.

Norway's fiscal policy framework is designed to insulate the budget from fluctuations in oil and gas revenue, with the government responsible for transferring the state's net oil revenue to the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), currently valued at Nkr8.8tr (US$1.1tr).
After a budget surplus equivalent to 4.4% of GDP in 2017, we expect the surplus to rise in 2018, to 5.4%. Economic growth will remain broadly stable, and although tax cuts will put pressure on the budget, their impact should be offset by a less expansive fiscal policy and a pick-up in global oil prices. The 2018 budget contains a set of growth-friendly measures aimed at improving competitiveness (the base tax rate on both personal and corporate income was lowered to 23%, from 24% and 25% respectively). This implies a lower fiscal impulse (the budget's contribution to economic growth) than the expansive 2016-17 period. As with many previous budgets, the 2018 budget complies with the fiscal rule, which limits the government's withdrawals from the GPFG to 3% of its value. In 2018 withdrawals are set to amount to 2.7%, but this will be the third consecutive year in which they will offset annual net oil revenue.

Norges Bank's main policy rate-on sight deposits-has been at a record low of 0.5% since March 2016. At its latest policy meeting, on August 3rd, Norges Bank left its policy rate unchanged. The bank has a broader remit than some of its peers, with a focus on bolstering output, as much as on controlling inflation. In early March its remit was adjusted, reducing the inflation target from 2.5% to 2% and removing exchange-rate stabilisation as an objective. The build-up of financial imbalances will be considered when deciding on policy.
We expect the next policy rate rise to occur in September. Headline inflation has been above its target through most of the year thus far; the mainland economy (excluding the offshore sector) has strengthened significantly and is likely to accelerate this year; and prospects for the petroleum sector are positive. From 2019 onwards we believe that the key rate will increase gradually, to about 2.5% in 2022. Norges Bank's challenge in the medium term will be to gradually tighten monetary policy without triggering a sharp appreciation of the krone.

Norway's economic recovery has gathered steam, with real GDP growth accelerating to 2.4% in 2017 (revised up from 2%), from 0.9% in 2016. The main contributors to growth were private consumption and business investment (supported by buoyant construction activity).
In the medium term real GDP growth should remain broadly stable. Revisions to 2017 data and to statistics for growth in the first quarter of 2018 (down to 0.2%, from 0.6% previously) have led us to revise down our forecast for full-year growth, to 1.6%, from 1.9% previously. The mainland economy is likely to grow at a faster pace. Owing to a strong base in 2017, gross fixed capital formation growth will decelerate significantly, as the 6.4% quarterly contraction in investment in January-March 2018 illustrates (although firm growth throughout the remaining year should offset this). Recent surveys point to an acceleration in capital spending in the oil and gas sector, non-oil related services, retail, and public administration. Private consumption growth will remain firm, as consumer confidence levels are at their highest since the slump in oil prices in late 2014. Wage growth is set to accelerate significantly, and at a faster pace than inflation, on the back of an increasingly tight labour market.
Over our 2018-22 forecast period, private consumption and investment will remain the main drivers of economic advancement-GDP growth will average 1.9% annually in 2019-22. Real wage growth should accelerate from 0.6% this year to 1.2% by 2022 as the unemployment rate continues its downward trend (we expect it to reach 3.6% in 2022, from 4.2% in 2017). Investment will remain firm in response to gradually higher capacity constraints and as new petroleum projects begin.
Risks to our forecast are balanced in both the short and the medium term. Downside risks stem from the trade dispute between the US and China, and the increasingly protectionist rhetoric from Mr Trump, which could affect global trade flows more negatively than we currently expect. In contrast, a more robust pick-up in investment than we are forecasting, and faster wage growth than expected (as a stronger performance in the labour market could prompt revisions to the wage agreements) could lead to stronger domestic demand growth and, in turn, boost real GDP growth.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Norway's sectoral split has altered little over the past decade, and significant changes are unlikely during the forecast period. By far the largest sector is services, which accounts for over 64.8% of total output. Industry (including construction) represents 33% of GDP, and the petroleum sector accounts for the majority of this share. Oil and gas extraction (including related services) makes up one-quarter of Norway's gross value added. Agriculture, fishing and forestry account for 2.3% of GDP, although the fisheries sector is large by European standards, and makes an important contribution to the country's food-processing sector. Food and live animals account for 11% of total goods exports.
The most important parts of the services sector in terms of gross value added are business services; wholesale and retail trade; financial intermediation (mostly banking and insurance); property; and shipping, pipeline and other transport activities. Public administration and defence, provision of education, healthcare, and social services account for over one-fifth of total gross value. Our forecast for firm private consumption growth over the forecast period suggests continued growth of the services sector.
Agriculture and manufacturing will become less important to the economy
Norway's agricultural sector is smaller than those of its neighbours, with the arable land area around one-third of that in Denmark, Finland or Sweden. A decline in agricultural holdings has taken place over successive decades, but this has simply resulted in farms becoming far bigger. The importance of agriculture and forestry has decreased in recent years, whereas that of fishing and fish farming has risen. This trend is likely to continue, as the government will continue its efforts to attract more foreign investment and knowledge into the seafood industry.
As a result of the slimming down of formerly large industries-such as beverages and tobacco, textiles and clothing, and wood products-the manufacturing sector has declined in importance since 1970. Over the same period, Norway's oil industry has developed, and the supplier industry has become established. Manufacturing now accounts for just over 7% of gross value added, down from around 10% in 2000, with the pace of the reduction having picked up considerably during the global financial crisis. The two largest categories within manufacturing are the food industry and machinery groups. Machinery has suffered as the impact of the slump in the oil and gas sector since 2014 has filtered down the supply chain, with output contracting on a yearly basis until early 2018. The government would like to move away from its dependence on oil and gas, encouraging investment in high-skilled, high-value areas such as machinery and shipping, but any change is likely to take time. Hindered by Norway's high domestic wages, manufacturing expansion will be slow and, owing to dependence on oil and gas, as a proportion of gross value added it will continue to decline.
Investment in oil will pick up in 2019
The oil and gas sector is a major contributor to the economy, but has been losing importance in recent years, particularly since the oil price slump in 2014. In 2017 the petroleum sector accounted for 14% of GDP (down from a post-crisis peak of 22% in 2011-12), 17% of state revenue (down from 33% in 2012) and 40% of Norway's exports (down from a post-crisis peak of 52% in 2013). Nevertheless, with 85 offshore oilfields in production at end-2017, Norway is the tenth-largest oil exporter and the 15th-largest oil producer globally. It is also the third-largest gas exporter and the sixth-largest gas producer. The proceeds of hydrocarbons production have allowed huge transfers to the sovereign wealth fund, the market value of which totalled Nkr8.6trn (US$1.trn) in September 2018. Growth in discovered resources is ongoing, and the announcement in early 2011 of two new major discoveries-one in the Barents Sea and another in the North Sea-enlivened interest in the oil and gas sector.
According to Statistics Norway total investments in oil and gas activity in 2017, including pipeline transportation, came to Nkr150.95bn (US$17.9bn), which was 8.7% down from the previous year (albeit a much smaller contraction than the 18% decline registered in 2016) acting as a drag on real GDP growth, and negatively affecting employment. The scale back in investment was owing to several factors: many major development projects were finalised, or are close to being finalised; some new projects were postponed owing to uncertainty in the oil industry; and measures were being taken to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs. Investment will continue to decline this year, but we expect it to pick up from 2019 onward. Oil prices have recovered since last year, but will remain broadly flat over the medium term; after averaging US$54.5/barrel in 2017, we forecast that they will reach US$73.5/b this year, and average US$73.6/b in 2018-22.
The long-term trend for oil and gas production is subject to considerable uncertainty. Norway's crude oil output peaked at 3.4m b/d in 2001, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and oil production will decline in the short to medium term. This will be partly offset by a rise in output of natural gas. However, the combined production of oil and gas could rise again beyond 2022 if further large discoveries are made.
At end-2017, 85 fields were in production, 66 in the North Sea, 17 in the Norwegian Sea and two in the Barents Sea. Five new fields started producing in 2017, with another nine under development at end-2017. The North Sea is estimated to account for around 51% of the total remaining resources. The remaining reserves in the Norwegian and Barents seas are estimated to have 25% of total remaining resources each. Although these can be no more than estimates based on seismic surveys and experience, substantial investment in these areas is expected to flow from the forthcoming licensing rounds and the smaller annual awards in pre-defined areas. At the same time, the government is under pressure from the petroleum industry to open up the area around the Lofoten islands for exploration, although in view of environmental concerns, the development of petroleum resources is politically controversial. In 2013-17 an agreement to prevent impact assessments taking place in the Lofoten islands was reached by the junior centre-right parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-in exchange for external parliamentary support for the right-wing government. This agreement was renewed in early 2018 and will remain in place until the end of the legislature. Both the Liberals and the KrF are aware that the three largest parties in parliament-the Labour Party, the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP)-have the majority needed to approve impact assessments in Lofoten.

Consumer price inflation (national measure) decelerated to 1.9% in 2017, from 3.6% in 2016. In January-July annual inflation picked up, as we had anticipated, reaching an average of 2.3%. In the second half of 2018 higher energy prices and firm wage growth should mean that inflation will remain strong. Risks are on the upside, owing to the potential pass-through of the krone's depreciation in the second half of 2017.
Although core inflation is weak, at 1.3% year on year in January-July (well below the 2% target), we expect it to pick up in the coming months. In 2019-22 inflation should remain stable, at an annual average of 2.1%, underpinned by firm wage growth.

The krone has been appreciating marginally against the euro since early 2018, after it depreciated significantly throughout 2017 owing to the economic upswing in the euro zone. We expect the krone to continue to appreciate against the euro throughout the rest of the year, especially in light of higher global oil prices and an expected tightening of Norges Bank's monetary policy.
In 2019-22 the krone will appreciate both vis-à-vis the euro and the dollar. The central bank will keep a tighter accommodative stance than the European Central Bank throughout 2018-22. The US economy is set to lose momentum in 2019, owing to a business cycle slowdown and the bilateral trade war with China, which should make the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) adopt a more cautious tone. Of note is that movements in the krone will remain closely linked to developments in energy prices. However, given that global oil prices are projected to remain broadly stable in the medium term, global monetary policy stances and the economic outlook will weigh more on currency fluctuations.

Norway's current-account surplus rose to 5.5% of GDP in 2017-a reversal from the shrinking trend recorded in 2015 and 2016 (in 2016 the surplus was near a two-decade low). The current account was boosted mainly by a growing goods surplus, driven by rising domestic demand and higher energy prices. The primary income surplus also contributed positively and should remain substantial, underpinned by the growing GPFG. The structure of the current account will remain broadly unchanged in 2018-22.
A further pick-up in oil prices in 2018, to an average price of US$73.5/barrel, from US$54.4/b last year, means that the trade surplus should rise, propelling the current-account surplus upwards, to 7.4% of GDP. In 2019-22 we expect the surplus to average around 7%.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Norway
Stocks and flows
Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) reached US$24.8bn in 2007, before falling sharply during the global financial crisis, to US$8.6bn in 2009. A recovery thereafter saw inward FDI peak at US$26.9bn in 2012, but it has crashed since then, even turning negative in 2016. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a gradual pick-up in investment throughout the forecast period (2018-22), although inflows are unlikely to return to their highs prior to the crash in oil prices. At the end of 2017 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$236.5bn, equivalent to about 59% of GDP. Norway's stock of inward FDI per head, at US$44,698 in 2017, was above the average of the EU15, slightly higher than the level seen in Sweden, and significantly higher than in Denmark and Finland.
Origin and distribution
Norway's abundant offshore resources mean that a significant share of inward FDI is directed towards the hydrocarbons sector, as well as towards ancillary services such as oil and gas insurance, and onshore infrastructure. Many of the world's major foreign oil and gas companies are involved in developing the sector, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon (all US), BP, BG (both UK), Eni (Italy), RWE Dea (Germany) and Engie (France). According to 2016 data from Statistics Norway (latest available), mining and quarrying account for around 28% of inward FDI-owing to the petroleum sector-with the manufacturing sector accounting for a further 14%, much of which relates to the oil and gas sector. Inward FDI has also been important in the financial and business services sector (banks, insurance and property), which accounts for around 12.6% of the total stock. Based on equity capital, the EU member states account for 75% of Norway's total stock of inward FDI, and the US for a further 7%. The most important sources of FDI within the EU are Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, Denmark and Luxembourg.
Determinants
Offshore investment results from the North Sea awards, a system of government licensing that regulates exploration and petroleum production. The government awards annual licences for the predefined, or mature, areas of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. These differ from the numbered licence rounds held every two years concerning new ("frontier") areas, and have been awarded since 2003. The government is keen for petroleum companies to maximise the exploration potential of previously explored areas. Its reluctance to cut the special tax on petroleum exploration is offset by rules introduced in January 2005 that waive any tax on unsuccessful exploration. Norway's rich resource endowment also compensates for factors that would otherwise inhibit FDI, such as the onerous tax burden, uncompetitive wages, small market size, the high cost of living and high property prices. Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) provides companies established there with the same access to the EU market as those in EU countries. Some exchange-rate risk results from being outside the euro area, with the krone affected by large movements in oil prices and its treatment as a safe-haven currency.
Impact
Foreign investors have made a major contribution to the development of the offshore oil and gas sector, notably by transferring technology and know-how that complements local knowledge and expertise. The "ripple effect" from large discoveries-such as Goliat, Ormen Lange, Skarv and Snohvit-has provided new business opportunities for local companies, created an internationally competitive supplier industry and led to the development of Norway's pioneering subsea technology, which extends the life of existing platforms and facilitates development into new deep-sea areas. Given the high taxation on offshore petroleum production, foreign investors also contribute to Norway's sizeable budget surplus and its sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund Global, which acts as a "nest egg" for future public spending. However, the impact on employment has been relatively limited, as only about 1% of the labour force is involved in offshore activities. Much FDI outside sectors related to the oil and gas industry is through purchases of existing companies rather than the setting up of new companies or facilities. Slow progress on selling government stakes in a number of part publicly owned companies may dampen FDI flows.
Potential
Despite Norway's highly educated and well-trained workforce, and the recent reduction in overall taxation, the country's attraction outside the offshore oil and gas sector will remain limited for foreign investors because of high labour costs. The government attaches priority to the economic development of the High North of Norway, the areas adjacent to the Arctic, offering a number of incentives for businesses, including reduced employer contributions and grants. The main opportunities for foreign investors are in the development of offshore oil and gas resources, and of windpower-the government refers to the region as "Europe's new energy province"-although it also hopes to attract investment into the maritime, seafood, green information technology and healthcare sectors.

Norway's demographics will remain relatively favourable until 2022
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects population growth to decelerate in the coming years, although future immigration levels are subject to considerable uncertainty, and will have an effect on the pace of change. Norway's total population is currently at 5.3m. Population growth exceeded 1% per year in 2007-14, but has since slipped back, to around the 0.85% mark in 2015-17. Immigration growth reached a peak in 2008, up by 11.4% from the previous year, largely explained by the 2004 and 2008 EU enlargements. Since then, immigrant flows have remained considerable, but growth decelerated in 2016-17 as tight immigration policies and border controls were put in place following the 2015 refugee crisis. According to Statistics Norway, as at January 1st 2017 the annual increase in the number of immigrants, and Norwegians born to immigrant parents, had slowed to 35,544, (compared with increases of 43,244 in 2016 and 45,778 in 2015). Last year a total of 58,200 people immigrated to Norway, 8,600 fewer than in 2017. The two groups accounted for 16.8% of the total population, up from 16.3% a year earlier.
In 2016 Syrian immigrants registered the highest growth owing to the refugee crisis. However, Polish immigrants remain the largest group within Norway's immigrant population, at 97,200. The second largest group is Lithuanians (37,600), followed by Swedes (36,300) and Somalis (28,700). During the forecast period (2018-22) population growth is expected to average 0.9%, slightly below the increase of 1% in the historical period. A forecast birth rate of around 12 per 1,000 is fairly high by European standards, but a fertility rate of 1.62 children per woman in 2017 (down from 1.71 in 2016) is below the replacement rate for developed countries, of around 2.1. The fertility rate has been falling since 2009 (when it was 1.98), and with life expectancy continuing to increase, the potential impact on Norway's demographic profile will be an ever-increasing political concern in future decades. We expect a sharp slowdown in the growth of the working-age population, from 0.9% per year in 2012-16 to just 0.6% in 2018-22.
Despite these trends, in the short to medium term Norway's demographic profile is comparatively favourable. In 2017 the share of the population below the age of 15, at 17.8%, was one of the largest in Europe (compared with 14.6% for the EU28). In the short term this should support growth in demand for consumer goods, services and housing. In the longer term the relatively large youth population will help to mitigate the economic impact of population ageing. The share of the population over 67 (the official retirement age) is low by European standards, but is set to increase steadily. Similar to most other developed countries, Norway will face long-term problems caused by the ageing of its population, but these will only really take effect after 2022. Nonetheless, demographic developments have been a major concern for policymakers, and were partly responsible for the creation of the country's sovereign wealth fund (the Government Pension Fund Global) in 1990.
The impact of weakening demographics is exacerbated by a propensity among some workers to take early retirement or to retire on disability benefits. These factors have compounded serious labour shortages in sectors such as healthcare and other public services. Measures to counter these trends are an important part of a programme of fundamental reform of the pension system, the phasing in of which began in January 2011 and will be fully in place by 2025.
Stronger urbanisation trends will demand a response by policymakers
Norway has one of the lowest population densities in western Europe. With a mainland area of 323,758 sq km, the average population density in 2016 (latest available data) was 14 people per sq km, according to the World Bank. However, the population is unevenly distributed, with 50% concentrated in the south-east (in and around Oslo, the capital). In contrast, population levels in the far northern districts, such as Finnmark, are extremely low. The majority of the Norwegian population (80.8%) lives in urban areas, and the increasing urbanisation of the population has been a persistent concern for policymakers in recent years, as the more remote areas have been losing their younger inhabitants to the urban south, despite large transfer payments from richer to poorer areas. Many young people attending university in the south fail to return to their home towns after graduation, and people in vocational training have tended to move to the urbanised south-east, where most skilled jobs are found. These trends are likely to persist in the forecast period and beyond.

Norwegian consumers' purchasing power offsets limited market opportunities
With a population of just over 5m, Norway's economy is relatively small in terms of total GDP, and market opportunities are limited compared with most other OECD countries. Norwegian households enjoy one of the highest levels of GDP per head in the world, but the krone's sharp depreciation since 2014 meant that, in US dollar terms, GDP per head at market exchange rates fell from close to US$100,000 in 2011-14 to US$72,401 in 2015-16. This figure started to recover in 2017, to US$75,484, and should gradually pick up during the forecast period (2018-22), as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some krone appreciation. Even in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), GDP per head is high, at US$61,372 in 2017, making Norway one of the richest countries in western Europe. Moreover, income distribution in Norway is generally even, reflecting high levels of public welfare provision, generous redistributive policies and narrow wage differentials. The OECD gives Norway a Gini coefficient of 25.7% in 2014, the fifth lowest among the OECD countries (a Gini coefficient of zero represents perfect income equality and 100 displays total income inequality). With manual and lower-skilled workers enjoying comparatively high incomes, consumption is spread evenly across the population.
Norway's consumer market is on a par with those of other Nordic countries. Looking at overall (mainland and offshore) GDP, private consumption accounts for a similar share of economic activity in Norway (around 45%) as in Sweden or Denmark. If the importance of Norway's petroleum sector is excluded, private consumption accounted for about 53% of mainland GDP in 2017. Norway experienced a consumer boom in 2004-07, when real private consumption expanded by an average of 5.1% per year, which compares with 2.6% in 2010-16. Growth rates are likely to slow slightly in the forecast period, to an average of around 2% in 2018-22. Nevertheless, consumer spending will remain an important contributor to real GDP growth until 2022, although investment will take the lead. Low unemployment, and low interest rates and inflation, will all help the Norwegian economy as it continues to outpace its European peers. By 2022 GDP per head is forecast to reach US$99,530 at market exchange rates and US$69,160 at PPP.

Living standards will remain among the highest in the world
Norway is a mature economy, and consumers are widely equipped with most household hardware, such as white goods, television sets, home entertainment equipment and personal computers. Mature market growth will be driven by the need to replace durables, but also by technological innovation. The non-food retail market is relatively open to competition, with many small, medium-sized and niche players. Most consumer goods are imported. Few local companies are involved in consumer goods manufacturing, and only a small number of multinational companies has local manufacturing facilities, owing to Norway's high labour costs in this sector. From an employer's perspective, high wages are one of the least attractive features of the Norwegian economy; only Switzerland's workers are paid more, according to estimates. Owing to topographical and climate factors, Norway is a net importer of many agricultural products, especially fruit and vegetables, although a large share of meat is produced domestically. The one exception to this is the seafood sector, in which Norway has established itself as one of the world's largest exporters, especially of farmed fish, such as salmon.
Norwegians tend to spend a higher proportion of their total income on food than people in most other European countries, although we expect that this figure will fall during the forecast period. In part, this will reflect high tariffs and taxes on food products, as well as limited competition within the food retail sector. A higher proportion of spending is directed towards leisure, including hotel stays and restaurants. The standard of living is generally high, with two out of ten households owning more than one car, and a similar proportion owning a second (holiday) home. Among the sociological trends that will have an impact on consumption patterns are a rise in single-person households and the gradual ageing of the population.

The ageing of the population will become an issue from 2020
Initial conditions: Over the past decade, Norway's economic performance has been strong relative to that of most EU countries. Economic growth has been helped by Norway having a rich endowment of natural resources in its offshore oil and gas reserves. Given that only around 48% of expected petroleum resources have been extracted to date, the country will remain a significant producer and a net exporter of crude oil throughout The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term forecast period, to 2050. However, the pace of oil production from the Norwegian continental shelf is expected to slow more significantly from 2019. Stronger growth can also be attributed to rising labour utilisation, as the number of hours worked has increased and absenteeism has been slightly reduced. Although participation rates are already high, one long-term challenge for the government will be to reverse the trend among older workers to take early retirement. To this effect, the pension system is undergoing reform, including by reducing longevity risk through a pension adjustment linked to life expectancy, and will be fully implemented by 2025. Another driver of Norway's economic performance has been productivity growth, in part stemming from greater use of information and communication technology in the production of goods and services. However, the tightness of the labour market could have a dampening effect on productivity growth in the near term, as marginal workers are drawn into the labour market and skills shortages appear in some sectors. Further risk factors are a slower pace of product market reforms in recent years and Norway's comparatively poor record of investing in research and development (R&D), which accounts for about only 2% of GDP, and lifelong learning. Improving the skills and knowledge of the workforce will be vital, given the diminishing opportunities for boosting GDP growth through increased labour utilisation.
Demographic trends: Compared with other OECD countries, Norway's starting position is more favourable in terms of the problems presented by an ageing population. Overall population growth is expected to be maintained for the entire long-term forecast period. Norway's labour force is expected to increase throughout the forecast period, although the rate of growth will decrease from the 2020s. There will be a similar fall-off in the rate of growth of the working-age population, from around 1% in 2000-16 to around 0.5% in 2018-50. As the proportion of those aged 67 or above and the old-age dependency ratio (those 67 and over relative to those aged 15-66) will increase, Norway will have to finance a larger volume of services and transfers to the older age groups relative to its contributions base, unless incentives to remain in the labour force longer are effective (a scenario we consider fairly unlikely, given that participation rates are already among the highest in the world).
Even taking into account the flow of oil revenue, pension liabilities will greatly exceed the expected assets of the entire Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund that was created to ensure that future generations would benefit from the country's oil riches). There is concern that current pension reforms do not go far enough in tackling the problems relating to work incentives and the generous scale of public-sector pensions. The government will need to take further action over the coming decade to avoid a sharply rising tax burden from 2022.
External conditions: As a small country that is highly dependent on open markets and free trade, Norway stands to benefit from its European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which extends the EU's single market to include it. The EU is the world's largest and most integrated regional market, and accounts for the vast majority of Norwegian exports and imports. Set against this, the EU's long-term rate of growth is likely to remain moderate. Another uncertainty over the forecast period concerns Norway's position with respect to the EU. Within the EU, although some progress will be made in further advancing trade in goods and the liberalisation of trade in services, the focus-particularly in the next decade-will be on ensuring that there is no reversal of these policies, and especially on trying to prevent the break-up of the euro zone and on preserving the single market. In this context, the migration crisis in 2015 and the UK's withdrawal from the EU (set to happen in 2019) have the potential to be politically destabilising, and are likely to disrupt the EU's policymaking framework. In a worst-case scenario, a disorderly break-up of the euro zone, combined with the rise of Asian exporters (particularly China), or an extreme policy move by the current US administration could unleash protectionist forces in Europe that could threaten a reversal of the gradual freeing of global trade since the end of the second world war, which would be a serious concern for such a small and open economy.
Norway's efforts to improve market competition have been modest
Institutions and policy trends: Norway has a long democratic history and enjoys stable, democratic and transparent institutions, along with a well-entrenched justice system. Corruption is largely absent from Norwegian political and business life. The prospects for stable growth are enhanced by high levels of benefits and state-funded education, including at tertiary level, which ensures a healthy and well-educated workforce. In the long term, however, the welfare state may not be as well funded as it is currently. Norway favours free enterprise and market competition to a lesser extent than Denmark and Sweden. The state remains a significant player in many sectors, such as telecommunications, banking, energy and the offshore sector, and progress on the government's plan to reduce its stakes in some companies has been slow. Norway also lags behind neighbouring countries in efforts to promote com-petition in major product and labour markets, in part because the country's oil riches provide little incentive for policymakers to enact potentially unpopular structural reforms. Similarly, there is a risk that the existence of the GPFG will mask the need for reforms to the social security system. A pension reform in 2011 improved incentives to work beyond retirement age and cut the link between pension payments and wages; further adjustments are expected in the coming years. However, government projections indicate that the assets of the pension fund will be insufficient to cover the state's liabilities arising from pensions and other demands on the public purse (such as healthcare) in the absence of further reform of both the pension system and the labour market. Measures would have to include further discouragement from taking early retirement or drawing disability benefits. The proportion of the workforce drawing disability benefit in Norway is almost double the average for the OECD. Ensuring the sustainability of Norway's generous welfare state will be an important challenge for future governments.
Long-term growth will depend largely on productivity increases
Long-term performance: As Norway has less scope than most other developed economies for raising its labour force participation rate, its long-term economic prospects will depend on a continued high rate of investment, as well as improvements in productivity, which we expect to rise during the forecast period (at an average rate of 0.5% in 2018-50), having been sluggish for much of the past decade (-0.5% in 2008-17). Long-term economic performance will also depend on how successive governments meet the challenge of structural reform. Given the current large surpluses on the general government budget, it is often easy for policymakers to ignore non-oil budget deficits. A failure to adapt social security and welfare systems to the challenge of population ageing would lead to large fiscal deficits towards the end of the long-term forecast period, which would necessitate a rising tax burden and dampen growth. This would be exacerbated, should oil production decrease markedly, making continued investment in exploration important.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Norway's emissions mainly result from oil and gas production as well as from chemical processes used in aluminium production. Electricity needs, however, are all met through abundant hydropower. The Government Pension Fund Global, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, will play an increasingly large role in environmental policy. In 2016 two new criteria were established by the fund, making it move away from, firstly, companies with unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions and, secondly, companies for which at least 30% of revenue are derived from, or operations based on, thermal coal.
Norway has also provided several electric vehicle (EV) incentives, which have contributed to it having the highest number of EVs per capita in the world. Incentives come from value-added tax (VAT) and registration-tax exemptions, and a reduction in the annual motor vehicle tax, among others. In fact, Norway uses taxes as the main tool in its efforts to become more environmentally friendly. The OECD, in its latest policy recommendations, put forward what more could be done in terms of taxation on the environment front. The recommendations include reducing red-meat production grants, terminating grants for logging roads and cableways and preferential VAT rate for passenger transport, and increasing the usage of grants to finance environmental technology.
Despite solid efforts by successive governments to bolster environmental policy, a limitation in oil-related activities is unlikely. The oil and gas sector is at the core of the Norwegian economy, and the three biggest parties in parliament do not seem ready to make radical changes to it. Only smaller parties like the Liberals and the Christian Democrats will continue to push for more measures to be taken in that direction. Opening up the Arctic for further oil-drilling will continue to be a sensitive issue, but the impact of the smaller, centrist parties and environmental non-governmental organisations will be modest.
Technological developments
Norway's society has been relatively resilient to globalisation-driven changes, in part thanks to the welfare support provided by the state. At the same time, it has been one of the countries that has paid more attention to the impact of the sharing economy. The government created a committee to assess the sharing economy and taxi-market reform, although the latter will take a long time to progress, as the legal framework is still very unfriendly towards companies like Uber. The levels of research and development intensity as a percentage of value added are relatively low, but this mainly due to Norway's industrial structure (and the size of the extraction sector). Adjusting for that R&D intensity would be marginally above the OECD average.
Technological developments in the oil sector have also been significant over the past decades. The innovation in the petroleum sector had spill over effects in other industries such as maritime and renewable energy. The authorities promote research and technology development, through legislation and direct allocations to the Research Council of Norway. PETROMAKS 2 is a research program that funds a wide range of projects, from basic research at the university and research institute level to innovation projects in the private sector. At the start of 2018, there were around 120 active projects in PETROMASKS 2 portfolio-which has a budget of Nkr270m (US$33m) this year. The DEMO2000 programme is smaller in scale but counted with 70 ongoing projects at the start of the year and a budget of Nkr70m.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition is under increasing political pressure amid currency pressure and an IMF bailout (the Fund is unpopular in Argentina), but will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election in October 2019, when Mauricio Macri will seek a second term. However, the opposition will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of Argentina's dominant Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party).
Amid a severe crisis of confidence, the government has doubled down on austerity measures and announced a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended to eliminate the primary fiscal deficit by 2019 and produce a primary fiscal surplus of 1% of GDP in 2020. In combination with recent currency devaluation, which should prompt external sector adjustments, the latest emergency economic package should, in theory, be sufficient to reduce concern over the twin deficits and the inflation problem. It will come at the cost, however, of tipping Argentina into a deeper recession than previously expected, and will be subject to substantial implementation risks amid a strong likelihood of public resistance to ever-deeper austerity.
With public spending set to contract, and high interest rates contributing to much weaker credit demand and availability, The Economist Intelligence Unit's expectation is that GDP will contract in 2018 by 2.2%, with a recovery getting under way in early 2019. Our forecast for recovery in 2019 rests on a number of key assumptions, including a return to normal harvest levels next year; an improvement in sentiment and in conditions for consumers, which will require a sustained decline in inflation; and a positive contribution of net exports to growth, reflecting a combination of import compression and a pick-up in export-related industry in response to much-improved competitiveness.
Argentina's GDP per head remains high by regional comparison. Combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves in 2018-22, and the country jumps 12 places in the global ranking. Policy adjustment is under way as the government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. But in many areas improvements will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2020-22: Continued work to build faith in legal and regulatory frameworks. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2018-19: Proactive, welcoming approach to foreign investment. Attempts to resolve outstanding disputes with creditors.
2020-22: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
2020-22: Possibility that new free-trade agreements are signed with the EU and Canada.
Taxes
2018-19: Temporary generalised export taxes implemented to narrow the fiscal gap. Delays to implementation of tax cuts envisaged in 2017 tax reform.
2020-22: Temporary export taxes eliminated in 2021. Only very gradual cuts elsewhere to reduce tax pressure.
Financing
2018-19: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2020-22: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2018-19: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of unions remains strong.

Infrastructure
2018-19: The Macri administration continues to improve contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes.
2020-22: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Quality of e-commerce business environment is good. Upgrade of 4G capabilities.
2020-22: More progress on increasing scope of e-government as part of process to reduce red tape. Increase in research and development spending as percentage of GDP, but still relatively low compared with more developed markets.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of instability and military regimes. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and failure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of the centre-left government and a deep economic crisis. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanagement drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015. Mr Macri has struggled to restore macroeconomic stability and sharp policy tightening has been required in 2018 amid currency pressures.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house), but in practice the presidency dominates. The 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district each has its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. Macroeconomic adjustments to try to reduce economic distortions are taking place under Mr Macri, but the pace of adjustment has been insufficient to prevent severe currency pressure, and in mid-2018 the government was forced to turn to the IMF for a stand-by lending arrangement involving tighter fiscal targets, but this deal failed to restore market confidence, amid large fiscal and external imbalances. In September 2018 the government was forced to announce steep spending cuts and temporary export tax increases.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate was scheduled fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021, but this schedule of cuts may be pushed back amid fiscal difficulties. A temporary tax on exports of Ps3-4 per dollar of exports is set to last until end-2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions.
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2017 the deficit had widened to 4.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Amid a crisis of confidence in the economy, the president, Mauricio Macri, has committed to an austerity programme that will dominate the remainder of his term of office-and determine his chances of winning a second term in the October 2019 presidential election. Although it includes provisions for social safety-net spending to protect the most vulnerable, the package of budget cuts and tax increases, intended to eliminate the large fiscal gap, will deepen the recession and hit the public hard. Voter disillusionment with the government and the results to date of its austerity measures, in place now for almost three years, is rising. In this context, the potential for social unrest, and potentially severe political instability, in the period leading up to the presidential election will be high.
In the short term, the 2019 budget process will be a key test of political stability and governability. The budget is due to be presented to Congress by September 15th, and must be passed by the time Congress goes into its summer recess in December. The government, which is in a minority in both houses of Congress, must negotiate with the opposition to pass its budget; until this year's crisis, the ruling Cambiemos coalition was extremely successful in negotiating support for its legislative agenda by courting moderate centrist members of Argentina's dominant party, the Peronist party. There are signals that some moderate Peronists, including some influential Peronist governors, might continue to support the government's adjustment programme. But, sensing the government's weakness, the left wing of the Peronist party will be in stark opposition, as will powerful unions, and difficult negotiations seem likely.
In this environment, the government's reform agenda will remain on the back burner for the rest of Mr Macri's first term. Following solid progress on tax, pensions and competition reform in 2017, the structural reform agenda came to a standstill in early 2018. For now, on the benign assumption that Mr Macri is successful in steering the economy through difficult waters and secures a second term of office, The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that later in our forecast period there will be a renewed emphasis on much-needed reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effectiveness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights, which will start to lay the groundwork for more solid long-term growth rates. But this is a benign assumption, and the policy outlook would not be as positive under a new government (which would presumably come from the Peronist party).
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
There are large and growing risks to our benign assumption that Mr Macri will win a second term in October 2019. This forecast is underpinned by an assumption that an economic recovery, driven by the export sector and by a recovery in agriculture from drought, will be well under way in a year's time, and that consumers will be starting to feel the beneficial impact in the form of a shift to positive real wages and employment growth. But Mr Macri's position is a difficult one. Reflecting the challenges faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist party has been able to complete two consecutive terms in office since the 1920s. The emergence of a strong challenger from the Peronist party is therefore likely (although it is as yet unclear who this will be), and the election will be closely fought. The strongest Peronist challenge seems most likely to come from its moderate, pragmatist wing, given recent corruption allegations engulfing the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and high-ranking officials in her government, who dominate the left-wing populist branch of the party. This may actually work against Mr Macri as, in a probable second-round vote, he would face a stiffer contest from a moderate pragmatist, such as the Salta governor, Juan Manuel Urtubey, than from the populist wing of the party, which retains a loyal base of supporters but also has high rejection rates among the wider population.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Mr Macri has made considerable efforts to mend relations with investors and to seek trade and investment commitments from key international partners during his time in office. Although this has not yet produced major foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments or breakthroughs in trade deals, these efforts will at least bear some fruit in the short term in the form of support for the government's adjustment programme. This was in evidence in early September, when the US president, Donald Trump, issued a statement of support for the Macri administration and its IMF deal. But other foreign policy priorities will take a back seat to emergency adjustment measures. An EU-Mercosur free-trade deal, for example, seems increasingly improbable in the short term. The window of opportunity for a deal is unlikely to open again until after Argentina's presidential election in October 2019 (assuming that the new Brazilian government is also keen to move forward on free trade).
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Amid a severe crisis of confidence in a context of tougher external conditions for emerging markets (and a resulting souring in investor appetite towards them), the government has doubled down on austerity measures. Adjustment is centred on a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended to eliminate the primary fiscal deficit by 2019 and produce a primary fiscal surplus of 1% of GDP in 2020. In combination with recent currency devaluation, which should prompt external sector adjustments, the latest emergency economic package should in theory be sufficient to reduce concern over the twin deficits and the high inflation problem. It will come at the cost, however, of tipping Argentina into a deeper recession than previously expected, and will be subject to substantial implementation risks amid a strong likelihood of public resistance to ever deeper austerity.
Adjustment will take place under the auspices of an IMF lending deal, which will provide the financial breathing space that the government needs this year and next (after which we currently assume that external financing conditions for Argentina will improve). A US$50bn three-year stand-by arrangement (SBA) was inked in June, but amid a collapse of domestic confidence, triggered by weak economic data in August, the government has gone back to the Fund seeking adjustments to targets and the disbursement schedule in a revised deal; a more frontloaded disbursement of funds is likely.
We expect that programme targets will, on the whole, be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macroeconomic stability over time. The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and reflect the possibility that a loss of confidence in the Macri administration and the economic outlook will feed into further market volatility. This would not only complicate the adjustment process, but also threaten our assumption that Mr Macri will secure a second term, raising questions as to the future direction of economic policy.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In early September, in an effort to assuage concerns over the government's ability to steer a course towards economic normalisation, Mr Macri announced a series of austerity measures that sounded a death knell for gradualist adjustment. The plan centres on a deep fiscal adjustment, to accompany the ongoing currency and external sector adjustment, split fairly evenly between spending cuts and tax increases. In total, to get to primary fiscal balance in 2019, the government is planning 1.4% of GDP in spending cuts (centred on capital spending and economic subsidies) and 1.3% of GDP in increased revenue from temporary, across-the-board export taxes. The latter will last through 2020 and will be taxed at a rate of Ps4 (around 10 US cents at the current exchange rate) for each dollar of revenue for primary and services exporters, and Ps3 per dollar for other exports.
In our view, the plan introduces realistic measures that are sufficient, in theory, to allow the government to meet its targets, and our forecasts assume a return to balance in line with the government's targets. However, there are substantial risks to our forecasts, as the plan's success will depend to a large extent on restoring domestic confidence, and on the government's commitment and capacity to push through difficult measures such as continued subsidy cuts (which imply higher utilities tariffs for consumers). The government has included provisions in the fiscal programme for increased social safety-net spending for pensioners and recipients of conditional cash transfers, and this could help to secure the programme's political acceptance. Even so, the government will have a tough task ahead of it, particularly in 2019, an election year, and the risk of policy setbacks will be high.
A major factor in the government's new plan for rapid fiscal adjustment is the deterioration of public debt indicators. Reflecting the impact of this year's 50% currency depreciation, we now expect public debt/GDP to rise sharply, from 57% of GDP last year to above 90% of GDP this year, the highest level among Latin America's major economies by some distance. This will serve to dampen investor confidence for an extended period and will necessitate several years of austerity to reverse. However, around half of the public debt is intra-government debt held by the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) and the social security agency. Excluding this debt, the public-sector debt ratio will be closer to 50% in 2018.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
After a hike in the policy rate to 60% at the height of the crisis in late August, monetary policy will be tight throughout the forecast period, although we assume that there will be a steady (but very slow) loosening of extraordinarily tight policy from 2019. Tight monetary policy is having an impact, as is evident in the deceleration of growth in the monetary aggregates (which the central bank has recently begun monitoring more closely as a complement to the policy rate), and we do expect the BCRA to begin to unwind its dramatic rate rise in the next few months. This process will be complicated, however, by weak confidence in the nascent inflation-targeting regime, which means that inflation expectations are not well anchored and pass-through from currency depreciation into consumer prices is high. In this environment, real rates will need to remain high throughout much of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
We have made substantial downward revisions to our forecasts for real GDP for this year and next, on the assumption that sharp currency weakening and fiscal tightening will deepen and lengthen this year's recession. On this basis, we now expect a deep contraction of GDP of 2.2% in 2018, and only very weak growth in 2019 of 0.3% (although in sequential terms, we expect growth to be gathering pace from early 2019).
The available activity data for the second quarter are dire; the monthly economic activity index shows a rapid shift from moderate growth (of 0.6% quarter on quarter) in the first quarter to a steep decline (of 3.9% quarter on quarter). The initial driver of this decline was the severest drought in several decades, but the contraction has become more broad-based amid a collapse of consumer and business confidence and a loss of consumer purchasing power. With public spending set to contract, and high interest rates contributing to much weaker credit demand and availability, our expectation is that GDP will contract in sequential terms for three consecutive quarters, with a recovery getting under way in early 2019.
Our forecast for recovery in 2019 rests on a number of key assumptions, including a return to normal harvest levels next year; an improvement in sentiment and in conditions for consumers, which will require a sustained decline in inflation; and a positive contribution of net exports to growth, reflecting a combination of import compression and a pick-up in export-related industry in response to much-improved competitiveness.
For both 2018 and 2019 there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty attached to our forecasts. There is, on the one hand, a not-insubstantial risk that policy tightening on top of drought could tip Argentina into a deeper, longer recession extending out to 2019. But, on the other hand, activity could rebound slightly more quickly than we currently have pencilled into our forecasts in 2019 if real currency adjustment proves a more rapid than expected spur to export manufacturing activity.
Our forecasts for the second part of the forecast period (2020-22) assume a return to moderate growth of over 3% per year. We recognise that such a prompt turnaround represents a benign forecast that is dependent on a successful economic adjustment that finally addresses the problem of the twin deficits and persistently high inflation. We do believe that this adjustment process is achievable; we also believe that the medium-term prospects for energy, mining, export-oriented industry and agriculture are good. But there are clear risks to these forecasts depending on developments in coming months.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Recent currency movements will feed through into consumer prices, and inflationary pressures will be compounded by the continued need to reduce the fiscal burden of energy subsidies (which implies an increase in utilities tariffs). Our forecasts assume a sharp spike in prices in late 2018 that pushes inflation over 40% by year-end, followed by a period of very gradual disinflation. The latter will, however, be complicated by continued increases in gas and electricity prices, and by unanchored inflation expectations, which will produce substantial exchange-rate pass-through. Even so, assuming that macro-economic policy remains tight under the auspices of the IMF deal, domestic demand remains subdued, and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers, we continue to expect gradual disinflation in the medium term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The sharp currency slide of late August has left the peso undervalued in real terms. Based on our expectations of a temporary spike in inflation above 40%, and a further modest depreciation of the peso to around Ps42:US$1, the peso will be more than 15% weaker at end-2018 than its long-run (20-year) average in real, trade-weighted terms. This suggests that in the short term the peso does not have much further left to fall, although we expect some moderate, more steady nominal peso depreciation throughout the forecast period to more or less keep pace with inflation trends. Late in the forecast period, on our assumption of a shift to current-account surpluses, a modest recovery in portfolio flows and a rebuilding of reserves, there may be some renewed real appreciation pressures. At present, however, risks are geared towards periods of further weakness in response, for example, to political instability or to evidence that inflation is not subsiding as expected in 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The dramatic currency adjustment of August has reversed the accumulated peso overvaluation of recent years, and these sharp external competitiveness gains should produce a faster adjustment of the current-account deficit than we had previously been forecasting. We now project that the deficit will more than halve in 2019, to under 2% of GDP, on the back of a moderate expansion of goods and services exports and steep import compression amid recession. Assuming that investment in a more competitive industrial sector continues, and that Argentina becomes less dependent on oil imports in the medium term as energy sector investments start to come on stream, we now project that the current account will shift into surplus late in the forecast period.
Pressure on the foreign reserves will persist in the short term, but reserves coverage will be supported by fresh inflows of funds from the IMF under the SBA. As adjustment in the current account gathers pace, and assuming moderate inflows of FDI averaging 2.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and an eventual, albeit gradual, recovery of portfolio flows, a rebuilding of foreign reserves is likely.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. The government is vulnerable to further defections, and there is a significant risk of an early election (it is not due until October 2019). The centre-right New Democracy (ND) is likely to win the most seats and form a coalition government.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests over labour market reforms, pension cuts, privatisation, and tax and social security increases are likely to continue as the government strives to meet the ambitious annual primary surplus budget target of 3.5% of GDP until 2022, as agreed with Greece's euro zone creditors.
Greece faces its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. How the economy performs during the post-programme transition will determine whether Greece will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of it leaving the zone by 2022 at more than 50%, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. We expect that public debt will still exceed 170% of GDP in 2022.
Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments for almost two years after it exits the bail-out programme this month. However, the challenges posed by the high public debt burden and a poor growth outlook mean that Grexit will remain a significant risk in the medium and long term.
We forecast that annual average inflation will edge down from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.8% in 2018, before accelerating to an annual average of 1.5% in 2019-22, reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These trends will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-22.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our 2018-22 forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment and as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The country's privatisation agency, under new management, gains momentum. Deals start to make progress.
2020-22: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2020-22: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. The risk of Greece leaving the euro area and reintroducing exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade will remain high after exit from the European Stability Mechanism.
2020-22: There is more than a 50% risk of Greece leaving the euro zone if growth continues to disappoint.
Taxes
2018-19: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2020-22: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of the tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2018-19: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) painfully slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2020-22: Lending hampered by need to make provisions for still high NPL portfolios. Greece's main banks sell more of their overseas subsidiaries. Some form of normalcy in sight towards the end of this period.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2020-22: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2020-22: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2020-22: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme. In 2012 public debt held by the private sector was restructured. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn (US$31.5bn) and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.4bn, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Following the defection of two members of the AE, in protest at the agreement on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute, the government's majority has been reduced to just two seats. Mr Tsipras will aim to see through his parliamentary term, which ends in October 2019, but there is a significant risk of a pre-term election.
The government has been badly damaged by the authorities' handling of the emergency caused by wildfires in the Attica region in July, which resulted in the deaths of more than 90 people. The alternate minister for civil protection, Nikos Toskas, resigned soon afterwards, but the electorate will hold the entire government to account for the death toll from the disaster. Coming in the wake of more than 20 deaths caused by flash floods west of Athens, the capital, in November 2017, the wildfires have heightened public anger over the shortcomings of the government and the public administration.
In August 2015 the government tied its acceptance of bail-out reforms under a European Stability Mechanism (ESM, an inter-governmental assistance fund for countries in the euro zone) programme to the objective of receiving debt relief from its official creditors. Three years later, on August 20th, the government exited the programme with minimal debt relief, having lost much popular support along the way. Mr Tsipras aims to revive his party's political fortunes now that Greece has completed the programme, and will be hoping that economic growth will gain momentum over the coming year; however, The Economist Intelligence Unit is sceptical about his chances of doing so.
Tensions within the government coalition will persist, including over the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. The AE has said that it will oppose the name agreement when it is brought before parliament, and the senior ruling party, Syriza, may struggle to obtain the required majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has been more than 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
On June 12th Mr Tsipras and Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia), announced their agreement to change that country's constitutional name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia). The two leaders attended a ceremony on June 17th in the Prespes district of northern Greece, at which their respective foreign ministers, Nikos Kotzias and Nikola Dimitrov, signed an agreement on the change. The breakthrough is only the first step towards a resolution of the name dispute, and-given public opposition in both countries-the agreement may fail to come into effect. Macedonia's parliament has approved the agreement, which will be put to a referendum on September 30th, before being presented in the Greek parliament next year.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have risen recently. The risk of military confrontation is high, particularly in the Aegean Sea, but both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in mid-August of two Greek soldiers arrested for alleged espionage in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has helped to ease tensions, which were threatening to boil over.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
On August 20th Greece emerged from an eight-year period (2010-18) during which it received a total of EUR274bn in official financial support from European creditors and the IMF (EUR32.1bn from the IMF) and was subject to three economic adjustment programmes. Repaying the country's outstanding public debt, which totalled EUR344bn (about 180% of GDP) at the end of March, means that future Greek governments will be subject to huge policy constraints. Fiscal austerity and policy conditionality will remain in place for the next five years and beyond.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup, Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released on August 6th. Of this, EUR3.3bn will be used to pay down the more expensive IMF debt, and the balance will form part of a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR24.1bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn) and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets relating to official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries-estimated at about EUR5bn.
Greece, in return, has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in the 2018-22 forecast period and 2.2% of GDP thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after August it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term, through to early 2020. However, in the medium and long term the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will pose a significant risk in the medium and long term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2017 the budget surplus was equivalent to 0.8% of GDP and the primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) exceeded the bail-out programme target of 1.75% of GDP, coming in at 4% of GDP. We expect a minimal budget deficit in 2018 (0.2% of GDP), but we do not expect Greece to meet its annual primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP this year, or in 2019-22. We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually during this period, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR317.4bn, or 179.1% of GDP, in 2017. Government debt is now almost entirely owed to official creditors. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain above 170% in 2018-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017 and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The ECB's view of the outlook improved during 2017 and, although economic activity in the euro zone softened in early 2018, the bank is now more upbeat. We expect monthly asset purchases under the QE programme to conclude at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of growing domestic price pressure in some parts of the zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge in 2019-20. We expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter, government consumption by almost a quarter, household consumption by a fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external develop-ments, as shown by a marked slowdown in activity in quarterly terms in the second half of last year. We forecast that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to an average of 1.9% per year in 2018-22. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism perform-ance. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Seasonally and calendar-day-adjusted real GDP expanded by 0.8% quarter on quarter and by 2.3% year on year in January-March. Some high-frequency data-notably for tourism-are showing signs of strength, and sentiment has improved, especially in the services sector. We forecast real GDP growth of 2% in 2018. This remains a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. Moreover, the recent wildfires may damage the tourism sector, and external developments (notably the threat of a global trade war) are a cause for concern. We expect a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-22, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
A welcome development in 2017 was a sharp acceleration in fixed investment growth, albeit from a low base. We expect the momentum to continue in 2018 and beyond, with fixed investment growth averaging 5% per year in 2018-22. However, underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about the country's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 5.2% in 2018-22.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs over the next five years and beyond will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of Greece leaving the zone by 2022 as higher than 50%, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and a severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then grow rapidly, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus. Growth rates under this scenario would be faster than those in our medium-term forecast. We have not incorporated Grexit into our forecast numbers.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
After stagnating in 2016, Greece's seasonally adjusted EU harmonised index of consumer prices rose by 1.1% year on year in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, notably in the fourth quarter. Inflation dipped sharply at the start of 2018, rising by just 0.3% year on year in the first quarter, before accelerating since then. In the first seven months of the year inflation on the EU harmonised measure rose by an average of 0.5%. Economic growth is picking up, but significant slack remains in the labour market and domestic demand is subdued. Despite rising global commodity prices and increased tourism, we expect annual inflation to edge down this year, to an average of 0.8%. We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.5% per year on average in 2019-22 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the start of February but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June, July and early August. The euro could come under further pressure from political risk in Italy, and also from US monetary tightening. Nonetheless, we expect a broad stabilisation, with an average exchange rate of US$1.20:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large regional current-account surplus, while the business-cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the dollar in 2020. Thereafter, we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 0.8% of GDP in 2017, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We forecast widening deficits in 2018-22 as import prices rise and import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, but these will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.
