Abstract: High government expenditure ahead of the elections supports growth but hampers fiscal consolidation efforts. 2027-29: GDP grows at an average annual rate of 5.8% in 2027-29, below its pre-pandemic (2015-19) trend of 6.5%, while broad macroeconomic stability is maintained. Despite a relatively low level of GDP per head compared to ASEAN peers, favourable demographics and resilient economic growth spurs expansion of the retail sector. 2027-29: Rapid wage growth could be destabilising in the early part of the forecast period, owing to the acute political pressure for substantial minimum wage rises in the aftermath of the global cost-of-living crisis.

Full text: The political environment
2025-26: The incumbent administration headed by the president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, retains solid support in the Senate and House of Representatives following the mid-term elections held in May 2025.
2027-29: Tensions within the ruling coalition present challenges for the government in passing substantive legislation.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: High government expenditure ahead of the elections supports growth but hampers fiscal consolidation efforts.
2027-29: GDP grows at an average annual rate of 5.8% in 2027-29, below its pre-pandemic (2015-19) trend of 6.5%, while broad macroeconomic stability is maintained.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Despite a relatively low level of GDP per head compared to ASEAN peers, favourable demographics and resilient economic growth spurs expansion of the retail sector.
2027-29: Policies aimed at market liberalisation lead to greater participation of foreign businesses in retail sectors.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The Electronic Business One-Stop Shop system (eBOSS) is rolled out further by more local government units, but progress remains highly uneven and slow.
2027-29: State-owned and politically connected family-run conglomerates continue to play a big role at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: The economy starts to see the benefits of 100% foreign ownership in railways, airports, expressways and telecommunications. The 13th Foreign Investment Negative List is published.
2027-29: Foreign direct investment remains low compared to the country's regional peers, owing to slow progress on the liberalisation of investment restrictions via constitutional reforms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: Negotiations on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership gain momentum, and trade barriers towards the region are lowered in line with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership's provisions.
2027-29: Talks for a free-trade agreement with the EU reach the final stages, before a change in government.
Taxes
2025-26: A new value-added tax on digital services is introduced, as well as an excise tax on single-use plastics. Corporate and personal-income tax rates remain unchanged. The Strategic Investment Priority Plan is published.
2027-29: The administration takes steps to improve compliance and enforce tax evasion laws more strongly. Corporate tax rates will remain high compared to ASEAN peers, despite the recent reforms.
Financing
2025-26: The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank) resumes its push for the consolidation of small and rural banks to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the weak financial sector, while the structural reduction in high reserve requirements resumes.

The labour market
2025-26: The upward pressure on minimum wage rates remains acute, owing to the cost-of-living crisis in 2022-23.
2027-29: A "brain drain" remains a major constraint to business expansion. Greater demand for skilled engineers and construction workers for infrastructure projects elevates the likelihood of wage inflation in this industry.
Infrastructure
2025-26: The Cavite-Laguna Expressway project is completed and work begins for the Southern Access Link Expressway.
2027-29: The administration continues to push for private investment in infrastructure development, while financing via the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund gains momentum. The New Manila International Airport begins construction.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Policies will be enacted to encourage the use of mobile payment systems. The rollout of 5G services progresses.
2027-29: Internet broadband infrastructure becomes more reliable in the capital, Manila, and is extended to rural areas. Use of the eGovPH platform for public services becomes more widespread.

Business environment rankings Overview
As the Philippines has a large and fast-growing market and has seen a broad-based improvement in its labour market, its score will improve to 6.16 in our forecast period, from 5.73 in 2020-24. The likely relaxation of foreign direct investment laws and improved rules on taxation will also help. Despite improving scores, faster improvements among peer economies, however, will mean that the country's global rank will fall by two positions to 57th. Nevertheless, its regional ranking will improve slightly by one place to 12th place.
Strengths
Foreign trade and liberal exchange controls will remain the country's strong points. The Philippines is more deeply integrated with the regional economy, after it entered the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in mid-2023. The 2021 Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act will help to improve ease-of-doing business, and the Marcos administration has helped to boost compliance.
Weaknesses
Long-standing problems with the country's infrastructure will remain a big drag on the overall score, as well as sub-optimal policy towards private enterprise and competition, owing to the influence of large, monopolistic and politically influential family-run conglomerates. Poor government effectiveness will remain another major structural weak point.
What to watch
- The anticipated return of the Marcos administration in the upcoming midterm elections scheduled in May 2025 will ensure policy continuity, boding well for businesses.
- A renewed commitment to free-trade agreements (FTAs) will support positive changes to the score on foreign trade and payments. We expect that the Philippines will seek and complete membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and establish an FTA with the EU in 2025-29.
- Rapid wage growth could be destabilising in the early part of the forecast period, owing to the acute political pressure for substantial minimum wage rises in the aftermath of the global cost-of-living crisis.

Full text: Overview
Owing to improvements in language skills, workforce health and the cost of living, Brazil's labour market will strengthen in our forecast period. Structural improvements have helped the labour force participation rate to increase and unemployment to reach its lowest point in almost a decade. However, many countries will also improve as the pandemic aftermath recedes into the past. As a result, Brazil's global ranking falls by nine places (surpassing the likes of Spain, Russia, China and South Korea), but it remains sixth out of the 12 geographies in Latin America.
Strengths
The unemployment rate had fallen to 7.4% as at end-2023—the lowest since 2015. Prospects for growth in manufacturing and infrastructure will lift demand for skilled labour and better-paid jobs, which will make the labour market more dynamic and vibrant over 2024-28. Although participation among the young population (16-25 years old) is low, this is mostly because a greater proportion of that group now spends more time in higher education and training. This will translate into better language and technical skills in the long term, potentially raising upside risks beyond our 2024-28 forecast horizon.
Weaknesses
Although wages are fairly low, the overall cost of labour for employers is high, as social security obligations and labour benefits add up to one-third of a worker's salary onto the actual cost of employment. Moreover, labour regulations are often subject to political whims, which can be volatile, generating uncertainty around the stability of labour rules and contracts.
What to watch- Although the Lula government has criticised liberalising labour reforms that were introduced in 2017 under a former president, Michel Temer (2016-18), the current right-leaning Congress would block any attempts to roll these back in any significant way. Nevertheless, the government is likely to pass some piecemeal measures to strengthen contractual arrangements for workers in expanding informal sectors (such as drivers for ride-sharing mobile applications) to give them similar benefits to formal sector workers.
- Owing to high labour costs, Congress has once more extended a payroll tax relief programme for 17 labour-intensive sectors to 2027. First introduced in 2011, the tax relief has been extended repeatedly, but the Lula government is adamant that it wants to abolish the programme, claiming that it has drained pension revenue without creating more and better jobs. In parallel, the government will resume proposals to permanently reduce the cost of labour in all sectors, while reducing the burden of payroll tax and increasing taxation on corporate income and profits to lift revenue and narrow the fiscal gap. We assume that some of these measures will materialise, enhancing the country's competitiveness and benefiting labour-intensive sectors such as services, construction and retail.

Policy towards foreign investment Overview
Brazil's score for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged in 2024-28, but the country slips down the global and regional rankings as countries including the UAE, Thailand and Argentina improve. Investor protection is the weakest indicator in the category, owing to the heavy hand of the state in the economy. Still, openness to foreign investors, low expropriation risk and limited government favouritism mean that Brazil will remain a major destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) in our forecast period.
Strengths
Brazil's large market size and diversified economy, combined with major changes (such as the tax simplification reform), will attract investor interest in areas such as infrastructure, agribusiness and green energy. The global energy transition offers opportunities for Brazil, particularly as the country has reserves of the critical minerals necessary for green technologies and could become a major producer of green hydrogen. Brazil also stands to benefit from its reputation for being a safe haven from geopolitical risks.
Weaknesses
Lula's non-aligned foreign policy has become a sticking point with Western powers, as it signals that his Brazil will be a less reliable partner than previously expected. Brazil's neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict has weighed on the country's relations with the West, spooking some investors.
What to watch- Lula's efforts to put Brazil on the global stage are increasing the country's visibility, especially on issues involving ESG policies. Brazil has some of the world's largest deposits of the critical minerals that are essential for the global energy transition. It also has the potential to become a major producer of green hydrogen, owing to its vast water resources and its largely renewables-based energy matrix. However, significant investment is needed to unlock Brazil's growth potential in these sectors.
- Opportunities for foreign capital in sectors such as infrastructure, logistics and energy will grow as tax rules and bureaucracy are streamlined. At end-2023 the government exempted all foreign investors who hold shares in participation investment funds (FIPs, local private-equity funds) from income taxes; previously the tax break was only available to foreign investors who held up to 40% of the shares of a given FIP. Moreover, in April 2024 the government launched the Eco Invest Brazil programme, which seeks to promote and attract foreign investment into climate-change related projects, for example by offering protections against exchange risks and volatility.

Financing Overview
Brazil performs well in the financing category owing to the strength of its banking sector, few financial distortions, solid financial regulations and good capital-market access for foreigners. However, there is room for improvement in terms of stockmarket capitalisation and access to investment finance. The country's financing score remains unchanged in 2024-28, but its global rank drops by 12 spots as other countries including Qatar, Hungary and South Korea improve. Brazil remains a top performer in our regional ranking, second only to Chile.
Strengths
After growing steadily since 2016, the boost that private capital markets received in 2020-21 from record-low pandemic-era interest rates solidified their standing, enabling growth even as monetary policy tightened in 2021-22. The BCB embarked on a monetary-easing cycle in August 2023, taking the Selic policy rate from a peak of 13.75% to 10.5% as at mid-June. We expect the BCB to trim the policy rate to 10% by end-2024. Financial conditions will ease as interest rates come down, reducing the overall cost of capital and credit and encouraging private-sector investment.
Weaknesses
Fiscal constraints and high levels of household indebtedness will dampen the extent to which direct public lending can sustain growth. Although public lending generally contributes to credit and economic growth in a competitive environment, subsidised interest rates as offered by state banks distort the credit market and generate inefficiencies.
What to watch- In February 2024 the monetary authorities changed the regulations for several tax-exempt private debt securities in the agricultural and real-estate sectors, such that corporate issuers must be directly involved in one of those sectors. The change closes a loophole that enabled companies outside those sectors to issue these incentivised securities. We believe that investors will rebalance their portfolios within capital markets, and that movements to other asset classes are unlikely. Offerings of those popular instruments will diminish, straining liquidity, but other tax-exempt securities, especially those with inflation protections, will remain attractive amid falling nominal interest rates.
- In April 2024 the government launched the Acredita programme, which provides microcredit lines to low-income households and small businesses at below-market rates and with facilitated debt-renegotiation mechanisms. The programme aims to draw participation from public and private banks alike, as the federal government will guarantee the subsidised loans. The programme also expands the role of the Empresa Gestora de Ativo (a state company that manages the federal government's real-estate assets) to act as an asset manager to securitise real-estate portfolios owned by private banks. This goal of this change is to boost housing credit by freeing up private banks' balance sheets for new real-estate financing. As government entities will absorb much of the risk, we believe that private banks will be encouraged to participate, which will mitigate risks of market distortions and inefficiencies.

Taxes Overview
Brazil's complex tax regime is a heavy burden on its business environment; its score in this category is one of its weakest. The tax simplification reform approved in late 2023 has helped to improve Brazil's score in 2024-28, lifting its global ranking by nine spots (surpassing countries including Italy, Nigeria and Algeria) and its regional ranking by three positions (overtaking Colombia and Dominican Republic and drawing level with Mexico). However, implementing legislation has yet to be finalised and passed, and if Congress or business lobbies skew the reform in their favour, there is a high risk that the benefits (which will become more apparent beyond our forecast period) will be less pronounced than we expect.
Strengths
The tax simplification reform seeks to combine five different taxes into two value-added tax (VAT) levies. Although the intention is that the reform will be revenue-neutral, the government believes that it will actually boost tax revenue by lifting economic growth, as the elimination of red tape will incentivise entrepreneurship and investments. We assume that some of these benefits will materialise, but likely tweaks by Congress and business interest groups suggest that the gains will be muted.
Weaknesses
Brazil currently has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world. With a tax burden of about 33% of GDP in 2023, Brazil is on a par with the advanced economies of the OECD despite its emerging-market status. A wide array of sectoral benefits and tax exemptions, coupled with indirect taxation levied on goods and services (about 45% in Brazil compared with the OECD average of 32% of total taxes), ultimately pushes up the cost of business operations and weighs on Brazil's competitiveness.
What to watch- In April 2024 the Lula administration presented a proposal to regulate the new dual-VAT regime, including the base VAT rate (estimated currently at 26.5%, compared with 27.5% previously), the items that will receive preferential and exempted status, and revenue distribution across government levels (federal, state and municipal). The government hopes to hold a vote by July, but we do not expect it to materialise before end-2024, or possibly early 2025. Negotiations with Congress, state and municipal governments, and business sectors will be arduous; municipal elections in October will also disrupt the legislative calendar. Lula will need to stand his ground to prevent multiple interest groups from distorting the reform, which raises the risks that VAT could rise even higher (at 26.5%, it is already among the world's highest) and that the bill's simplifying objective could be undermined.
- The government intends to redesign the income tax regime to make it more progressive, pro-investment and reliant on individuals rather than on corporations. We believe that the reform is unlikely to pass owing to resistance from legislators, especially if it ultimately increases the tax burden on the middle class or lifts the overall tax burden.
- The Lula administration will continue its efforts to close tax loopholes to recover revenue as part of its strategy to improve the fiscal position. However, efforts will encounter increasing resistance from interest groups as the 2026 general election approaches.

Technological readiness Overview
There were notable regulatory improvements in 2019-23, such as the launch of the national Internet of Things plan in 2019 and a 5G network auction in 2021. Progress will slow in 2024-28, but Brazil will still improve by one position globally (surpassing Russia) and will remain in the middle by regional standards. Brazil performs well in terms of patent applications, scope of e-government, internet use and spending on research and development (R&D), despite the country's weak mobile penetration.
Strengths
Brazil has been at the forefront of providing digital government services (e-government) and is still making progress. Pix, a digital payment system, gained popularity quickly after its introduction in November 2020, and 99% of Brazilian adults have now registered. The BCB is working on its own digital currency (expected to launch by end-2024), aims to complement Pix and wants to promote financial and digital inclusion.
Weaknesses
Digital inclusion is still a challenge. About 81% of the population has internet access, but coverage among the rural population is lower, at 73%, and is at just 61% among low-income households. High-speed broadband penetration is weak, with just 22.5 accesses per 100,000 population as at January 2024. Mobile subscriptions are also low; China, Ghana and Paraguay all have higher densities than Brazil. Low penetration contributes to Brazil's middling quality of e-commerce business environment, cyber-security preparedness and research infrastructure, which weakens the country's technological readiness score.
What to watch- The BCB aims to introduce its own central bank digital currency, the Drex, by end-2024. The Drex will complement the circulation of traditional money and promises to reduce operational costs, increase financial and digital inclusion and make wholesale and retail transactions more secure. Although the Drex pilot programme is in its final stages, we expect the launch to be delayed until early 2025, given that regulatory agencies still need to outline the new legal framework for the digital currency and its infrastructure.
- Congress is currently discussing a bill to tighten regulation on social media with the aim of curbing the spread of fake news and hate speech on digital platforms. The upper house approved the bill in 2020, but it has stalled in the lower house. The president of the lower house, Arthur Lira, has suggested that the bill be discussed by a specialised congressional committee, which indicates that it will not advance in the near term.
- Inspired by the European Digital Markets Act, a digital markets regulation bill seeks to set rules for the organisation and operation of digital platforms by creating an antitrust framework with oversight from Anatel. The rules aim to combat unfair practices and limit the market concentration of large technology companies. However, the bill has been stuck in the lower house since 2022, owing to concerns that it could stifle innovation. We think that it is unlikely to move forward in the current term, but the Congress that takes office in 2026 could advance the bill in the second half of our forecast period.

Business environment rankings Overview
Brazil's overall business environment score improves in EIU's five-year outlook period, keeping the country in the middle of our regional ranking. However, Brazil falls in our global ranking as countries such as South Africa and Vietnam make greater advancements. Greater market opportunities and taxes strengthen Brazil's score, but rising government debt is weakening the macroeconomic environment. Even though a new fiscal framework is in place, the state-led development strategy of the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), will discourage fiscal discipline.
Strengths
Brazil performs well in foreign trade and exchange controls, policy towards foreign investment and financing. The country will continue to attract investment owing to its large market, its diversified economy, its deep domestic capital markets and its role in the global green energy transition.
Weaknesses
Political effectiveness remains a weak spot, owing to an inefficient legal system, corruption and crime. Brazil's performance in the taxes and infrastructure categories is also lacklustre but should improve. Fiscal constraints and mismanagement will hinder infrastructure development.
What to watch- The government presented the main complementary bill to regulate its tax simplification reform (passed in late 2023) in April. The core text upholds the reform's simplifying spirit, but Congress and businesses are likely to skew the bill in their interests. Changes to the tax code are likely to come in over 2027-33.
- We assume that Lula will win a fourth term at the October 2026 general election, but there is a risk that a right-wing government will return to power. The Superior Electoral Court has made the former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), ineligible for misuse of political influence, but he could transfer his support to another candidate, sustaining risks of a change in government.

Macroeconomic environment Overview
Brazil's macroeconomic environment benefits from price stability, a favourable external balance and solid institutions, but a weak fiscal account weighs it down. Consecutive and wide fiscal deficits, inefficient spending and strained revenue growth will lift Brazil's already-high public debt in our 2024-28 forecast period, weakening the macroeconomic environment score. Brazil falls by seven places in our global ranking (surpassed by the likes of Greece, Colombia and Angola) and drops by one spot in our regional ranking (outperformed by Dominican Republic). Although a promising fiscal framework became law in 2023, adjustments made in April 2024 will sustain concerns about the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation.
Strengths
Brazil's large market, which we expect to reach US$2.7trn by 2028, will continue to attract investors. The country's structural trade surplus, driven by agricultural exports, will benefit further from strong oil production over the medium and long term, strengthening the external balance. A monetary-easing cycle in the US, which we expect to start in September 2024, will support the exchange rate and bolster asset prices.
Weaknesses
A heavy public-debt burden and fiscal imbalances will sustain macroeconomic risks throughout our forecast period. The Lula administration's expansionary fiscal and credit policies will further feed fiscal concerns, exerting upward pressure on Brazil's risk-premiums.
What to watch- In the 2025 budget proposal, presented in April 2024, the government relaxed its primary fiscal targets and is now aiming to reach a primary surplus of 1% of GDP by 2028 (from 2026 previously). We think that even the revised target is unattainable, as mandatory spending items—such as pensions, some social assistance programmes and healthcare expenses—will become increasingly costly and because there is little political will from the Lula administration to cut spending in other areas. Missed fiscal targets will prompt additional adjustments to the fiscal framework, hurting its credibility over time.
- The term of the current governor of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank), Roberto Campos Neto, expires at end-2024, which means that Lula will nominate a new governor to serve in 2025-28. As Lula criticised Mr Campos Neto for being too cautious with the current monetary-easing cycle (it started later and proceeded more slowly than Lula wanted), the next BCB governor will probably have a more dovish orientation ahead of the 2026 election, meaning that inflation control is likely to be looser. There is a risk that the inflation target (currently at 3%) will rise, leaving inflation expectations unanchored, but this is not our current baseline forecast. We do not expect Lula to undermine the BCB's independence or to interfere with the existing floating exchange-rate regime.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
Brazil boasts strong private-property protections, free competition and few price controls, keeping the country second-best in the region for this category, behind Chile. However, Brazil sinks towards the middle of our global ranking, as improving countries such as Romania and Argentina leapfrog stagnant Brazil. Lula and the PT's preference for state-led development policies reduces prospects for privatisation and raises the likelihood that regulatory agencies will gain more power and that intervention in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will increase. However, Lula will continue to seek public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure projects and to expand Brazil's footprint in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space, which will create opportunities for investors.
Strengths
The right-leaning Congress will prevent Lula from expanding the role of the state in the market excessively; for example, it will block any attempts to roll back privatisations that took place under past administrations, as Lula suggested that he would seek to do during his election campaign and early in his term. Brazil's abundant water resources, renewables-based energy matrix and technologically advanced agri-business sector will give the country an advantage in the global energy transition.
Weaknesses
Policy towards private enterprise and competition depends on the political landscape. The terms of the presidents of both houses of Congress expire this year, and there is a risk that their replacements will be more aligned with Lula. This would weaken the legislature's capacity to act as a check on the administration's statist and interventionist policies.
What to watch- The Supreme Federal Court (STF) is in deliberations over an attempt by the Lula administration to regain state control over Eletrobras, an electric power company that was privatised in 2022. The renationalisation of Eletrobras (not our baseline scenario) would shake investor confidence in the legal system and the enforceability of contracts.
- Petrobras, a state-controlled oil and gas firm, is often subject to political interference, and Lula will nudge its corporate decisions to cater to his social and political agenda. For example, Petrobras's pricing policy is a constant source of friction between private shareholders and the state. Whereas private investors prefer prices to be aligned with international prices in order to maximise profits, the government is concerned about inflationary pressures. In May 2024 Lula ousted the company's head, Jean Paul Prates, and replaced him with Magda Chambriard, a well-regarded engineer. We expect her to be pragmatic and ensure broad continuity, but there is a risk that she will be more tolerant of state intervention than Mr Prates.

Foreign trade and exchange controls Overview
Brazil's highest score is for foreign trade and exchange controls. This reflects a strong current-account position, capital-account liberalisation, and ease and openness to trade, although there is room for improvement in terms of lifting tariff and non-tariff protections. Brazil's score remains unchanged from the 2019-23 historical period, but the country drops by five spots in the global ranking (surpassed by the likes of Vietnam, Jordan and South Africa) and by one position in the regional ranking (losing out to El Salvador).
Strengths
Although we expect imports to increase as domestic demand strengthens, exports will also grow, especially as crude oil production expands. Sizeable inward FDI inflows will also help to contain the current-account deficit. Brazil's floating exchange-rate regime, which is lightly managed by the independent central bank, and robust foreign reserves support the currency, which shields the country against a balance-of-payments crisis.
Weaknesses
Lula's preference for promoting trade and investment relations within the global south will weigh on partnership opportunities with advanced economies. For example, OECD accession has been put on the back burner in order to focus on the BRICS group of emerging markets. The group initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but Brazil pushed for its expansion, approving membership invitations to countries including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the UAE in 2023. Lula will seek to strengthen the enlarged BRICS as well as Mercosul (a customs union that also includes Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay), which remains a protectionist bloc.
What to watch- Ratification of a proposed EU-Mercosul free-trade agreement (FTA) remains at an impasse, even though negotiators finalised the deal's terms in 2019. The European side is demanding more stringent environmental conditions and better protections for its farmers, and Brazil is requesting protectionist public procurement rules. There is a chance that the prospect of a Mercosul-China FTA—a deal that Uruguay is particularly keen to sign—will pressure European parliaments to be more flexible with their terms, expediting ratification of the deal. However, our view is that ratification is unlikely in 2024-28, especially as gains made by right-wing parties at the recent European Parliament elections in June 2024 will strengthen the union's protectionist bloc.
- A reform to make Mercosul more flexible is possible. Although Brazil has the most influence over the bloc, the left-right ideological balance within Mercosul has skewed against Lula, as Argentina joined the liberal wing (previously comprising only Paraguay and Uruguay) following the election of its far-right president, Javier Milei, in late 2023. Lula could allow some piecemeal reforms to prevent the bloc from fragmenting.
- Lula is attempting to guide Brazil's export-oriented commodity sector to an ESG-friendly course. If he is successful, strong ESG credentials are likely to improve Brazil's position in brokering favourable deals and would boost trade.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: Lula struggles to push his progressive agenda through Congress as parties in his fragile coalition begin to jockey for position in run-up to 2026 general election.
2027-29: Relations between executive and legislature remain problematic, given Brazil's fragmented political system and highly polarised society, sustaining political and social stability risks.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: Lower government spending and monetary tightening dampen investment and consumption, causing real GDP growth to slow. Record grains harvest in 2024/25 season maintains floor under broader economic deceleration.
2027-29: Piecemeal progress on growth-enhancing, structural reforms and limited labour productivity keep average GDP growth rates tepid.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Easy-to-extract lithium deposits and substantial nickel and rare-earth reserves increase investment opportunities in critical minerals.
2027-29: As government streamlines tax rules and reduces red tape, new opportunities emerge in infrastructure, agriculture and energy.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: Current right-leaning Congress dilute Lula's statist economic policies, but leaders of both houses could become more Lula-friendly following congressional leadership elections in February 2025.
2027-29: Fiscal constraints encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment partnerships programme becomes more established and reliable, with improved legal framework and stronger regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: Lula's “non-aligned" foreign policies and push for a multipolar world create tensions with some major Western powers, weighing on investor sentiment.
2027-29: Brazil remains among top destinations of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally. Opportunities are plentiful, particularly in areas related to global energy transition, such as critical minerals and green hydrogen.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: Crude oil production and exports expand, propping up trade growth, attracting FDI and building foreign reserves.
2027-29: Ratification of EU-Mercosul free-trade agreement is unlikely, but Brazil's improved environmental, social and governance agenda help in trade negotiations with EU, and potentially with other countries and regional blocs.
Taxes
2025-26: Lula advances with tax simplification reform. Government tries to reform income taxes and to introduce taxes on wealthy Brazilians and on dividends, but right-leaning Congress hinders efforts.
2027-29: Tax simplification starts to come into effect, but full impact will only be felt from 2033.
Financing
2025-26: Subsidised credit increases, but with higher participation from private banks, as government offers collaterals.
2027-29: Role of private capital markets in Brazil's financing structure expands. Fiscal constraints and high indebtedness limit extent to which direct public lending drives growth.
The labour market
2025-26: Lula retains elements of 2017 labour reform but seeks targeted changes, such as stronger protection for informal, autonomous workers and for gender equality.
2027-29: Higher educational and specialised training levels among Brazil's youth lift labour productivity over long term.
Infrastructure
2025-26: Infrastructure concessions advance, but political and institutional constraints sustain risk of delays.
2027-29: Infrastructure gap stays wide, as sector investments are insufficient to maintain and expand projects.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Congress stalls bills on digital oversight and regulation owing to concerns about their impact on innovation.
2027-29: E-government services and digital inclusion advance, especially as central bank's digital currency gains traction.
Infrastructure Overview
Brazil's difficulty in reversing long-standing deficiencies in infrastructure provision—partly due to fiscal constraints, mismanagement and corruption—keeps its score in this category weak, despite marginal improvements in road density. Brazil falls into the lowest quintile, overtaken by countries including Kenya, India and Vietnam. However, Brazil's regional ranking improves by one position, displacing Peru.
Strengths
Brazil performs well for broadband connection speed, and its distribution, ports and airports infrastructure are fair. Operators are expanding the 5G network quickly. The Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel, the telecoms agency) expects 5G coverage to reach 85% of the population by mid-2024 (from just 24% in 2022), as mobile operators will be able to access more spectrum in the 3.5-GHz band. Access to electricity is high, but reliability of the electricity supply is poor, owing to its reliance on hydropower plants amid vulnerability to climate change risks. The Lula administration considers infrastructure development an important vehicle for creating jobs, meaning that investments will continue as the government pursues PPP projects via its PPI.
Weaknesses
At about 2% of GDP, public and private spending in infrastructure is low—below the estimated 4% of GDP needed just to prevent existing infrastructure from decaying, according to Inter.B, a local consultancy that specialises in the sector. Although most Brazilians have a mobile phone, network coverage is below the global average, largely because the country's territory is vast and includes impenetrable areas in the Amazon region. The country relies heavily on road transport, which is insufficient and poor, as extensive lengths of roads are unpaved. Sanitation infrastructure is also lacking; only about 84% of the urban population is serviced with potable water and 55% with sewage networks.
What to watch- Private concessions of infrastructure assets through the PPI will advance, driving upgrade efforts in 2024-28. Since its launch in 2016, 241 projects have been completed under the PPI. As at May 2024 there were 208 projects in the pipeline, led by transport (85), urban infrastructure (43) and environmental projects (23).
- Although the previous administration's plan to privatise the Port of Santos (Latin America's largest port) has been scrapped, the Lula government has continued to increase private participation in the port by using the PPP model for specific port components that need upgrades. Political disagreements have not impeded the advancement of PPP projects related to the Port of Santos so far, but the risk of project delays will rise as the 2026 general election approaches.
- Sanitation projects remain delayed but will pick up as it becomes clear to investors that the liberalising 2022 basic sanitation reform will stay in place. In 2023 Lula attempted to walk back some market-friendly aspects of the basic sanitation reform by giving a leg-up to SOEs, for example by making it easier for state companies to retain contracts, relaxing economic and financial capacity criteria for companies to sign new contracts, and allowing state companies to take on contracts without bidding in some metropolitan regions. Congress overturned the decrees, signalling that the sector will not be renationalised.

Abstract: The National Information Technology Development Agency has been tasked with creating a Nigerian blockchain network, Nigerium, to protect data and promote security in digital commerce. What to watch A fiscal policy and tax reforms committee, which was inaugurated by Mr Tinubu in August 2023, has proposed reforms of Nigeria's major tax laws, with the aim of boosting fiscal revenue while simultaneously reforming the tax system to encourage private investment, support growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reducing the impact of taxation on low-income earners. A potential merger of revenue collection agencies—such as the Nigerian Customs Service, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency and the Federal Inland Revenue Service—under a single revenue agency (the proposed Nigerian Revenue Service), in multiple executive tax reform bills that are with the legislature for passage into law, will also be something to watch. Mr Tinubu's eight-point agenda, which was announced in August 2023, emphasises improving the business environment through easier access to capital and strengthening of the rule of law.

Full text: Overview
Nigeria's ranking for technological readiness is 78th in 2025-29. Nigeria is the second-largest telecoms market in Africa (after South Africa, and just ahead of Egypt), if measured in terms of subscribers. However, Nigeria scores poorly in technological readiness. Patent applications and research and development expenditure are low. Mobile-phone ownership and internet usage are high, but these are largely concentrated in urban hubs. Mobile-phone subscriptions reached a peak of 226.8m in February 2023, up by 14.7% year on year, but dropped to 219.3m in March (the latest reported month), suggesting that the market is close to saturation. There is limited space for expansion outside wider coverage of rural areas.
Strengths
Mobile-phone and internet coverage in Nigeria's vast rural areas remain relatively low, offering new opportunities for telecoms firms from maturing urban markets, although the affordability of products and services will be key. After several years of phenomenal growth the telecoms industry faces the challenge of expanding services profitably beyond largely urban markets, and many rural markets are relatively unpenetrated.
Weaknesses
The challenge of (profitably) expanding infrastructure to often-remote locations blighted by insecurity will remain a limiting factor. Companies have had to invest heavily in cyber-security, and hacking attempts are fairly commonplace. Many untapped market segments are low income, and customers will struggle to afford services such as 4G and 5G.
What to watch- New 5G licences offer strong prospects for expanding high-speed internet coverage. Satellite broadband internet technologies, such as Starlink by SpaceX (US), were approved by the authorities in May 2022 and launched in early 2023. This could help to stem a decline in broadband coverage, but a shrinking middle class will take time to recover, and many consumers will be priced out. Broadband subscriptions in Nigeria were at 122,260 (just about 0.05% of the population) in March 2024, a substantial decrease from highs of about 150,000 in 2017.
- The National Blockchain Policy, which was approved in May 2023 by the Buhari administration, could add as much as US$4bn annually to the Nigerian economy. The National Information Technology Development Agency has been tasked with creating a Nigerian blockchain network, Nigerium, to protect data and promote security in digital commerce.


Taxes Overview
Nigeria's ranking for taxes is 72nd in 2025-29, a worsening of nine places from 2020-24, reflecting expected increases to VAT. As the fiscal revenue/GDP ratio is at less than 10% across all tiers of government, Nigeria has one of the lowest tax takes in the world. This will be a particular weak point for the business environment as the federal debt service/revenue ratio (at times close to 100%) makes tax increases in some form unavoidable. A low level of compliance, numerous exemptions and the continuation of a petro-state model that is unsuited to current levels of oil production have led the public finances into an unsustainable position. VAT is currently set at 7.5%, and we expect it to increase to 15% by 2027; increases to business rates are also possible.
Strengths
There is substantital space to boost tax revenue by spreading the tax net to cover the huge informal economy that relies on electronic payments; cash accounts for less than 5% of the money supply. Tax rates are also relatively low, particularly for VAT (a legacy of Nigeria's dated petro-state model) and there is ample room for increases.
Weaknesses
Powerful vested interests will retain their tax advantages through exemptions and various incentive schemes, and the tax collection service has numerous shortcomings (as highlighted by a low level of compliance). Although low oil revenue will incentivise the authorities to improve their efforts to boost tax compliance and reduce tax exemptions, it is doubtful that the federal tax/GDP ratio will rise much above 10% of GDP before 2027. This will continue to put pressure on the government to find new ways of improving revenue, raising the prospect of an erratic tax policy.
What to watch- A fiscal policy and tax reforms committee, which was inaugurated by Mr Tinubu in August 2023, has proposed reforms of Nigeria's major tax laws, with the aim of boosting fiscal revenue while simultaneously reforming the tax system to encourage private investment, support growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reducing the impact of taxation on low-income earners. The government hopes that changes to fiscal and tax policies will help to increase the tax/GDP ratio from current lows, but the committee is also likely to recommend VAT increases, reportedly as soon as 2025 (to 10%).
- A potential merger of revenue collection agencies—such as the Nigerian Customs Service, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency and the Federal Inland Revenue Service—under a single revenue agency (the proposed Nigerian Revenue Service), in multiple executive tax reform bills that are with the legislature for passage into law, will also be something to watch.


Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
Nigeria's ranking for policy towards private enterprise and competition has worsened to 73rd in 2025-29. Work to improve the business environment to engender private enterprise and competition has been fitful over the past decade. Ambitious development plans often underwhelm as vested interests rub up against reforms and changing political priorities disrupt long-term planning. Although there is popular backing in theory for moves to open up the economy to private enterprise, the political mood quickly changes when such actions involve dismantling the network of patronage and subsidies that consumers and politicians have become accustomed to.
Strengths
The 2021-25 official development plan advocates a mixture of market-oriented reforms and economic self-sufficiency, as did the 2017-20 Economic Recovery and Growth Plan before it. Mr Tinubu's eight-point agenda, which was announced in August 2023, emphasises improving the business environment through easier access to capital and strengthening of the rule of law. Faced with hugely challenging economic circumstances, the Tinubu administration has little choice but to court firms as far as it can.
Weaknesses
Influential lobbyists in Nigeria have long profited from protectionist policies and have frustrated efforts to liberalise markets. Oil marketers have reportedly been an obstacle to the ramping-up of the Dangote fuel refinery, according to its owner, in a high-profile case reflecting complexities and rent-seeking behaviour in the petroleum market. Several sectors have a monopolistic market structure, often based on political considerations. This applies to construction materials, has affected telecoms and petrol distribution in the past, and may yet happen with regard to refining.
What to watch- The planned sale of state-owned enterprises and a rollback of subsidised development financing of firms selected (often arbitrarily) by the central bank signals a preference for a less regulated economy.
- The end of subsidies for fuel and electricity, which are both important in their own way for engendering competition and ensuring a level playing field, is a key factor to watch. Whether unpopular reforms can survive a hostile security-political backdrop is dubious, including over the longer term.


The labour market Overview
Nigeria's ranking for the labour market is 79th. The government of Mr Tinubu has prioritised to reduce unemployment and boost job creation, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing, as did the previous administration—under Muhammadu Buhari in 2015-23—with little success. Although Mr Tinubu has burnished his credentials early on as a liberalising reformer, there is not a comprehensive strategy for raising skills and delivering a workforce for industry.
Strengths
Union bargaining power is to some extent circumscribed by limited employment opportunities in the formal sector. The official underemployment rate, of 10.6% in the first quarter of 2024, refers to those working less than 40 hours, although wage rigidity could be an issue in higher-skilled industries. Labour law reform in 2005 weakened the capacity of unions to organise political or sympathy strikes.
Weaknesses
The labour movement remains powerful in major industries, such as oil production, and capable of organising paralysing national strikes. Industrial action has become more commonplace owing to the cost-of-living crisis, and especially over the issue of petrol subsidies and electricity tariffs.
What to watch- The next minimum wage review is in 2027, with the period between reviewed having been shortened from five years to three in 2024. A sizeable increase can be expected, although the government managed to negotiate a huge reduction from what unions were demanding in 2024.
- The political ascendancy of the union-affiliated LP, which performed surprisingly well in the presidential election in February 2023, also bears watching, especially as its future prospects are increasingly bright. The LP has a support base that spreads across the majority youth population, the middle class and the already politically powerful labour union establishment.


Macroeconomic environment Overview
The macroeconomic environment ranking has worsened to 73rd in 2025-29. Nigeria's economy is heavily exposed to terms-of-trade shocks, especially declines in the price of oil, which accounts for a low share of GDP (5-10%) but about 80% of exports and one-third of government revenue. The currency has been liberalised, which will work against major imbalances, but the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria have a high tolerance for inflation, which will continue to undermine macro-stability.
Strengths
The Nigerian economy is historically resilient, despite daunting challenges. Nigeria emerged from the two most recent recessions (in 2016 and 2020) fairly quickly. Hard-currency scarcity, wasteful subsidies, entrenched corruption, burgeoning debt and fiscal recklessness have not pushed the economy to a point of outright crisis, although they have left it in secular low growth. Although oil is vital to lubricating the foreign-exchange market, agriculture (which contributes a quarter of GDP) is insulated to a greater extent from global shocks.
Weaknesses
High inflation, tight monetary policy and still-constrained foreign-exchange availability are constraints on investment and economic growth. The pace of the recovery will be insufficient to reverse the decline in the country's real GDP per head in recent years and the corresponding rise in poverty. Public debt is enormously costly to service against the backdrop of a low revenue base, limiting the scope for productive fiscal policy. Insecure property rights, an inefficient civil service, confusion caused by contradictions between local, state and federal government actions, and deeply entrenched vested interests opposed to free-market competition will all combine to keep economic performance below potential.
What to watch- Foreign-exchange market reforms have unified the market, but the naira remains highly volatile. Although the new central bank governor, Yemi Cardoso, is attempting to bring monetary policy onto a more orthodox footing, negative short-term real interest rates are expected to persist, given fiscal pressures and the government's pro-growth agenda, and inflation will stay above the 9% target ceiling. Political pressure to stabilise the rate could prompt a return to heavier currency management, although we believe that this is unlikely.
- Mr Tinubu wants interest rates to be reduced, despite a backdrop of high inflation. The central bank's policy will continue to drive economic growth, although the government's fiscal footprint is becoming substantial. This, however, will increasingly crowd out the private sector.


Market opportunities Overview
Nigeria's ranking for market opportunities has worsened from 46th in 2020-24 to 47th in 2024-29, reflecting a collapse in the US dollar value of GDP. As one of Africa's major economies, with the highest population on the continent, Nigeria is naturally an attractive market for multinationals from a range of sectors (such as agro-processing, healthcare, telecommunications and consumer goods). Nigeria is, however, a low-income country, and expenditure on food and drink accounts for the largest part of household spending. High global food and energy commodity prices have exerted further upward pressure on this segment of the consumer market over the past two years. In US dollar terms, we expect household consumption per head to fall by 35% from 2022 levels by 2027, reflecting a steep devaluation of the naira in 2023-24. The recovery in later years will be partial. Household consumption in total will also have fallen between 2022 and 2025, by 32%. Nigeria still has a sizeable middle class and a small wealthy and ultra-wealthy elite—the sizes of which compare with African peers outside of South Africa and North Africa—and these will remain important sub-segments of the market. Nigeria has the potential to be a profitable destination for multinational companies, but this will involve surmounting its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and overcoming the logistical difficulties that are posed by a lack of infrastructure, for example by providing their own (expensive) power and water supplies.
Strengths
A population bulge will continue to offer prospects for productivity gains and higher consumption, but only if education and human capital development, where Nigeria currently ranks low, are given greater priority. The population is projected to reach 257m in 2029 and 359m by 2050, exceeding any other African country by a large margin and making Nigeria among the most populous in the world. Providing jobs will be a challenge, but as economic growth quickens over the medium to long term there should be greater demand for luxury or non-essential goods.
Weaknesses
Currency devaluations in 2023-24 were a full-blown correction from years of overvaluation. The scale of the currency loss has left the US-dollar value of nominal GDP for 2024 at less than half the level in 2022, by our estimates, and this will remain about 40% lower even in 2029. Socioeconomic pressures will remain high in the shorter term, owing to a cost-of-living crisis, as households cut discretionary spending and exhaust savings.
What to watch- Real private consumption has contracted precipitously in recent years, and by more 10% in 2023; we estimate that it will have fallen by another 2.3% in 2024. There should be some improvement in 2025, with private consumption growth of 1.3%, assuming that the currency stabilises, inflation moderates and wider output growth picks up.
- Several multinationals with operations in Nigeria have announced an exit from Nigeria or are actively attempting to leave after steep currency devaluations eroded profits or made them insolvent in hard-currency terms, given overseas liabilities. This could deliver opportunities for new entrants, and the currency situation is likely to become less volatile.


Financing Overview
Nigeria's ranking for financing is 73rd. The Nigerian banking sector is just about adequately capitalised, although buffers have been reduced by a sizeable currency devaluation since June 2023 (with about 30-40% of loans typically denominated in foreign currency) which has inflated risk-weighted assets. Regulation and excessive central bank interference are the principal restraints on the banking sector's health and profitability. The ratio of reserves required, at 50%, is among the highest worldwide, and conflicts with other central bank directives, such as a minimum loan/deposit ratio of 50%, which itself impedes effective risk management. Interest rates remain relatively high, but negative in real terms, and loans are largely inaccessible to SMEs.
Strengths
The banking sector is undergoing a recapitalisation exercise, which is likely to result in the merger of smaller banks and sectoral consolidation. The increase in minimums will be needed for banks to pursue lending growth over the medium terms. As qualifying capital excludes retained earnings, the exercise will stimulate activity on the local capital market. Informational gaps on borrowers are a constraint to lending growth, but banks have strengthened credit management frameworks; non-performing loans surpassed 15% of total loans during 2017, but the ratio has been falling (to 5% at end-March 2024).
Weaknesses
SMEs are, and will continue to be, excluded from credit, either through rationing or a high risk premium charged (with the maximum lending rate at about 30% in September 2024). The loan/deposit ratio has fluctuated between 58% and 64% since 2020, at times undercutting the minimum threshold, underpinning a hesitancy to lend. Return on assets and capital has been held back as a result.
What to watch- The government's efforts to create a long-term government bond market, with increasingly regular issues of 30-year Treasury bonds since 2019, will help with the pricing of corporate debt and might allow the development of a more active corporate bond market in the future.
- The recapitalisation exercise will consolidate the banking sector, enhancing its resilience, but potentially also reducing competition, depending on how deep consolidation goes. Although new investors will be eager for returns, it is unlikely that credit conditions for SMEs will improve.
- Whether Nigeria stays on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), for deficient systems against money laundering and financing of terrorism, will also be a factor to watch. Nigeria remains on a list of countries for enhanced follow-up, and was put on the grey list in early 2023; it has not yet made strides sufficient to satisfy the FATF. This could affect investor interest in recapitalising, and is negative for the ability of banks to raise capital internationally.


Policy towards foreign investment Overview
Nigeria's ranking for policy towards private investment has deterioriated to 73rd in 2025-29. An opaque and slow-moving policy environment has historically put off many would-be foreign investors in Nigeria. The government is keen to attract foreign capital to augment economic development, especially given low fiscal resources for infrastructure upgrades. However, FDI has been low since the end of the 2011-14 commodity price supercycle, at less than 1% of GDP a year. This is due largely to slowness in tackling issues that make production costs in Nigeria extremely high. Infrastructure deficiencies—in particular electricity shortages—will rule out a large non-oil export base for global markets.
Strengths
The Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) finalised the tax regime in 2021 when it was passed into law. Various iterations of the legislation had been in the works for about a decade. The PIA is a broadly more competitive fiscal regime than the previous arrangement, and this will be promising for offshore investment in particular.
Weaknesses
As a challenging operating environment, Nigeria will struggle to contend with a global trend of multinational oil companies reassessing their upstream asset holdings around the world. Shell (UK), the first and the biggest international oil company to enter Nigeria, is selling its onshore assets, as have other producers such as TotalEnergies (France), Chevron and ExxonMobil (US) and Eni (Italy). Policy towards divestments has been inconsistent, and producers have faced numerous regulatory hurdles, which has delayed sales.
What to watch- The central bank doubled the minimum capital requirement for banks, with international banks needing at least N500bn (US$299.2m) by March 2026. Retained profits and additional Tier 1 capital will not count under new rules. Options include rights issues, private placements, mergers or scale-backs, with an eye on attracting overseas investment. However, banks have been hit with a retroactive taxation bill for currency revaluation gains. This is likely to have an impact on banks' ability to attract investor interest from overseas, and it is possible that the realities of a wide budget deficit and reluctance to raise taxes will lead to further regulatory erraticism.
- Oil executives have welcomed the fiscal terms and predictability offered by the PIA, but are proceeding with caution. The PIA might not reassure majors involved in onshore operations, owing to their carbon footprint and persistent instability, which costs the industry hundreds of thousands of barrels a day through theft, vandalism and sabotage. The oil sector therefore faces a mixed picture of factors, and investment is falling well short of highs during the 2011-14 commodity supercycle.


Business environment rankings Overview
Nigeria's business environment will remain among the most challenging in the world over the next five years. Burgeoning market opportunities as the population expands, alongside economic reforms, carry the potential for long-term improvements, but Nigeria remains in 76th place of 82 economies assessed in 2025-29. In the early part of the forecast period Nigeria will grapple with high inflation, a collapse in US dollar market size and an overstretched fiscal position and sluggish output. International oil prices are expected to be high enough to lubricate the system and prevent a recession, but Nigeria will not return to the high rates of economic growth that it achieved in the first decade of the 21st century. Low growth and its secularity have made the administration more mindful of the business environment, even if reforms fall well behind intentions or rhetoric.
Strengths
A pro-business administration since May 2023 will be more aggressive in implementing the remainder of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-25. The NDP emphasises the government's active participation—in partnership with the private sector—in key segments of the economy, with the goal of achieving an average real GDP growth rate of about 5%, creating about 21m jobs and lifting 35m people out of poverty. The goal of cutting unemployment and underemployment (with about a quarter of the workforce working less than 20 hours a week) will also be central to policymaking over the longer term. The government of Mr Tinubu, the president, has successfully pressed ahead with the NDP's goals of a unified and efficient currency regime, alongside the elimination of fuel and electricity subsidies. The aim is to attract investment and expand fiscal space for the government's ambitious development agenda, although progress on these fronts is likely to be slower burning.
Weaknesses
Other proposals in the NDP, such as reform of the land tenure system (which weighs on agricultural production), and public-sector reforms—especially cutting the cost of running the government—will probably be half-hearted for the remainder of the NDP years (2024-25), as they are politically charged issues. The size of the bureaucracy will, if anything, increase. Structurally, institutions are sclerotic and dysfunctional on multiple levels, with corruption, politicisation of the judiciary, rampant instability and wide infrastructure gaps all drawbacks to the business environment.
What to watch- How far the Tinubu administration can take market reforms, both those undertaken and proposed, will require close scrutiny. We expect the government to successfully manage trade union demands and for market reforms already undertaken to survive, but further advancements to the business environment are unlikely, especially where they affect consumers, who are already grappling with the cost of living.
- The fiscal stance is loose and has involved a rapid build-up in public debt. The authorities, in our view, have no choice but to increase taxes, and there is a risk that investors will be caught out by surprise retroactive taxation.


The political environment Overview
Nigeria's ranking for the political environment is 75th of 82 countries for 2025-29. Nigeria has a pronounced north-south divide, founded on ethnicity, religion and economic development, and this shapes political allegiances between the ruling party, the APC (which has its support base in the north) and the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP, which draws support from the south). Northern governors have acted as crucial power brokers in the past three elections, and wield enormous influence over constituencies that tend to vote as a unified bloc. However, inflation on a scale unsurpassed in Nigeria's modern history, which can be traced back to Mr Tinubu's policy decisions, will make the next presidential race more about voter concerns over the economy than about regional, ethnic or religious considerations. This could cause Mr Tinubu to lose power, as we provisionally expect, but so far nobody within the opposition is putting forward an alternative vision to Mr Tinubu and the APC. A restive youth population will continue to pose a risk to political stability, but the dark memories of past military rule will enable the establishment to maintain control. Large parts of Nigeria will meanwhile be virtually ungovernable, and crime will be rampant in some areas, as will terrorism.
Strengths
Despite hotly disputed elections over the years, results have been accepted after court rulings. The ruling APC has been able to maintain a façade of relative stability, in contrast to the main opposition parties, which are still reeling from losses in the past three elections. Legislative pushback will remain limited, with the National Assembly (parliament) largely under the thumb of Mr Tinubu, allowing important legislation to pass. There is a broad cross-party consensus on what Nigeria needs to do economically, with acknowledgement that this entails potentially painful reforms to make Nigeria more attractive to investors.
Weaknesses
Anti-government protests will be commonplace as hardships from economic reforms continue to bite into 2025-26. Industrial relations will be tense, and nationwide strikes over the cost of living are likely. The next review of the minimum wage in 2027 will be a particular flashpoint. The pro-market agenda is likely to falter ahead of the 2027 polls, in favour of populist measures to win back the electorate. Banditry and terrorism in northern Nigeria will remain disruptive, especially on agricultural production and strategic electricity infrastructure. Sahelian disunity will also weigh on security efforts, and on regional cohesion via the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as the mostly military governments in francophone West Africa seek alternative spheres of influence beyond the reach of France. Weak institutions, especially the judiciary, legislature and electoral commission, and popular perceptions of institutional capture by the ruling APC will continue to erode trust in the state's capacity to ensure rule of law, fair elections and security.
What to watch- Proposed constitutional amendments around regionalism and devolution of powers to federation units will bear watching; particularly notable among these are the creation of subnational police forces and more republican distribution of tax revenue. Replacement of the current presidential system with a parliamentary system features on the agenda of the APC—which probably fears unpopularity at the 2027 polls—as this will allow the president to be elected by politicians, cutting off an electorate geared towards change.
- An alliance between political parties in the opposition to present a common front against the APC ahead of the 2027 elections is likely, and may be encompassing enough to change the political tide. Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) would have to make a power-sharing arrangement with Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, which may be difficult, as both have their eyes on the presidency. If a deal can be struck, a coalition between the PDP and LP would avoid vote-splitting in the south, which is Mr Tinubu's main strength.
- Thawing of tensions with neighbouring Niger and resolution of frictions with the military governments of francophone members of ECOWAS is worth watching, especially if it results in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso dropping their desire to cease being members of the regional body. Cohesion between Sahelian members to fight spreading Islamist terrorism in the region will also be worth observing as Nigeria maintains strong relations with France, in addition to the US and the UK, its traditional Western allies.


Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: The 2027 election cycle starts early, with the opposition kicking into gear to build support, and the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) moving to placate disillusioned northern allies.
2027-29: The political environment is tense during the 2027 general elections. We expect the president, Bola Tinubu, to lose power owing to public frustration over high inflation.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: A disinflationary trend enables monetary policy easing, but interest rates remain relatively high, and exchange-rate depreciation persists, although volatility lessens.
2027-29: The import bill is reduced by sufficient domestic fuel production—with earnings from exports of crude oil and refined petroleum products rising in tandem—as local crude oil refining gathers steam and constraints on upstream production ease. Price stability, fiscal consolidation and exchange-rate strength buoy economic growth.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Consumption remains subdued as high inflation continues to erode purchasing power. Deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector begins to encourage foreign investor interest in the economy as economic reforms begin to show positive results.
2027-29: Better-capitalised banks boost private-sector credit extension, with the energy sector likely to draw the most attention, although the agriculture and information communication technology sectors will probably also attract financial support.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: Policy is aimed at pro-business goals. Trade barriers to foreign competition are removed to reduce inflation.
2027-29: There is official talk of NNPC Limited, the state oil company, preparing for partial privatisation (probably through an initial public offering), but we do not expect this to materialise.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: A flexible exchange rate gradually brings in more foreign direct investment (FDI), but the impact is underwhelming in the absence of wider reforms, especially fiscal consolidation.
2027-29: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, but concerted efforts are made to commercialise the national oil company (which is in joint ventures with multinationals).
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: Current-account restrictions are eased further and suspension of import duties on some pharmaceutical and agricultural goods in 2024 is extended.
2027-29: Foreign-exchange shortages re-emerge as oil prices slide, heightening the risk of capital controls and other convertibility restrictions.
Taxes
2025-26: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, accompanied by tax increases, although the weak state of the economy, in a context of hard-biting economic reforms and a high cost of living, weighs on enforcement.
2027-29: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is increased from 7.5% to 15% to cut the budget deficit and manage debt-service costs.
Financing
2025-26: The international capital market opens up for a potential Eurobond issuance from early 2025. A large budget deficit crowds out private-sector lending.
2027-29: Higher tax revenue limits recourse to fiscal deficit financing via central bank overdrafts.
The labour market
2025-26: Real wage growth is negative and unemployment is fairly low. Skills shortages and strikes are major issues.
2027-29: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff and face high costs from retaining skilled workers.
Infrastructure
2025-26: A large private refinery starts operating, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependence on imported petrol.
2027-29: Public investment in infrastructure lags behind budgeted levels and the rate needed to plug the infrastructure gap.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside of urban hubs.
2027-29: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Foreign trade and exchange controls Overview
Nigeria's ranking for foreign trade and exchange controls is 79th in 2025-29. The Tinubu administration has ended foreign-exchange bans on imports of various agricultural goods and manufactures, and the central bank cleared a backlog of foreign-exchange orders worth billions of US dollars as part of efforts to unify the foreign-exchange market in early 2024. The legacy and recentness of current- and capital-account controls holds the ranking back, as does a history of sealing borders and a high average tariff of more than 12% in 2023. However, we broadly expect a more liberal attitude to trade over 2025-29 as the government prioritises consumer prices over protectionism. The risk of convertibility restrictions reappearing de jure or de facto is also confined by the ramp-up of the 650,000-barrel/day Dangote refinery, which will over time eliminate the need for domestic fuel imports (historically indispensable), shoring up a continual current-account surplus.
Strengths
Mr Tinubu's administration has made impressive strides to consolidate the foreign-exchange regime. The multiple official foreign-exchange windows were unified into the single rate and the spread with the parallel market has vanished. The central bank and government share the view that a market-based currency is vital to enhancing transparency, investment and ultimately economic growth.
Weaknesses
Confidence in the central bank's commitment to price stability, and consequently the naira, remains low, driving up demand for US dollars. Inflation is high and again rising. The spiral has been ongoing since 2022 and political pressure to stop the cost-of-living crisis could push the government to change course on market reform and begin manipulating the exchange rate to lessen consumer costs. Supportive near-term world oil prices gives the authorities the firepower to do so.
What to watch- The Tinubu administration slashed import tariffs on some pharmaceuticals and foods in order to tame consumer price growth. This has outraged agricultural lobbyists, who say that the measure undermines domestic food production and will leave Nigeria hooked on imports if farmers, grappling with high fertiliser costs, go bust. If Mr Tinubu extends the cuts beyond the expiry date in December 2024 indefinitely, it will be a sign that his administration is ready to undo protectionism to a greater extent than we currently expect.
- The authorities' efforts to limit diversion of remittances and export proceeds to unofficial channels will begin to yield some positive results as the official window becomes more frictionless and credible.


Infrastructure Overview
Nigeria's ranking for infrastructure is 82nd for 2025-29. The infrastructure gap is enormous, and a major hindrance to sustained economic growth, making Nigeria the worst-ranked country for infrastructure of the economies covered, in both regional and global terms. Overall infrastructure will remain sub-par by international and regional standards, owing to many years of underinvestment and slow execution of projects. Successive governments have failed to deliver on promises to improve and expand basic services in areas such as power, water, transport, healthcare and education. The government cannot invest at the rate that Nigeria requires to close its mammoth infrastructure deficit, which is officially costed at more than US$2trn over the next two decades. This has given momentum to reform efforts, most recently by allowing the formation of mini-grids with decentralised generation, transmission and distribution networks, all opened up to private investors. The transition to new grids will be a long-term endeavour, but the investment case in the power sector, although far from ideal, is strengthening.
Strengths
A giant 650,000-b/d oil refinery near Lagos, established by a Nigerian billionaire, Aliko Dangote, is expected to ramp up to capacity from early until late 2025. For Nigeria, the Dangote refinery, when it produces at full capacity, could end periodic fuel shortages and eliminate the import bill for petrol (potentially relieving the naira of considerable pressure) if the domestic price remains market-led. If not, the facility will probably export to the regional market. The beginning of petrol production by the refinery heralded a credible end to fuel subsidies in late 2024, making the facility a game-changer for foreign-exchange supply and the availability of fuel.
Weaknesses
A lack of private investment in the development of power infrastructure and privatised electricity companies' failure to invest more in upgrading and expanding their deficient facilities are due largely to the legacy of price ceilings that prevent cost recovery. A subsidy is still in place, although discriminatory pricing for premium electricity consumers is already enabling better revenue performance for suppliers. Similarly, thermal power-generating stations have been hampered for years by shortages of gas supplies—in a country with abundant natural gas reserves—mainly because official gas prices have been too low to entice companies to invest in developing the costly infrastructure that is needed to harness gas for domestic use. On top of this, gas pipelines are frequently vandalised. The national grid frequently trips off, often owing to creaky equipment but more recently because of sabotage by criminal groups or terrorists, creating a new risk for investors.
What to watch- The government's plan to upgrade and expand Nigeria's electricity grid to increase reliable power supply to 11,000 MW by 2023 has failed. However, it ultimately aims to increase overall grid capacity to 25,000 MW; although unlikely in 2025-29, this bears watching. Cost-reflective tariffs will be the regulators' policy in principle, although price increases will remain sensitive to political factors, as past suspension of tariff rises shows. There will be regular tariff reviews by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to reflect changes in inflation, foreign exchange, gas prices, available generation capacity and the capital needs of the industry.
- Nigeria's new Electricity Act, signed by Mr Tinubu, decentralises the power sector, replacing legislation from 2005. This change allows states to have dual jurisdiction over electricity, addressing issues such as bottlenecks in transmission and distribution. The centralised system previously struggled with inefficiencies, leading to investor mistrust and customer dissatisfaction. The new regulations permit states, firms, and individuals to engage in the electricity value chain, with smaller-scale generation and distribution exempt from licensing. This decentralisation aims to boost investment and improve electricity supply, potentially driving economic growth despite expected future economic challenges. However, material gains in power network capacity and reliability are unlikely even by 2029.

Abstract: Chinese imports will face trade barriers despite thriving domestic sectors such as electronics, where Chinese firms have captured market share. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China or the US) is likely to encourage trade diversification over the medium term. The government will facilitate business competition in sectors like shipping, financial services transport, steel and energy, which will bolster opportunities in these sectors. India's economic growth remains strong compared with most emerging-market peers, at an average of around 6.7% per year in 2025-26—making it one of the fastest-growing major economies. 2027-29:

Full text: Overview
The score for this category strengthens in 2024-28, though India still ranks behind Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. The improvement is attributable to implementation of government schemes to facilitate foreign trade. Although import reliance and tariff and non-tariff barriers will persist, progress will happen on bilateral free-trade agreements, while some modest liberalisation of the capital account will proceed.
Strengths
In recent years the government has reduced an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under a general scheme for goods and services. It has also invested in infrastructure; reduced costs through greater use of online platforms; permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures; and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Benefits of trade agreements concluded in the past years will filter through in the forecast period. The country has substantial foreign-exchange reserves, which makes the likelihood of foreign-exchange controls being implemented negligible.
Weaknesses
Tariff and non-tariff barriers remain high in certain areas of domestic focus or on security grounds. India will remain shy of participating in multilateral free-trade agreements on concerns of dumping and employment losses. India will remain reluctant to open up lucrative services and consumer-facing industries to foreign participants, and will demand greater mobility rights for its nationals, which will remain a major obstacle to trade talks. India remains protective of the agricultural sector, and regulatory barriers are high for the import of food and agricultural products. We expect the government to continue to sanction tariffs on selected manufactured goods in the coming years to promote domestic production. Amid concerns about Chinese goods flooding Indian markets via free-trade agreements with third countries, India will continue to push for strong rules of origin clauses in its trade negotiations.
What to watch- Bilateral free-trade negotiations will move ahead in the forecast period. We expect ongoing negotiations with partners such as the EU, the Gulf Co-operation Council, Israel, Oman and the UK to be concluded, at least in early harvest form, by 2025-26 at the latest.
- The country is likely to expand non-tariff trade barriers (like local content requirements) to promote local manufacturing in areas of strategic importance such as renewables, automotive, steel, textile and pharmaceuticals.
- India will seek to curtail imports from China (its largest foreign supplier of goods) amid strained Indo-Sino ties, as well as boost domestic manufacturing. Chinese imports will face trade barriers despite thriving domestic sectors such as electronics, where Chinese firms have captured market share. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China or the US) is likely to encourage trade diversification over the medium term.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
India's score in this category improves from 4.5 to 6 in 2024-28 to push it up the regional table by one spot, placing India between Vietnam and Malaysia. The government will facilitate business competition in sectors like shipping, financial services transport, steel and energy, which will bolster opportunities in these sectors. Insufficient protection of intellectual property and the persistence of business lobbying, which gives large corporates an edge, will remain drags on the score.
Strengths
Deregulation of most prices in the economy, including sensitive commodities in the petroleum sector, will strengthen market mechanisms to determine prices. The initiative to monetise infrastructure assets in sectors like roads, railways and energy will continue, albeit at a slower pace. The monetisation of public-sector brownfield assets including coal blocks and other mineral assets, highway stretches and power network will gain momentum. The government has encouraged competition among states by allowing them to experiment on pro-business liberalisation over and beyond the regulations imposed centrally. Legal framework and regulations to protect the interest of minority shareholders will be strengthened further; and private property rights will remain well-protected.
Weaknesses
The BJP-led government in its third term will slow its efforts to privatise state-owned enterprises amid resistance from coalition partners. Market-friendly reforms are likely to face resistance from vested interest groups. Measures to reduce red tape and facilitate the ease of doing business will achieve limited success. Delays to planned privatisation and sales will remain a constant risk, amid opposition from labour unions, a lack of private-sector participation and issues with valuation. Powerful lobbies with vested interests will distort government policies. Protection of intellectual property will remain poor and weigh on research and development (R&D) activities.
What to watch- Government will seek to implement a new digital competition law that could stop tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon (all US) from promoting their own services over competitors, or using data gathered from one company to benefit another group company. The proposed law will be based on an ex-ante framework, which sets presumptive norms to curb anti-competitive practices before they actually take place, and will impose heavy penalties for violations.
- The protection of intellectual property will improve gradually, reflecting pressure from domestic companies to toughen enforcement as local levels of investment in R&D increase. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: The narrow parliamentary majority of the ruling coalition, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJN), complicates the passage of business-oriented land and labour reforms.
2027-29: Progress on signing of bilateral trade agreements, developing defence capabilities, promoting the adoption of technology and digitisation, formulation of policies for green energy transition (which don't require parliamentary ratification) continues.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: India's economic growth remains strong compared with most emerging-market peers, at an average of around 6.7% per year in 2025-26—making it one of the fastest-growing major economies.
2027-29: Persistent current-account deficit maintains depreciatory pressure on the domestic currency.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Discretionary spending rises in urban areas owing to the growing middle class and consumer desire to purchase premium products and services.
2027-29: Market opportunities for e-commerce expand due to growing penetration of internet and smartphones.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The government maintains its drive to privatise inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and monetise infrastructure assets. Both will face resistance from the parliament owing to coalition constraints and a stronger opposition.
2027-29: The rationalisation of liquidation and bankruptcy laws continues. Government initiatives to encourage start-ups in emerging industries such as electric-vehicle (EV) components and renewable energy pick up pace.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: Production Linked Incentive schemes are tweaked to encourage domestic production. The schemes are extended to more sectors, such as chemicals and shipping grade containers. Restrictions remain in place against Chinese investment.
2027-29: Foreign investment in export manufacturing and e-commerce increases markedly.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: The government continues to support domestic manufacturing via tariff and non-tariff barriers.
2027-29: A diluted free-trade agreement (FTA) is finalised with the EU, and a broader Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement is signed with Australia. The usage of the local currency, the rupee, for international trade rises gradually.
Taxes
2025-26: Corrections are made to the inverted duty structure (inputs being taxed more highly than final output) under the goods and services tax regime, while formalisation increases. This expands the tax base.
2027-29: The government brings more individuals and corporations within the tax ambit.
Financing
2025-26: The inclusion of Indian bonds on global indices boosts foreign capital inflows.
2027-29: Consolidation continues. Equity markets remain attractive, despite higher capital gains taxes and overvaluation.
The labour market
2025-26: Registrations under the rural employment scheme fall. Minimum wage laws remain loose and non-restrictive.
2027-29: The technological ability of the skilled labour force continues to improve. A greater pool of skilled workers is available as stricter visa regulations reduce the Indian "brain drain".
Infrastructure
2025-26: Major infrastructure projects in the road and airport industries are completed. Residential uptake of solar grids accelerates under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana programme.
2027-29: The construction of defence and industrial corridors are completed.
Technological readiness
2025-26: The rollout of 5G technology accelerates. There is further progress on digitalising the delivery of public services in order to cut corruption and promote "last-mile delivery".
2027-29: The use of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) accelerates. The government announces the next phase of its cybersecurity strategy, as reliance on digital infrastructure increases.

Technological readiness Overview
India's score for technological readiness improves to 6.3 in the forecast period, with its global rank rising from 56th to 50th place. However, in the regional rankings it drops by one place to 11th owing to faster improvements in countries like China. Internet accessibility and speed will continue improving, which will be complemented by an increase in the delivery of government services online and a more conducive environment for e-commerce. However, greater coverage will expose individuals and businesses to more cyber-security risks.
Strengths
India boasts a relatively advanced R&D infrastructure, owing in part to the education system's historical bias towards higher education institutions. This has facilitated the development of research-intensive sectors. Charges for telecoms and internet services are low, making them broadly affordable for even poorer households. Currently, 5G services are available to most major urban centres and rural access will improve rapidly in the forecast period. According to the Speedtest Global Index, in June 2024 India was ranked 12th out of 108 countries for mobile internet connectivity speed. India also has a high adoption rate for e-government, e-commerce and digital payment systems.
Weaknesses
The government's restrictions on e-commerce businesses will remain in place over the next few years to protect small bricks-and-mortar businesses, and policies could be unpredictable. Cyber-security threats have been rising in frequency and intensity, and individuals and organisations are vulnerable. A report by a US cyber-security firm, Zscaler, ranked India as the third-largest country globally for phishing attacks after the US and the UK.
What to watch- China's stakes in Indian start-ups and technology companies will remain a major concern related to the protection of intellectual property rights, data privacy and national security. The Indian government will remain vigilant on potential technology transfers and enact laws in this regard.
- Emerging technologies in the Indian economy include blockchain, which has the potential to disrupt industries such as banking, healthcare, logistics and real estate. The adoption of artificial intelligence, robotics and other digital technology alternatives across healthcare, finance, manufacturing and agriculture will accelerate.
- The government will work towards projecting India as an investment and production destination for high-tech industries, including clean energy, medical devices, drones, semiconductors, and other ICT hardware, through incentives.

Financing Overview
In the financing category, an improvement in India's score in 2024-28 leads the country to rise up in the regional rank, overtaking Vietnam, Bangladesh and Indonesia, and climbs 12 places in the global rank. The improvement will be led by foreign entities enjoying much greater access to the country's capital markets and fewer financial market distortions. Implementation of recently enacted stricter data protection laws will push banks and other financial institutions to invest in robust compliance frameworks and data protection technologies and provide customers greater transparency and control over personal data.
Strengths
India's banking sector is relatively stable, buttressed by large state-owned lenders that often receive direct government support in times of stress. Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, even as privatisation accelerates. Both public- and private-sector banks are well capitalised and are compliant with Basel III capital-adequacy standards. Banks have consistently seen a reduction in non-performing assets (NPAs) over the past few years. The capital market is well-developed and provides good access to equity financing for domestic and foreign businesses. Non-bank financiers have improved their liquidity and provisional buffers, and are regulated with greater oversight since a crisis in 2018. The financial technology sector has thrived, with foreign ownership of up to 100% being allowed for financial services and technology players.
Weaknesses
Access to bank credit for some businesses is constrained in part by a long-standing policy to guarantee access to select industries, under a system known as priority-sector lending, which entails minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives. Regulation of capital markets is sub-par relative to their size, and poses risks of volatility arising from insufficient oversight. A surge in payment-related scams has highlighted growing concerns regarding cyber-crime, which could erode public confidence in banks and payment infrastructure.
What to watch- Digitisation of financial services dissemination as lenders adopt innovative digital operating models leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, complemented by a deeper penetration of internet usage, will improve access to the formal financial system.
- Indian bonds were included in the JP Morgan global bond index in June 2024, and further inclusion in other indices such as Bloomberg will follow in 2025. This inclusion, which opens up a large debt market for foreigners, will gradually deepen and broaden India's insular debt market by diversifying the investor base and lead to strong inflows into local currency-denominated government debt, tempering bond yields and supporting the domestic currency.

Policy towards foreign investment Overview
India's score for policy towards foreign investment improves substantially to 7.3 in 2024-28, from 5.5 in 2019-23, putting its rank on a par with Malaysia and Japan, and above Vietnam and the Philippines. The gains will be made by a more liberal regime towards foreign investment, as well as interest from multinationals to diversify supply chains beyond China, in conjunction with government policy to make India a more attractive manufacturing destination. Meanwhile, investor protections will strengthen from a low base.
Strengths
The BJP-led coalition government has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime since 2014 and its commitment to attract foreign capital will continue, with more incentives and streamlined regulations. The country offers fiscal incentives to foreign investors, encompassing benefits such as tax concessions, import of capital goods at concessional customs duty, special economic zones (SEZs), bilateral investment protection agreements with investing countries and, subsidies for setting up R&D facilities. Apart from the traditional services and software sectors, foreign investment will continue to branch out to include infrastructure, telecommunications, automobile, energy and domestic trade. India's large domestic market, which is the only one comparable to China, will remain lucrative for foreign investors looking to capture it. The loosening of rules regarding government approvals, strong growth and low costs will continue to increase India's attractiveness to international investors.
Weaknesses
Hard caps and onerous approval processes will remain in place for some important sectors, such as multi-brand retail, banking, pensions and media. The country will face intense competition for FDI from emerging markets in South-east Asia, many of whom offer more mature incentives than India. The impact of liberalisation efforts will filter through slowly, owing in part to excessive bureaucratic red tape, as well as overhanging impediments in areas related to land acquisition and labour laws. India's slow and onerous judicial system will continue to undermine investor confidence.
What to watch- Given the geopolitical tensions between India and China in recent years, there has been heightened scrutiny of Chinese investment and business operation in India. The Indian government will limit the scope and reach of investment from China as much as possible, and these companies will be exposed to some stringent observation to ensure adherence to Indian FDI rules.
- A gradual pick-up in foreign investment in the renewable energy sector will take place in the forecast period, as India seeks more climate-friendly investments to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by2070. Solar and wind energy projects will be the major areas for investment.

The labour market Overview
India's labour market score improves, pushing up its global ranking by 18 places and regional ranking to 10th; the latter surpassing Vietnam, Indonesia and South Korea. Improvement in the forecast period will stem from a higher-quality labour force, particularly in terms of skills and health outcomes, albeit from a weak starting point, as well as a less challenging cost of living environment, which will keep wage growth modest. The country's historically strict labour laws were materially streamlined in 2019-20.
Strengths
India boasts a young demographic with a lower median age than China, promising good availability of labour. There is a healthy supply of low-to-semi-skilled workers and the cost of hiring locally is cheap by global standards. Companies operating in states that have adopted simplified labour codes will face easier compliance by ensuring a single licensing mechanism for industries; they also provide operational flexibility for small and medium-sized enterprises. These companies have also introduced faster dispute-resolution mechanisms. With minimum-wage norms not being prevalent across Indian industries, the cost of labour, particularly for low-end manufacturing, is likely to remain modest.
Weaknesses
A low participation rate remains a weakness, as it consistently falls short of 50%, below peer economies, mainly because female participation in the labour force remains low. Educational attainment is uneven by region and gender. There is also a gap between academia and the industry, which businesses need to invest in training and skill development programmes.
What to watch- Labour force participation is expected to increase in the coming years as society adapts to new norms and participation of women in the labour force improves across levels. This will ensure an abundant supply of labour in the market and will keep inflationary pressures on wage costs low.

Infrastructure Overview
India's score in the infrastructure category improves from 4.3 to 5.5 in the forecast period, on the back of a relatively broad-based improvement in digital and physical infrastructure through substantial government-led investment. Consequently, India rises by seven positions in the global ranking, and by two places in the regional ranking, overtaking Vietnam and the Philippines. We expect India to make strides in construction and the upgrade of roads and highways in 2024-28 and—to a lesser extent—air and sea transport infrastructure, leading to an overall improvement in infrastructural availability. Supply of power will also be more reliable in the forecast period as coal offtake and throughput increase.
Strengths
The BJP-led government has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving infrastructure across India. In the past few years budget allocation towards infrastructure-related capital spending has nearly doubled. Flagship initiatives such as Bharatmala (a network of cross-country roads and highways), Sagarmala (connecting and developing port infrastructure), Udaan (the development of regional airports) and the National Infrastructure Pipeline (a set of infrastructure projects to be undertaken by 2025) will progress. Mobile network coverage is high, facilitating internet-based activities.
Weaknesses
Infrastructure projects have historically been plagued by delays and budget overruns, frequently resulting in incomplete projects of substandard quality. Despite expedited government clearances for industrial projects in recent years, difficulties in land acquisition continue to be an obstacle. The public transport network is inadequate and dated, and major cities are plagued with issues like overcrowding and poor maintenance of infrastructure.
What to watch- The government will focus on areas like reliable and consistent electricity supply, intermodal freight transfers, and inland waterways. Industrial corridors being developed across the country will smooth logistical challenges.
- To encourage states to undertake infrastructure development projects, the national government in its budget for 2024/25 has earmarked Rs1.5trn (US$180bn) for long-term interest-free loans to the states. It will seek to attract private-sector investment through viability gap funding, as well as supportive policies and regulations.

Taxes Overview
India's score for this category improves over the forecast period, allowing it to climb three places in the regional ranking, placing it between Bangladesh and Japan. India's tax system is still fairly complex despite persistent attempts to streamline it. However, the tax regime is predictable and stable. The tax net excludes a large number of people working in the informal sector, which keeps the tax base narrow vis-à-vis the size of the country. However, in recent years the government has used digital avenues to link identity and incomes to taxation dues, thereby expanding the tax base substantially. Tax revenues have steadily climbed over the years. We expect the overall tax system to become more equitable and progressive over time.
Strengths
India's gross tax buoyancy (the ratio of tax growth to GDP growth) has exceeded 1 in recent years, showing a significant rise in taxation levels, especially since the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, which harmonised indirect taxes and created a more unified national single market. The top marginal tax rate for individuals will remain competitive at 30% in the forecast period. In its budget for 2024/25 the government sanctioned tax cuts to boost manufacturing investment in key industries such as electronics, solar cells and panels, and the jewellery sector (an important export sector).
Weaknesses
Tax enforcement is weak and inconsistent, but more standardised tax collection and a crackdown on grey areas are likely to mean a higher tax burden for many businesses. The taxation system is also prone to endemic corruption, which further heightens compliance risks. Tax filing remains a complex task. Under the GST, an inverted duty structure persists, wherein inputs are taxed at a higher rate than the final good or service.
What to watch- To incentivise foreign businesses and investors to manufacture in India, the government has lowered the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40% to 35%. We believe that the policy measure will facilitate increasing foreign investment into the country.
- The GST Council will continue to take measures to simplify the tax system and streamline rates in the forecast period. Specifically, a rationalisation of GST rates could take the form of more items moving into lower tax brackets. Several key items, including petroleum products, will remain outside the GST coverage.

Business environment rankings Overview
India's overall score in EIU's business environment ranking rises to 6.6 in 2025-29, from 5.5 in 2020-24, propelling the country's rise in global and regional ranks. Regional peers Malaysia and Thailand still rank higher than India, but India will overtake the Philippines, Vietnam and China in the quality of business environment. The biggest improvements will stem from continued efforts on trade liberalisation, foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitation and infrastructure and technological upgrades and robust financial markets.
Strengths
India's main strengths are market opportunities and the macroeconomic environment, which has sustained strong growth. India is the only single-country market that offers a potential scale comparable to that of China. Alongside intrinsic capabilities including solid economic fundamentals, a sound digital infrastructure and favourable demographics, qualified policy support to attract manufacturing investment is available.
Weaknesses
The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition's reduced parliamentary majority will stymie the enactment of bold factor reforms related to land and labour, which will sour business appetite. Decades of underfunding has led to insufficient transport and logistical infrastructure, which will continue to prevent the economy from reaching its full potential. However, significant public investment has been made in this area in recent years, and the outlook is constructive. India's political environment will remain a constraint, as bureaucracy and red tape persist, and policy inconsistency at a federal level remains, making the policy environment across states heterogeneous.
What to watch- Policymaking in certain areas like labour reforms, privatisation, asset monetisation and data privacy norms, among others, will be protracted and unpredictable as the considerably reduced majority of the NDA will weaken its ability to enact legislation on its own terms, and adhere to coalition requirements. Parliamentary gridlock on business reforms will weigh on investor confidence.
- India will gradually seal bilateral trade deals with more countries such as the UK, Oman, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as multilateral treaties with regional blocs such as the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council, by the end of our forecast period, which will widen India's export markets.



Macroeconomic environment Overview
India's score for the macroeconomic environment category rises from 6.9 to 7.8 in 2024-28, placing it higher in the regional ranking than Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The country's macroeconomic environment will remain resilient, characterised by robust GDP growth. India is largely a domestic-driven economy, which makes it less exposed to external financial and demand-related shocks, although it will intermittently be affected by commodity-related supply-chain disruptions. The economy will display strong growth by emerging-market standards, continued fiscal consolidation and low financial market volatility, which will support the score. The external sector will benefit from consistently strong export growth, but the current account will remain in deficit throughout the forecast period.
Strengths
India's economic growth will remain strong compared to most emerging-market peers, at just below 6.5% per year over the forecast period—one of the fastest growing major economies. India's improving income levels and aspirational population will create significant market opportunities, underpinning its attractiveness for foreign investment inflows. Continued fiscal consolidation, deep foreign-exchange reserves and the low exposure to exchange-rate risks of the government debts (they are largely domestically owned) will ensure solid debt repayment capacities.
Weaknesses
The twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will persist, keeping the domestic currency on a depreciatory trend over much of the forecast period. Inflation will intermittently arise as a problem owing to a lack of supply-chain resilience to extreme weather conditions. India's significant import dependence for petroleum, gold, raw materials and machinery will also continue, keeping it susceptible to global supply-chain disruptions.
What to watch- Internationalisation of the rupee will gradually pick up speed. This will mitigate exchange-rate volatility, reduce the current-account deficit and incentivise foreign investment inflows.
- The government will pursue an aggressive fiscal consolidation plan over the forecast period and will successfully meet its target of narrowing the budget deficit to under 4.5% of GDP by fiscal year 2025/26 (April-March). Healthy growth in tax receipts, as well as the transfer of large bounties from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank), will enable fiscal consolidation, which will, in turn, reduce market borrowing needs and buoy debt markets.

Strengths Given the extent of tax evasion and avoidance there is plenty of scope in Italy to widen the tax base, close the tax gap (between potential and actual revenue), and shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour. According to Eurostat, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base for low-wage earners), at 43.5% in 2022, compared with the euro zone average of 38.4%. In May 2023 the Italian government approved a decree law including measures to increase labour market flexibility, with a moderate easing of restrictions on fixed-term contracts; reduce labour taxes; improve active labour policies; and change social-welfare benefits to incentivise people who are out of work to seek employment.

Full text: Overview
Italy's low score for taxation remains unchanged in the forecast period, resulting in falls in the country's global and regional ranking. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, we expect the tax system to remain complex, making compliance costly and time-consuming for private-sector companies. Despite a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017, Italy's standard rate of corporate tax is relatively high, at 24%. In 2020 the government introduced a 3% "digital services tax" on multinational companies. This tax was replaced in 2024 by the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed in 2021. According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue as a share of GDP (including social-security contributions) stood at 42.5% in 2023, broadly unchanged compared with the previous three years. The euro zone average in 2022 (latest available data) was 41.9%, according to Eurostat, unchanged from 2021.
Strengths
Given the extent of tax evasion and avoidance there is plenty of scope in Italy to widen the tax base, close the tax gap (between potential and actual revenue), and shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour. According to Eurostat, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base for low-wage earners), at 43.5% in 2022, compared with the euro zone average of 38.4%. At 16% in 2022, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU.
Weaknesses
The tax system is complex, varies across regions and goes through frequent changes. Tax evasion and avoidance remains widespread in Italy, having been encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, the limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. In addition to Italy's high corporation tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Company social-security contribution rates are also high by international comparison, at up to 30% (about 9% for employees, down from about 9.5% as a result of measures adopted in the 2024 budget). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest rates in Europe), is significantly reduced. For the 2022 tax year the number of personal income-tax brackets was cut from five to four. In 2024 the number was cut to just three, with a view to eventually extending the flat-tax regime available to the self-employed to employees. The marginal personal income-tax rate has been kept at 43% on gross annual incomes of more than €50,000 (€75,000 up to 2021).
What to watch- The personal income tax changes in the 2024 budget, which benefited low-earners, were only funded for one year. If they are to remain in place in 2025 and beyond, additional savings will be needed from spending cuts or other tax increases. The government's room for manoeuvre in the 2025 budget will be extremely limited.
- The NRRP contains measures to improve the tax administration, simplify the tax system and reduce evasion, but implementing such reforms will be challenging. We expect the tax burden to remain high owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements.

Macroeconomic environment Overview
Italy's macroeconomic environment score and rankings improve in the forecast period, reflecting slowing inflation and a narrowing of the budget deficit. However, the government still faces major macroeconomic policy challenges, including supporting investment and employment, raising productivity, putting public debt on a sustainable downward path, and making policies more socially inclusive. Monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2022-23 to combat the surge in inflation caused government bond yields to rise and risk premiums to widen, pushing up government borrowing costs. The start of an easing cycle in June 2024 should help gradually to reduce interest payments on Italy's government debt during the forecast period.
Strengths
Measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are planned under Italy's NRRP, but implementation is likely to remain a challenge. The ECB has instruments at its disposal to avoid a further sharp rise in financial fragmentation risk in the euro area. We expect the bank to intervene, if necessary, to help to contain a further rise in government borrowing costs for heavily indebted countries such as Italy.
Weaknesses
Despite some progress in recent years, economic reforms have generally been introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and implementation has remained an issue. Although the deficit is expected to narrow during the forecast period, it is still large, and Italy's government debt to GDP ratio remains one of the highest in the euro area.
What to watch- The size of the country's public debt and its record of weak government effectiveness will continue to be causes of concern for Italy's EU partners, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector. Room for manoeuvre will be limited in the 2025 budget following the European Commission's recommendation to open excessive-deficit procedures against Italy and several other EU countries.
- Despite some delays, as at end-2023 Italy had already received €102bn from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) out of a total €194.4bn (€71.8bn in grants and €122.6bn in loans). At the time of writing the Commission was assessing Italy's application for a fifth tranche worth almost €11bn. The remainder of the funds are due to be drawn down in five more tranches under a tight timeframe, with all "milestones" (qualitative objectives) and "targets" (quantitative goals) having to be completed by August 2026.

The labour market Overview
Italy's global ranking deteriorates by five places in the forecast period, as we expect the country to continue to perform poorly in the labour market category, especially compared with its EU peers. In May 2023 the Italian government approved a decree law including measures to increase labour market flexibility, with a moderate easing of restrictions on fixed-term contracts; reduce labour taxes; improve active labour policies; and change social-welfare benefits to incentivise people who are out of work to seek employment. However, the measures are limited so are unlikely to have any lasting positive impact on Italy's labour market performance. The high level of pension spending in Italy will keep social-security contributions high, curbing employment growth.
Strengths
Labour market reform is a major component of Italy's NRRP. However, rather than focus on contracts, as past reforms have largely done, it will seek to improve job activation schemes, as well as the retraining and upskilling of workers, increasing the effectiveness of the national employment agency, and improving education outcomes.
Weaknesses
The shortcomings that persist in the Italian labour market leave it particularly vulnerable to severe economic and social disruption in the event of another economic downturn. Despite the gap narrowing, Italy's headline jobless rate remains above the euro area average. Youth unemployment also remains particularly high at about 20%, the fifth highest in the euro area. Italian labour market participation also remains low, particularly among women and young people, and fell sharply during the pandemic. Italy's employment rate was 66.3% in 2023, above its pre-pandemic average of 63.5% in 2019 but well below the euro area average of 74.7%. The female employment rate averaged 56.5% in Italy (69.8% in the euro area).
What to watch- We expect sectoral wage bargaining between unions and employers' associations at the national level to continue to determine wage levels and employment conditions. Negotiations can be protracted, however, resulting in many contracts expiring well before they can be renewed, contributing to industrial unrest.
- The social partners agreed in 2018 to implement second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains, but progress in this area was halted during the pandemic, and such plans will face resistance.

Financing Overview
Italy's score improves in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation in the banking sector, support recapitalisation, and tackle the issue of high non-performing loans (NPLs) accumulated following the global and euro zone sovereign debt crises. NPLs have declined considerably. At 2.7% of total credit at the end of the first quarter of 2024 the ratio is well below the peak of 18.2% in 2015, but still above the EU average of just under 2%. A system of guarantees (the garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) introduced in 2016 contributed significantly to the decline and the emergence of a secondary market for NPLs. The scheme expired in July 2022, after several extensions approved by the European Commission. However, since taking office in late 2022, the Meloni government has shown at times limited awareness of the potentially negative effects of its policies on the financial system. In late 2023 financial market fallout forced the government to backtrack on a planned one-off additional tax of 40% on banks' extra profits earned from higher interest rates. The government also came in for widespread criticism over measures also announced in late 2023 to allow households and small businesses to buy back NPLs at a discounted price to improve their creditworthiness. The Financial Stability Board and the ECB have both warned that the measures risk undermining the functioning of the NPL market. Italy's large number of small and medium-sized firms continue to rely heavily on bank borrowing for financing.
Strengths
The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2023 included eight Italian banks: Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), Banco BPM, Mediobanca, BPER, Iccrea Banca (Istituto Centrale del Credito Cooperativo) and Cassa Centrale Banca-Credito Cooperativo Italiano. Under the adverse scenario, the most severe in recent rounds of testing, Italian banks performed better on average than those in the EU, with a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5% by 2025, a fall of 351 basis points from end-2022. In the EU as a whole the fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 10.4% in 2025, a fall of 459 basis points. MPS, which was the worst-performing bank in the bloc in the 2021 stress tests, showed a marked improvement, with its fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio falling by 551 basis points to a still-solid 10.1% in 2025.
Weaknesses
Progress towards consolidation in the sector has been slow, but the successful takeover in 2020 of UBI Banca, Italy's sixth-largest bank, by Intesa Sanpaolo, the second largest, suggests that a new wave of bank mergers and acquisitions is likely during the forecast period. However, government efforts to encourage one of Italy's main banks to take over its stake in MPS have so far been unsuccessful. Having rescued MPS, Italy's fifth-largest bank at the time, at a cost of €5.4bn in late 2016 when it came close to collapse, the Italian state has injected further capital while the bank's new management implements a fresh restructuring plan before trying again to sell the bank.
What to watch- The resilience of the financial sector will be tested by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, followed by the cost-of-living and energy crises. An array of support policies at the disposal of the ECB, as well as domestic stimulus measures by the government and the Bank of Italy, has helped to bolster liquidity and hold down banks' funding costs.
- A renewed increase in loan losses amid higher unemployment and business failures and bouts of global financial market volatility could put pressure on individual lenders' balance sheets, potentially exposing areas of weakness and curbing lending as the economic recovery slows.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and the justice system. Political pressure has generally limited the effectiveness of Italy's regulatory bodies. EU directives have generally been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy, transport and professional services. Italy's current right-wing government has indicated that it will reduce the state's stakes in a range of companies, including the post office, Poste Italiane; the energy group Eni (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi); and the state railway company. However, the sales are designed to generate revenue to reduce government debt rather than boost competition in the affected sectors.
Strengths
In 2021 the previous government, led by Mario Draghi, a former governor of the Bank of Italy (the central bank) and president of the ECB, introduced new out-of-court procedures for business restructuring. This should help to accelerate the process, with the courts intervening only in the event of a failure to reach an agreement between the debtor and creditors.
Weaknesses
Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent to foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases were introduced in the previous parliament. However, political opposition and resistance to change remain strong in the judicial system, which is likely to hamper implementation. Implementation is also likely to be an issue without an overhaul of the public administration. As with past reform plans, aspects of the 2022 competition bill faced strong opposition within some political circles and business associations. Following the collapse of the Draghi government, the bill was diluted. The new bankruptcy code adopted in early 2019 represents a major improvement, but it only came into force in part in mid-July 2022, with safeguarding procedures delayed until end-2023.
What to watch- Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the state-owned development bank, already has sizeable stakes in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates Eni and Enel; Italy's electricity transmission company, Terna; the shipbuilder Fincantieri; and Poste Italiane. We expect CDP's role in the economy to expand further, as it is increasingly being used to rescue struggling Italian firms and represent the state's interests in companies deemed to be of "strategic" importance. However, its efforts since the beginning of 2023 to reach a deal with Italy's TIM, which is majority owned by Vivendi, a French telecoms group, to buy the former state company's fixed-line network have so far failed.
- An agreement reached between the European Commission and the Italian government in 2021 allowed a new company, Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA Airways), to be carved out of Italy's loss-making national carrier, the formerly state-owned Alitalia, after more than four years in administration. However, since then the Italian airline and its minority shareholder, Lufthansa, have been embroiled in an EU state aid case brought by a rival budget airline, Ryanair. At present, it appears that an agreement will be reached to drop the case in exchange for ITA relinquishing some of its slots at Milan's Linate airport. This will increase competition on long- and short-haul flights at the airport, where ITA is the dominant airline.

Foreign trade and exchange controls Overview
Italy's score in this category improves in the forecast period, leading to substantial improvements in its global and regional rankings. The improvement reflects our expectation of a moderation of the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis on global trade and supply-chains, to which Italy has been particularly vulnerable. The country's foreign trade regime is largely defined by its EU membership. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU; most non-tariff restrictions have been abolished; and administrative costs related to cross-border trade are low. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). All of these arrangements exclude agriculture. Trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties, with bilateral and regional agreements providing for lower or zero tariffs, as well as co-operation on non tariff barriers. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market, particularly China, will encourage greater trade diversification.
Strengths
The EU remains committed to the WTO and its dispute arbitration procedures. As support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed the EU has shifted its focus towards negotiating bilateral trade deals. These include agreements with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and New Zealand, an upgrade of its deal with Mexico, and the launch of trade talks with Indonesia. However, after five years of negotiations with Australia, talks collapsed over terms of access to the EU agricultural market in October 2023.
Weaknesses
The global trade environment has deteriorated as a result of protectionist sentiment and a moderate slowdown of world trade growth. An as yet unresolved appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body since late 2019 has undermined the effectiveness of the multilateral trade system.
What to watch- On the assumption that Joe Biden wins the US presidential election in November 2024, trade relations between Europe and the US are likely to remain unchanged. However, big shifts on trade policy would be likely under Donald Trump. The Republican front-runner has said that he will impose a 10% tariff on all imports—compared with average tariffs of less than 3% on EU imports at present. Although imposing such a blanket tariff would face congressional hurdles, there could be a rise in tariffs targeting some particular sectors. These could include tariffs on automotive imports, which Mr Trump backed away from in 2019, but may want to revive. The other big risk is that the US decides not to agree to or implement the OECD global tax deal, gets hit by the EU digital services tax (as these have been put on hold while this deal is finalised) and chooses to retaliate with a new array of tariffs.
- If fully implemented, the provisional EU trade agreement with Mercosur, the South American trading bloc, following 20 years of talks would create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people. However, owing to opposition in some EU member states to aspects of the deal (mostly related to agriculture and climate), the ratification process has stalled, and we do not expect it to be completed in the forecast period.

Technological readiness Overview
Italy's technological readiness score and rankings improve in the forecast period, partly driven by measures contained in the NRRP, including digitalisation of public services. During the pandemic, growth in e-commerce accelerated, to 34.8% year on year in value terms in 2020, moderating to 13.4% in 2021, 6.4% in 2022, 4.7% in 2023 and 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024, according to Istat. However, this was from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales in 2019 (compared with about 20% in the UK). According to the European Patent Office, after declining by about 1% in 2022, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy rose by 3.8% in 2023—compared with an annual average increase of 1.8% in Europe as a whole—but accounted for only 5.9% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at 85.3 per 1m population, ranking Italy 18th—well behind other major European economies such as Germany and France, but almost on a par with the UK and well ahead of Spain.
Strengths
Mobile-phone penetration is among the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive.
Weaknesses
Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D), has risen gradually since the beginning of the 2000s but is low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. Total R&D spending was the equivalent of just under 1.5% of GDP in 2021, according to the OECD, compared with an OECD average of 2.7%. Italy ranks as a "moderate innovator" in the European Innovation Scoreboard 2023. Its performance relative to the EU has improved since 2016, but its score declined sharply in 2023 from 2022.
What to watch- We expect a slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base.
- Italy's NRRP has earmarked total EU funds of about €21bn for investments in research and innovation to be spent by late 2026. The projects focus mainly on enhancing research structures with the creation of national research centres; improving researchers' skills, particularly in the fields of digital technologies and ecological transition; and facilitating more collaboration between businesses and universities.

Policy towards foreign investment Overview
Italy's score and rankings for policy towards foreign investment deteriorate in the forecast period. FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. Hardening sentiment at the EU level towards foreign takeovers and non-EU inward FDI—with a particular focus on inflows from China—has resulted in tighter regional screening provisions since 2017. On the back of deteriorating EU-China political relations, the Meloni government announced in late 2023 that Italy would withdraw from the 2019 Memorandum of Understanding with China to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative—China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan—when it came up for renewal in 2024.
Strengths
The main strength of Italy's business sector has been its many family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies, which specialise in products that require high-quality design and engineering as well as luxury and high-end goods.
Weaknesses
The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to its bureaucratic and legal complexities, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Past labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and the streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues. However, given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU countries.
What to watch- The impact of the Ukraine crisis and Gaza conflict on international trade and the prices of energy and other commodities, as well as higher interest rates compared with historical averages, will weigh heavily on firms' balance sheets and equity valuations. This is likely to renew foreign interest in acquisitions of Italian companies.
- The current right-wing government's populist tendencies are likely to make Italy less open to foreign investment, especially in sectors that it considers "strategic", such as energy and telecoms.

Infrastructure Overview
As reflected in Italy's relatively low score in this category and its decline in the global and regional rankings, the quality of its infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment over the past 25-30 years, and corruption investigations and opposition from local interest groups have been a relatively common reason for blocking or delaying several major projects. Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in the transport and energy sectors, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.
Strengths
Backed by EU recovery funds, Italy's NRRP focuses on a wide range of infrastructure investments in areas such as sustainable energy and transport, as well as in the digital economy, including the deployment of ultra-fast broadband, and 5G and satellite technology. It remains to be seen how effective implementation and monitoring of the investments will be during the forecast period. The collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in 2018 highlighted the urgent need for maintenance of existing infrastructure. However, the reconstruction of the bridge in record time (it reopened in July 2020) highlights that when there is political will to overcome bureaucratic obstacles there is ample scope for improvement in Italy's performance.
Weaknesses
Successive governments have promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt-servicing costs, combined with competing demands within coalition governments, have made a radical change in policy direction difficult. Limited domestic energy sources, popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation and the Ukraine crisis will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor energy distribution infrastructure will also keep upward pressure on costs in the medium term. Investment projects in the sector are also likely to continue to face strong local resistance.
What to watch- Building a high-speed broadband network across the country has been a policy priority of successive Italian governments. Progress has been extremely slow so far, but the NRRP's focus on the need to accelerate Italy's digital transition may provide some much-needed momentum.
- Central to Italy's high-speed broadband investment plan has been a proposed merger of the network assets of Open Fiber, a wholesale broadband operator jointly owned by Enel and CDP, and TIM (formerly Telecom Italia), but resistance from TIM's largest shareholder, Vivendi, a French telecoms group, has been strong. The merger would help to speed the rollout and avoid unnecessary duplication. However, there is some concern that it would also stifle competition.

Business environment rankings Overview
EIU expects a small improvement in Italy's business environment score during the forecast period (2025-29). However, the country falls by four places in the global ranking and by one place to second from bottom, ahead of just Turkey in western Europe, in the regional ranking.
Strengths
Score improvements have resulted in rises in Italy's global rankings for the macroeconomic environment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and technological readiness. Several of the improvements reflect the impact of modest economic reforms by successive governments since late 2011 and the implementation of some of the reforms and investments contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP). The plan gives the government access to substantial financial support from the EU.
Weaknesses
Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, policy towards private enterprise and competition, taxes, and the labour market. Previous reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact. Implementation of the NRRP will remain challenging as a result of weak administrative capacity, especially at the local government level.
What to watch- The current government is phasing in wide-ranging changes to the tax system, but we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment and constrain efforts to improve the country's public finances. Evasion will remain widespread, despite past efforts to improve compliance.
- Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans on their balance sheets has made progress. Nevertheless, resistance to consolidation in the sector is likely to continue.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: The ruling right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) has a majority of about 60% of the parliamentary seats. This will continue to allow the government to easily pass legislation in parliament throughout its term without much obstacle.
2027-29: Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, remains in power until 2027 and possibly beyond. Ms Meloni maintains Italy's support for Ukraine against Russia. However, there is a risk that her previously Eurosceptic stance will re-emerge over time, especially if her popularity wanes.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: Economic activity in Italy benefits from a recovery in households' purchasing power (on the back of easing financing conditions and positive real wage growth) and external demand.
2027-29: Growth remains above the pre-pandemic trend, driven by steady growth in private consumption, and EU-funded investment. However, comprehensive reforms in areas that are crucial to addressing the country's structural weaknesses and enhancing its growth potential are unlikely.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. Private consumption per head in Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany.
2027-29: Income levels continue to differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 55% of that in the north. Demographic trends have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The ruling coalition has strong populist tendencies and is sceptical about measures to enhance competition.
2027-29: Improvement in competition policy is unlikely, but ad hoc interventions in sectors that the coalition parties consider politically favourable are possible.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: Modest reductions in red tape. Government imposes penalties on foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2027-29: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: Pressure on export sector from supply-chain and trade shocks increases as a result of rising protectionism, EU-China trade tensions, and the likely imposition of US tariffs on EU imports under a Donald Trump administration.
2027-29: Recognition of risks of supply-chain over-reliance on a single market encourages trade diversification.
Taxes
2025-26: Personal and corporate tax reform plans of the Meloni government prove difficult to implement. Several banks opt out of payment of a one-off levy on additional bank profits earned in 2023 (0.1% of their assets).
2027-29: If implemented, 15% global minimum corporate tax rate replaces "digital tax" on foreign multinational firms.
Financing
2025-26: After raising interest rates sharply in 2022-23 to curb inflation and starting a monetary easing cycle in mid 2024, the European Central Bank continues to loosen monetary policy.
2027-29: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign persists. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market
2025-26: Citizens' income abolished in 2024, replaced by new anti-poverty scheme; pension reforms partly reinstated.
2027-29: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure
2025-26: Bureaucratic obstacles constrain government plans for higher investment spending. Increased investment in energy infrastructure to boost security and diversification of supply.
2027-29: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keeps research and development (R&D) spending low.
2027-29: Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Country Forecast Philippines 15 Oct 2024 (T06:16)

Abstract: Despite a relatively low level of GDP per head compared to ASEAN peers, favourable demographics and resilient economic growth spurs expansion of the retail sector. 2027-29: The reduction in corporate income tax rates in 2020 did not make the country competitive overnight; the Philippines still has some of the highest tax rates in the region. The Ease of Paying Taxes Act, signed into law in January 2024, necessitates the issuance of a value-added tax (VAT) invoice for every transaction (with concessions for micro and small firms, such as lower penalties and shorter tax returns). The Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform Act, signed in June 2024, should boost compliance with property taxes.

Full text: Overview
The score for the foreign trade and exchange controls category will remain at 7.8 in the forecast period. The absence of forward movement means that the Philippines’ global ranking will drop by five spots to 53rd, while its position in Asia will fall by one, to 11th.
Strengths
The country's profile is bolstered by its general openness to trade, and the peso will continue to be freely convertible for current-account and most capital-account transactions. Trade barriers are more likely to be lowered than raised, owing to external dependence. This was exhibited in June 2024, when Mr Marcos approved a large reduction in import tariffs for the staple food, rice, from 35% to 15% for five years.
Weaknesses
The Philippines' main weakness is its partially closed capital account. Constitutional barriers to foreign investment, in particular, are likely to remain in some form throughout the forecast period and beyond, even if some partial reforms are approved next year.
What to watch- Formal negotiations over an FTA with the EU resumed in March 2024 and should make meaningful progress in 2024-28. Bilateral relations have undergone a positive reset since the end of the Duterte administration, which was chastised by the EU for alleged human-rights abuses. An FTA is vital for EU market access, as the Philippines will not enjoy preferential access once it graduates from lower-middle-income status (which could happen in 2028, based on recent growth trends).
- The government will continue to lower tariffs in line with the RCEP. This took effect for the Philippines in June 2023, but it will take time for the benefits to materialise fully, because of variations in the tariff-reduction schedule and the extremely long timeframes for the most protected sectors. Still, the agreement is expected to lower rates on 98% of goods.
- The Philippines is likely to seek even more ambitious bilateral FTAs in 2024-28, even with countries that have shared RCEP links. The FTA signed with South Korea in September 2023 is a case in point, as the deal includes provisions—absent from the ASEAN-South Korea FTA—that will specifically benefit Philippine agriculture.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: The incumbent administration headed by the president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, retains solid support in the Senate and House of Representatives following the mid-term elections held in May 2025.
2027-29: Tensions within the ruling coalition present challenges for the government in passing substantive legislation.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: High government expenditure ahead of the elections supports growth but hampers fiscal consolidation efforts.
2027-29: GDP grows at an average annual rate of 5.9% in 2025-29, slightly below its pre-pandemic (2015-19) trend of 6.5%.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Despite a relatively low level of GDP per head compared to ASEAN peers, favourable demographics and resilient economic growth spurs expansion of the retail sector.
2027-29: Policies aimed at market liberalisation lead to greater participation of foreign businesses in retail sectors.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The Electronic Business One-Stop Shop system (eBOSS) is rolled out further by more local government units, but progress remains highly uneven and slow.
2027-29: State-owned and politically connected family-run conglomerates continue to play a big role at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: The economy starts to see the benefits of 100% foreign ownership in railways, airports, expressways and telecommunications. The 13th Foreign Investment Negative List is published.
2027-29: Foreign direct investment remains low compared to the country's regional peers, owing to slow progress on the liberalisation of investment restrictions via constitutional reforms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: Negotiations on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership gain momentum, and trade barriers towards the region are lowered in line with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership's provisions.
2027-29: Talks for a free-trade agreement with the EU reach the final stages, before a change in government.
Taxes
2025-26: A new value-added tax on digital services is introduced, as well as an excise tax on single-use plastics. Corporate and personal-income tax rates remain unchanged. The Strategic Investment Priority Plan is published.
2027-29: The administration takes steps to improve compliance and enforce tax evasion laws more strongly. Corporate tax rates will remain high compared to ASEAN peers, despite the recent reforms.
Financing
2025-26: The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank) resumes its push for the consolidation of small and rural banks to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the weak financial sector, while the structural reduction in high reserve requirements resumes.
2027-29: The trend of bank consolidation and mergers intensifies amid rising competition from peers from other South-east Asian countries, following the deepening of regional economic integration in the services sector. New digital bank licenses are offered, following the current moratorium.
The labour market
2025-26: The upward pressure on minimum wage rates remains acute, owing to the cost-of-living crisis in 2022-23.
2027-29: A "brain drain" remains a major constraint to business expansion. Greater demand for skilled engineers and construction workers for infrastructure projects elevates the likelihood of wage inflation in this industry.
Infrastructure
2025-26: The Cavite-Laguna Expressway project is completed and work begins for the Southern Access Link Expressway.
2027-29: The administration continues to push for private investment in infrastructure development, while financing via the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund gains momentum. The New Manila International Airport begins construction.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Policies will be enacted to encourage the use of mobile payment systems. The rollout of 5G services progresses.
2027-29: Internet broadband infrastructure becomes more reliable in the capital, Manila, and is extended to rural areas. Use of the eGovPH platform for public services becomes more widespread.
Taxes Overview
The Philippines' score for taxes will improve to 6.8 in the forecast period, from 6.3 in 2019-23, moving the country up to 38th globally, from 40th. However, the increase in score will not be enough to prevent a marginal drop in the country's regional ranking, from tenth to 11th. The improvement will be due in large part to the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) initiative, which reduces the corporate tax rate and rationalises fiscal incentives. The rate was lowered from 30% to 25% from 2020, and SMEs benefit from a rate of 20%. The rate levied on foreign companies will fall in stages to a terminal rate of 20% by 2027, enabling fair competition.
Strengths
Policy is likely to remain largely predictable in the forecast period, following the major reforms pursued by the previous government. The finance secretary attached himself to his predecessor's pledge to introduce no "new" taxes apart from those that were under discussion prior to the start of the Marcos administration. Predictability in terms of fiscal incentives is enshrined in the CREATE Act; the president has the authority to apply preferential tax measures for a period of up to 40 years. The top marginal rate of personal income tax, at 35%, is relatively high by regional standards but still attractive globally. The same description is applicable to employers' social security obligations; companies currently have to contribute 9.5%, following a one-percentage-point rise in 2023.
Weaknesses
The main components holding back the score relate to incentives for investment and the fairness and complexity of the tax system—issues that recent tax reforms have only partially addressed. Owing in part to the complexity of the rules, alongside the high level of corruption and inadequate enforcement, there remains a need to widen the tax base and boost compliance. The reduction in corporate income tax rates in 2020 did not make the country competitive overnight; the Philippines still has some of the highest tax rates in the region. In the early part of the forecast period, at least, more generous fiscal incentives for investment are likely to be held back, with the budget deficit still over-extended.
What to watch- The main efforts to watch will be implementation of reform focussed on improving compliance. The Ease of Paying Taxes Act, signed into law in January 2024, necessitates the issuance of a value-added tax (VAT) invoice for every transaction (with concessions for micro and small firms, such as lower penalties and shorter tax returns). The Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform Act, signed in June 2024, should boost compliance with property taxes. It will offer a two-year amnesty on penalties for unpaid property taxes. Another area of interest is whether the fourth package under the previous government's Comprehensive Tax Reform Programme is pushed through. This element would simplify taxes on passive income and other financial instruments.
- The most likely broadening of the tax base will come in the form of VAT on digital transactions, such as payments for streaming. In May 2024 the upper house unanimously approved a bill imposing 12% VAT on such services, even if the service provider does not have a physical presence domestically. Failure to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to remit the VAT collected could result in the local blockage or suspension of their service. A few key sectors are exempt, however, such as education and banking and non-banking financial intermediation. The bill is now awaiting the president's signature; a similar proposal was approved by the lower house in 2022.
- The next iteration of the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP), due in 2025, will outline any changes to fiscal incentives. At its most basic level, the SIPP lists the areas that are eligible for incentives. Generally, the most favourable terms are offered to export-oriented companies and those that are located outside the capital—a guiding principle that is unlikely to change.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
The Philippines’ score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will rise modestly in the forecast period, from 4.5 in 2019-23 to 4.8. Faster improvements elsewhere will push down its global and regional rank to 65th and 13th, respectively, from 58th and 11th. The improvement will stem from better protections for minority shareholders, although the bar for any progress on this is very low. Such gains should be anchored by the country's efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, a free-trade bloc), as well as the formal resumption of negotiations in March 2024 for an FTA with the EU. Improvement will be offset partially by greater state control over certain parts of the economy in 2024-28.
Strengths
In recent years the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued regulations, enhancing minority shareholders' powers and rights and protection of private property remains one of the country's strengths, together—albeit to a smaller extent—with the freedom of businesses to compete and the level of government regulation. Ongoing efforts to reduce red tape include the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, of which the full impact has yet to be realised. The liberalisation envisaged under the ASEAN Economic Community (a single market for members) will continue to create new opportunities.
Weaknesses
Structurally, family-run conglomerates with substantial vested interests will retain strong influence on policymaking, prolonging the sub-optimal environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) will continue to face difficulties in its effort to break down these monopolies and target trust practices.
What to watch- Intra-country trade friction should ease in the forecast period, following an executive order that took effect in September 2023, which suspended the so-called "pass-through fees" that local governments collect when goods transported on national roads cross different jurisdictions.
- The Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act created the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA). ARTA faces internal and external challenges, such as corruption. Progress on one of its key initiatives—the Electronic Business One-Stop Shop (eBOSS)—remains patchy, suggesting poor and uneven enforcement. The system, which aims to automate the process of obtaining business permits, was meant to be rolled out nationwide in 2021. However, as at May 2024, only 35 local government units—out of more than 1,600—have been certified as fully compliant. The government aims to raise this count to 200 in 2024.
- The Philippine Competition Commission will remain critical in the forecast period. Most recently in March 2024, the commission raised the mandatory notification threshold for mergers and acquisitions, making it easier for smaller companies to compete with scale. It has also established "i-Stations" outside the capital, Manila (in Cebu, Davao, Legazpi Cty and Baguino City), to better monitor, investigate and take enforcement action against anti-competitive practices outside the capital, where SMEs are likely to have an even bigger disadvantage.

Macroeconomic environment Overview
The Philippines' score in this category deteriorates to 6.6 in 2024-28, from 6.9 in the historical period, owing solely to a less robust outlook for government debt. This will see its global rank plunge to 52nd, from 37th, while its regional position will slip by one spot, to 13th.
Strengths
The country's strengths lie partly in the quality of its economic institutions and the sound policies that are pursued, as a result. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank), for instance, was one of the most aggressive central banks in the region in terms of its response to the 2022-23 global cost-of-living crisis; it increased its benchmark rate by 450 basis points in total, demonstrating commitment to price stability and maintaining the exchange rate.
Weaknesses
The budget deficit—6.2% of GDP in 2023—remains wide compared with developing Asia and the country's average deficit of 2.4% in 2015-19. The debt/GDP ratio rose to over 60% in 2021 and has remained elevated since then, far above the 2019 level of 42%. We expect only a steady narrowing of the deficit to 4.8% of GDP by 2028.
What to watch- The new finance secretary, Ralph Recto, will follow his predecessors' key commitments, such as narrowing the deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of 2028, while introducing no "new" taxes, apart from those already planned. These include a proposed value-added tax on digital services and an excise tax on single-use plastics. This promise of predictability will be tested during the forecast period, as continued fiscal consolidation amid cooling economic growth and slowing inflation will be much tougher to achieve.
- Mr Marcos will need to expand his efforts in order to maintain the Philippines' reputation for reform that had been garnered under the efforts of previous presidents, Benigno Aquino (fiscal prudence) and Rodrigo Duterte (tax reform, infrastructure investment). Mr Marcos's first two years have seen little in the way of major reform, apart from the establishment of the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund in July 2023, which has yet to be fully capitalised and whose investment plans remain vague and undefined.

Technological readiness Overview
The Philippines’ score for technological readiness will strengthen to 5.8 in the forecast period, from 4.9 in 2019-23, on the back of greater internet penetration, reduced exposure to cyber-security threats and a more conducive climate for research and development. However, the country’s global position will improve by only two spots, to 62nd, while its position in Asia—where competitor countries will make greater strides—will slip by one place, to 12th.
Strengths
Mobile internet access will improve significantly, particularly among younger, urban consumers. Progress will also be noticeable in rural areas, where establishing fixed connectivity remains challenging. The availability of cheap mobile phones remains a big driver; Chinese manufacturers (such as Realme, Transsion, Oppo and Xiaomi) continue to dominate smartphone sales in the country, owing to their cost competitiveness.
Weaknesses
The Philippines' dominant telecoms providers will unveil new mobile infrastructure, but internet speeds will remain among the slowest in the region. The Philippines is also still relatively weak in terms of internet use. The latest data from the International Telecommunication Union show that 53% of the population was using the internet in 2021, below Indonesia's 62% (the fairest regional comparison) and the global average of 63%.
What to watch- The private sector will engage heavily in the implementation of plans to digitalise government services. The eGovPH mobile application was launched in June 2023, providing a one-stop shop for national and local services, such as business registrations and tax payments. Security assessments, the development of central storage and encryption of data will be important in 2024-28, as the usage of this platform grows in tandem with its functionality. The effective implementation of this strategy would reduce the risk of major data breaches, but exposure will remain high compared to the country's regional peers. More than 72m people could use eGovPH to access their digital ID as at May 2024.
- Increased risk of cyber-attacks and new regulations during the forecast period will prompt companies to upgrade their defences, although implementation will be inconsistent across sectors. In the meantime, the threat level in the Philippines will remain acute, partly because of tensions with China over disputed territory in the South China Sea. Resecurity, a US cybersecurity company, found that malicious internet activity against the Philippines increased by more than 300% in the first four months of 2024 from the end of 2023, with most attacks geared towards reducing the public's trust in official government bodies.

Financing Overview
The Philippines' score for financing will remain unchanged in the forecast period, at 5.9. Improvements elsewhere will mean that the country’s global position drops by 15 places, to 61st, while its regional rank will fall from tenth to 12th.
Strengths
Foreign banks are allowed to enter the market with no investment restrictions. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act, passed in 2021, allows banks to sell off non-performing loans (NPLs) to asset-management companies and has helped to lower NPLs. The financial system will become more integrated with the wider ASEAN market. Under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF), a small number of ASEAN banks will be licensed to operate across the bloc. As ABIF operates largely on a bilateral level, however, progress on regional financial integration is likely to remain very uneven.
Weaknesses
The financial sector remains small and simple, with activity concentrated in basic bank and non-bank lending and deposit-taking. The regulatory environment is particularly conservative, especially when it comes to emerging industry trends. In 2021 the BSP shut the door for new digital bank licences for at least three years, to monitor the impact of these institutions. As far as we can surmise, this study is still ongoing; however, the BSP governor, Eli Remolona, stated reassuringly in October 2023 that this moratorium could be lifted in the foreseeable future. At the moment, only six digital banks are in operation.
What to watch- • The central bank will continue to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in 2024 28, structurally releasing more funds to the system. At 9.5%, the Philippines still has one of the highest legally mandatory ratios relative to its regional peers at the same level of development (even though it has been reduced from 20% since 2018). The end goal is to lower the RRR to 5%.

Business environment rankings Overview
As a country with a large and fast-growing market, coupled with a broad-based improvement in its labour market, the Philippines will have an overall score of 6.12 in our forecast period, rising from 5.73 in 2020-24. The likely relaxation of foreign direct investment laws and improved taxation will also help. Faster improvements among peer economies, however, will mean that the country's global rank will fall by two to 58th, while it will remain 12th regionally.
Strengths
Foreign trade, liberal exchange controls and accommodative taxes will remain the country's strong points. The Philippines is more deeply integrated with the regional economy, after it entered the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in mid-2023. The 2021 Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act will help to improve ease-of-doing business, and the Marcos administration has helped to boost compliance.
Weaknesses
Long-standing problems with the country's infrastructure will remain a big drag on the overall score, as well as sub-optimal policy towards private enterprise and competition, owing to the influence of large, monopolistic and politically influential family-run conglomerates. Lack of political stability will remain another major structural weak point.
What to watch- A renewed commitment to free-trade agreements (FTAs) will support positive changes to the score. We expect that the Philippines will seek and complete membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and establish an FTA with the EU in 2025-29.
- Rapid wage growth could be destabilising in the early part of the forecast period, owing to the acute political pressure for substantial minimum wage rises in the aftermath of the global cost-of-living crisis.

The labour market Overview
A broad-based improvement in this area will boost the Philippines’ labour market score substantially to 7.0 in 2024 28, from 5.6 in the historical period. This will boost the country’s global and regional rankings to 17th and fourth respectively, from 58th and 13th. More competitive labour costs, an overall improvement in skills, better health outcomes and a smaller risk of industrial disputes will underpin this material improvement.
Strengths
The country has a large pool of English-speaking surplus labour. The cost of firing workers is lower than in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Minimum wages vary across the country, preventing overly restrictive conditions in less developed areas. Philippine unions have a reputation for militancy, but the rate of unionisation will remain low in 2024-28, with fewer than 5% of workers belonging to a union.
Weaknesses
Skills shortages caused by a "brain drain" remain a long-standing problem, as more than 2m migrant Filipino workers are hired overseas each year. The most popular destinations for migration are the Gulf states and Singapore, although there are substantial flows to countries with historically large Filipino diaspora populations, such as the US. Europe has become a more popular destination in recent years, accounting for over 9% of total overseas foreign workers since 2021 (up from around 6.5% five years previously).
What to watch- The past few years of elevated inflation are likely to exert further upward pressure on wage expectations and on lawmakers to pass further minimum-wage increases. Both houses of the legislature are mulling a proposal for a P100/day increase across the board. Such a raise is unlikely to be as destabilising to the labour market in the capital, Manila, as elsewhere. As at the first quarter of 2024 the rate in the capital (in real terms) was down by 7% from its peak in 2016. The ex-Manila level has risen by 6.5% over the same period.
- The problem of brain drain could intensify in the early years of our forecast period. Indeed, the BSP's data show that overseas placements jumped to a record high of 2.4m in 2023, from 1.2m the year before, surpassing the pre-pandemic peak in 2019 by 475,000.

Policy towards foreign investment Overview
The Philippines' score for policy towards foreign investment will rise to 6.9 in 2024-28, from 6.0 in the historical period. This will push up the country's rank globally from 54th to 48th, but it will not be enough to prevent its regional position from deteriorating from tenth to 12th, because of much faster improvements by its closest competitors. The government's policy towards foreign investment will be more welcome, especially as competition will be fierce within ASEAN and the broader emerging-market sphere for investments that aim to minimise companies' dependence on and exposure to China.
Strengths
Much of the improvement will stem from legislation signed by Mr Duterte just before he left office. This includes amendments to the 2000 Retail Trade Liberalisation Act, the Foreign Investment Act and the Public Investment Act. The most important revisions to the latter include allowing foreign investors to own SMEs with a lower minimum of paid-in capital (US$100,000). The government will enjoy some success in opening up financial services further, anchored by its obligations under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework.
Weaknesses
Significant obstacles to FDI are likely to persist outside the realm of corporate ownership rules, including the ban on foreigners owning land. An element of political risk comes from changes to the Public Investment Act that give the country's president the power to review investments that could threaten national security. Admittedly, this safeguard is reasonable in light of the significant liberalisations made in key sectors; telecommunications, airports, shipping and highways as public service have been opened up to full foreign ownership.
What to watch- Constitutional reform to reduce more entrenched barriers to FDI is back on the agenda, with Mr Marcos considering a proposed referendum to coincide with the 2025 midterm elections. Positive momentum is building; in March 2024 the House of Representatives (the lower house of the Philippines' bicameral parliament) passed Resolution of Both Houses No.7, which would lift constitutional barriers to FDI in utilities, education and advertising. Admittedly, pressure from vested interests (particularly powerful conglomerate families) will continue to complicate the path to charter change, as previous governments have found.
- The authorities will continue to operate the Foreign Investment Negative List system, which specifies the sectors in which participation is restricted. No fixed timetables are set for any changes, but the 13th edition will give an indication of the Marcos administration's priorities in terms of FDI reform. The National Economic and Development Authority stated in January 2024 that the next version would bring a simplification of regulations, at the very least.
- The previous administration's efforts to reopen a few industries—to develop futures streams of revenue for the government—should unlock the door to foreign (and domestic) entrants in 2024-28. These measures include the lifting of a ban on new mines and a moratorium on new casinos.

Infrastructure Overview
The Philippines' infrastructure score will weaken to 4.5 in 2024-28, from 5.0 in the historical period, because of a worsening in relative internet speeds and a material increase in commercial rents. That said, this deterioration will be offset in part by a more reliable electricity supply (albeit from a very low base). The country’s global and regional positions will fall by 15 and five places respectively, to 72nd and 14th.
Strengths
Infrastructure spending has been a key focus for the government since the Duterte administration. Government infrastructure spending rose to about 4.5% of GDP by the end of his term, up from just under 3% when he came into office. Mr Marcos has built on this progress, raising the annual rolling share to 5% of GDP by the first quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, hold-ups in capital spending should be expected, as some projects face lengthy delays from a lethargic bureaucracy and exposure to natural disasters.
Weaknesses
High logistics costs, due to the country's poor road network and ports, and its patchy power supply, will continue to impose high operating costs on businesses. The country also lacks reliable railways, partly as a result of the archipelago's topography. The government will remain highly dependent on bilateral loans and official development assistance to fund projects, at least early in the forecast period, when the fiscal deficit is likely to remain elevated. In a similar vein, the public-private partnership model should continue to account for part of the funding, especially for highway projects. A new channel for funding will be established once the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund is up and running.
What to watch- The government might take control of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Although this could hamper energy efficiency, businesses could benefit from lower energy costs. Fraught relations between the Philippines and China could speed up the takeover of the NGCP, which is currently 40% owned by China's State Grid Corporation.
- Investment into renewable energy will receive renewed support in 2024-28, following the resumption in February 2024 of the collection of feed-in-tariff allowances charged to consumers. Introduced by the 2008 Renewable Energy Act, this charge goes into a fund that helps to pay developers of green energy.
- Major developments in 2024-28 will remain largely focused on transport, where local governments enjoy greater autonomy in the planning stage. The ongoing—and partially opened—P35.7bn Cavite-Laguna Expressway project should be completed by the end of 2024, connecting some of the biggest export-processing zones with ports in Batangas and Manila. In 2022 the previous government signed a toll agreement with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) for the P152.4bn Southern Access Link Expressway, paving the way for its construction. The project is intended in part to provide access to the New Manila International Airport, the construction of which will start in 2026. SMC is also modernising the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, currently the Philippines' main international gateway.

Abstract: The Central Bank of Egypt operates a relatively loose monetary policy under a flexible exchange rate and business confidence improves. The government continues to waver on implementing capital gains tax on stock market transactions, especially after Egypt's extended fund facility with the IMF reduces the incentive to raise revenue. Lending to the private sector is subdued, owing to rising interest rates early in the period. 2027-29: What to watch A critical test of the government's commitment to structural reform will be whether the role of the military establishment in the economy is reduced. [...]far the military has resisted pressures to sell assets and to refrain from using its competitive advantage to dominate important sectors of the economy.

Full text: Overview
Egypt's technological readiness score for the forecast period improves from a low base, owing to expected innovation, driven both by the government and by private ventures. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology will prioritise telecommunications, digital citizenship, human capacity, industry development and innovation. To date progress has been slow, as indicated by Egypt's low ranking in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Global Innovation Index 2024, at 86th out of 131 countries, below Tunisia and Jordan, but above Kenya, Nigeria and Algeria. However, progress is being made in institutional capacity, market sophistication and business complexity, with rapid growth in the financial technology sector.
Strengths
The government envisages the technology sector—including the development of new information and communication technology investment clusters, such as a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone—as a leading driver of economic growth. One of the largest projects in the zone is a plant designed to manufacture 4m km of optical fibre a year, built by a joint venture including the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, a military-industrial group, and G42, an Abu Dhabi government-owned technology company. China’s Hengtong has established a similar plant in the Suez area, and is working on an expansion.
Weaknesses
Egypt lags behind many of its regional peers in terms of download speed, although it outperforms Algeria and Nigeria for mobile speed and is ahead of Turkey, Morocco, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Iran and Algeria for broadband speed.
What to watch - Telecom Egypt's 45% stake in Vodafone Egypt, the market leader for mobile services, could come up for sale again in the forecast period. Initial offers came in below Telecom Egypt’s target, and it was taken off the market in March 2024. The remaining 55% is owned by South Africa-based Vodacom, which acquired it from its UK-based parent, Vodafone, for US$3.1bn.
- The fintech segment will continue to expand rapidly. Egypt currently has more than 150 fintech start-ups, among which the major established players include Fawry, e-Finance AMAN and MNT-Halan. Investment funds in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi have acquired stakes in Fawry and e-Finance, and both companies are preparing to launch operations in Saudi Arabia.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: Egypt is surrounded by intensifying conflicts and is engaged in a dispute with Ethiopia over a dam. There is a high risk of spillover from the civil war in Sudan and from the widening conflict in the Middle East.
2027-29: Tensions with Ethiopia ratchet up but a deal is eventually agreed on Nile water management. Calming tensions in the Middle East reduce the risk of domestic social instability.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: Balance-of-payments risk is mitigated by strong inward foreign direct investment, multilateral funds (including an IMF loan) and to a lesser extent state asset sales. Inflation is high as a result of past currency devaluation and subsidy reform.
2027-29: The high-tide of reform pain on the economy passes and real GDP growth accelerates. The Central Bank of Egypt operates a relatively loose monetary policy under a flexible exchange rate and business confidence improves.
Market opportunities
2025-26: High inflation undermines real household spending, although this is partly offset by higher workforce participation. Increases to the minimum wage also protect a segment of the population from a steep decline in purchasing power.
2027-29: The macroeconomic backdrop stabilises and consumer confidence rises. By 2029 the population is 117m, from 107m in 2024.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The government continues with a selective divestment programme, mainly targeted at Gulf Arab investors. The military retains control of most of its core assets, presenting a barrier to the growth of private-sector investment.
2027-29: There are piecemeal efforts to ensure free and fair competition, but as balance-of-payment pressures abate, the emphasis on structural transformation fades.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: The government enhances incentives for foreign investors, through new tax breaks, wider access to fast-track "golden licences" and discounted land prices.
2027-29: Openness to foreign investment increases, underpinned by investment into renewable energy and real estate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: The import backlog stemming from restrictions imposed during 2022 is cleared, but the authorities only gradually pay off US dollar arrears to Egypt's international oil companies.
2027-29: Assuming the central bank keeps to a flexible exchange rate, EIU does not envisage the resumption of imbalances that could lead to foreign-exchange controls.
Taxes
2025-26: The government starts to apply new taxation rules for the public sector and the military, according to a law passed in mid-2023 to withdraw tax breaks for state enterprises. Military companies exploit loopholes in the law, however.
2027-29: The government continues to waver on implementing capital gains tax on stock market transactions, especially after Egypt's extended fund facility with the IMF reduces the incentive to raise revenue.
Financing
2025-26: Lending to the private sector is subdued, owing to rising interest rates early in the period.
2027-29: Domestic credit conditions improve as interest rates ease. Subsidies on lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and other designated groups are phased out.
The labour market
2025-26: Labour unrest grows as workers demand higher wages to compensate for rising inflation. Unemployment remains low, but this partly reflects the low participation rate, particularly among women. A new labour law comes into force.
2027-29: Labour participation gradually increases. Trade unions resist pension reforms that raise the retirement age to 65.
Infrastructure
2025-26: Major new rail projects, including a monorail serving the new administrative capital, progress. A second container terminal is built at East Port Said. Suez Canal development, new cities, slum clearance and infrastructure in Sinai are prioritised.
2027-29: Road and rail connections to 14 new satellite cities are completed. Investment in seawater desalination increases.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Tax payments are digitalised, and e-government is expanded.
2027-29: E-government portals are put into general use to automate the processes of business-licensing applications.
Business environment rankings Overview
Egypt's overall score improves for the forecast period (2025-29), and its regional and global rankings strengthen by one and three places respectively. The improvement in the rankings is attributable to a decline in balance-of-payment pressures in 2022-24 and a sharp deterioration in the outlook for countries that Egypt has overtaken, including Russia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. The enhanced scores for Egypt in the forecast period come in categories that will be affected by structural reforms designed to improve the performance of the economy and to upgrade the operating environment for the private sector.
Strengths
Market opportunities and foreign direct investment (FDI) will continue to be the most positive elements in Egypt's business outlook. A US$35bn investment by an Abu Dhabi sovereign fund in the Ras el-Hekma development on the Mediterranean in 2024 will act as a catalyst for similar schemes and for FDI generally, as businesses will be reassured by the improved availability of foreign exchange. The project over its lifespan could draw in a total of US$110bn by the 2040s, according to the developers. Other greenfield investment will be encouraged by a streamlining of regulations and outright deregulation. Much of the new investment will come from foreign companies (led by Gulf Arab investors) as well as European investment in renewable energy. A smaller privatisation process running in parallel will boost the capital market, as reflected in the improvement in the financing category of Egypt's rankings.
Weaknesses
Deep-seated weaknesses in Egypt's macroeconomic position and concerns about political stability in Egypt and in the wider region will dampen investor sentiment. Persistently high inflation in the first part of the forecast period means that poverty levels will remain high, deepening the disaffection with the authoritarian rule of the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, as reflected in the worsening in the political stability ranking. The lack of clarity about Mr Sisi’s intentions once his third and, supposedly, final term expires in 2029 will weigh on investor sentiment.
What to watch - A critical test of the government's commitment to structural reform will be whether the role of the military establishment in the economy is reduced. Thus far the military has resisted pressures to sell assets and to refrain from using its competitive advantage to dominate important sectors of the economy.
- Egypt is highly susceptible to a foreign payments crisis, stemming from a structurally low savings rate and a chronic external deficit, aggravated in the short to medium term by a growing dependence on imported energy. The clearance of arrears to the international operators of Egypt’s gasfields will reduce external buffers as this gradually happens. Inward investment will be a key component of capital finance, and inflows related to Ras el-Hekma will, in particular, be important for replenishing foreign reserves as they are periodically drawn down.

The political environment Overview
Egypt's political environment is ranked at 62nd out of 82 countries. The country is situated next to multiple conflict hotspots, which naturally raises the risk of Egypt becoming embroiled in external aggression. To the south there are signs that Egypt is becoming more assertive in the Sudanese civil war. To the west, it is indirectly involved in backing one of Libya's two rival power centres, and to the north-east the government is deeply concerned that the Israel-Hamas war will have consequential spillovers. A major force driving Egyptian foreign policy in the region is its international dispute with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Egypt believes will constrict water flow down the Nile. Egypt has threatened military strikes against the dam if it is filled (as it has been) without a water-sharing agreement it deems acceptable. The modus operandi is currently to isolate Ethiopia regionally and burnish Egypt's military capabilities by intervening in Somalia where in theory Egyptian troops could cut off access to a key Ethiopian port project. Domestically, the government is authoritarian, with virtually no mechanisms to hold the executive to account. This has led to arbitrariness in the legal and administrative spheres, which could extend to Egypt's foreign policy decisions too. Bureaucracy and corruption are prominent issues.
Strengths
Egypt under the president, Mr Sisi, has clamped down on terrorism and crime with a degree of success. Social and political instability rarely surfaces, but this is because of repression and low regard for human rights. There have been numerous attempts to streamline bureaucratic procedures, including a one-stop shop for licensing. The amended investment law of 2017 clarified the fiscal and legal terms for investors, and the policy direction is heavily weighted towards attracting overseas capital. So-called golden licences have significantly simplified the investment and project management process, granting a single authority oversight.
Weaknesses
The legal system is open to political interference and inconsistencies. A disregard for human rights, as well as instances of forced evictions (particularly in Sinai) and expropriation without compensation, underlines a lack of transparency and unevenness in the legal system.
What to watch- The GERD is being filled and each successive round of filling (during the summer months) raises tensions with Egypt. Both sides are steadfast in their positions; Egypt wants Ethiopia to adhere to water-sharing agreements introduced during the colonial era, whereas Ethiopia insists it has a sovereign right over its water resources. Intransigence could lead to war, although this is not EIU's central scenario. Ethiopia has enough backing within the region to make a military strike by Egypt a final resort and one with unpredictable consequences. We believe there is enough space to find common ground over water sharing and international monitoring to avert conflict.
- The regime is brittle. Regional instability is a potential springboard for social upheaval domestically, particularly given a backdrop of high inflation and declining living standards.


Market opportunities Overview
In population terms, Egypt boasts the largest consumer market in the Middle East and North Africa. The potential of this market will be constrained in the short to medium term by weak purchasing power per head in US dollar terms, given high inflation, devaluations of the Egyptian pound and low economic growth. Poorer consumers will remain wary of spending owing to subsidy reform and recent economic instability. GDP per head figures mask deep income disparities between the rich and the poor, with most of the population in the latter category. Over the medium to long term prospects for demand will strengthen as the labour market tightens and real wage growth picks up, but much of the population will remain in low-value work.
Strengths
We expect Egypt's population to grow at about the country's natural rate of 2% a year. By 2050 the population is projected at 150m people, or a third greater than estimated for 2024. Urbanisation will concentrate consumer demand in burgeoning cities, and spending power is expected to grow as Egypt's industrial and services sectors continue to develop. The extension of a minimum wage to the private sector in mid-2022 and subsequent upward adjustments have put a floor under real consumer demand, despite high inflation, and the policy has not led to a rise in formal unemployment (which by mid-2024 was at a record low).
Weaknesses
Low-income Egyptians comprise the majority of consumers, and this segment will continue to dominate the market profile. Although the middle class will expand alongside a growing economy in the medium to long term, Egypt is not in a position to move up global value chains in a way that would transform income per head. The low participation of women in the workforce (which typically only grows by 1.5% a year) also constrains household income and purchasing power.
What to watch- The participation rate of women in the workforce has increased significantly in 2021-24. This reflects income effects amid high inflation and a concomitant incentive to work to protect household spending power, as well as the introduction of a minimum wage for the private sector. As inflation normalises in the medium term, female participation may revert, dampening real consumption growth rates.
- Solid real wage growth into the future will depend on Egypt raising output per worker. A disproportionate number of Egyptians still work in agriculture where marginal productivity is diminishing. Urbanisation is likely to increase productivity, but many migrants leaving rural areas enter into low-skilled work in urban settings.

Taxes Overview
Egypt's global ranking worsens by three places owing to excessive fiscal deficits and the risk of tax rises, but its regional ranking is unchanged. According to a five-year tax strategy published in 2023, the 22.5% rate will stay in place. Corporate tax collection will improve following the digitalisation of the system. The government is seeking to boost tax revenue through newly introduced charges of 5-20% on various forms of entertainment and a 10% fee on luxury goods. A new top rate of personal income tax has been set at 27.5% for annual incomes of more than E£1.2m (US$25,000). The previous top rate was 25%. At the bottom of the scale, the tax threshold has been regularly increased during the recent inflationary surge, and it now stands at E£40,000 (US$820).
Strengths
Value-added tax (VAT) was introduced in 2016 and has become the bedrock of government tax revenue, accounting for about half of total tax receipts and almost a third of total fiscal revenue. VAT is currently charged at a standard rate of 14%. The government may eventually increase the rate, but this is unlikely to happen before the inflation rate comes down substantially. Assurance from the Ministry of Finance that no change is envisaged to the 22.5% corporation tax rate for five years confers the benefit of predictability, although many in the business community would like to see the rate lowered.
Weaknesses
The approach to capital gains tax (CGT) has been inconsistent. Implementation of the 2015 CGT law had been deferred repeatedly, given concerns about its impact on stockmarket investment. The tax was finally applied in January 2022. Residents are liable to CGT OF 10% on net portfolio earnings at the end of the tax year. Non-residents are exempt. The rate was lowered in March 2023, as part of a stimulus package, and in September 2024 the government indicated that it planned further changes. The main options under discussion are lowering the rate to about 2% or reverting to a stamp tax on share transactions. Complete abolition is unlikely as this would result in Egypt being classified as a tax haven under OECD rules. Resident and non-resident investors in non-listed companies are charged a withholding (or dividend) tax at a rate of 10%. The withholding tax rate for foreign investment in loans and other forms of debt securities is 20%.
What to watch - The government has declared its intention to abolish the extensive tax privileges enjoyed by state-owned companies, including military firms. Parliament has passed a law setting out these principles, while providing exemptions for activities related to national security, defence, basic infrastructure and projects covered by international agreements. The finance ministry has indicated that it expects this law to provide a major rise in tax revenue. However, much will depend on the details of its implementation. The military is likely to take effective steps to minimise its liabilities.
- In September 2024 the government announced plans for wide-ranging reform of the tax system, geared towards easing the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and generally simplifying the system for businesses. The proposed measures include setting up a central clearing system for tax payments; imposing a cap on penalties for late payment, so that the fines do not exceed the amount due; simplifying tax return forms; devising a simpler and more lenient tax structure for SMEs; and increasing the threshold for foreign companies to submit to transfer pricing examination.

The labour market Overview
Egypt’s score in this category rises, but its regional ranking remains the same, at eighth out of 17 countries. From a business perspective, the labour market offers an abundance of young workers, with graduates, post-graduates and skilled and semi-skilled workers available at competitive wages.
Strengths
The unemployment rate has fallen sharply in recent years, but there is still plenty of scope to raise the level of labour participation. The adverse effects of the pandemic led to a surge in the unemployment rate to almost 10% in 2020. Since then the rate has come down steadily, to 6.5% in mid-2024, with tourism, retail and construction accounting for much of the increase in employment. The agricultural sector, which employs about a fifth of the workforce, is crucial to maintaining employment levels. The labour participation rate is just 43.4%, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics. This is low by developing-market standards.
Weaknesses
With an estimated 30% of Egyptians living below the World Bank-defined poverty line, workers face strong pressures to emigrate. Egypt is a major source of irregular migration across the Mediterranean to Europe. Outward migration includes skilled workers and professionals from sectors including health and education. Remittances from the estimated 9m Egyptians working abroad provide an important stream of foreign exchange (nearly US$20bn in 2023) but are also a symptom of the poor state of the domestic economy.
What to watch - A new labour law came into effect at the start of 2024, following extensive debate in parliament since it was proposed by the government in early 2022. The law will make it easier for employers to dismiss workers, and sets stiffer conditions for strikes. According to the revised social insurance law, the normal retirement age will increase from 60 to 61 in 2032, and then rise in stages to 65 in 2040. Minimum pension contributions from both employers and employees are also set to increase in annual increments.
- The system for setting the minimum wage for the private sector is separate from the government-dictated rules for public-sector wages. In practice, the notionally independent National Council for Wages tends to fall more or less in line with decisions taken for the state payroll, although typically with a delay to allow for consultation with business. The minimum wage for both sectors has been increased regularly amid high inflation and cuts to energy subsidies. In May, following the flotation of the currency in March 2024, the minimum wage for the private sector was raised by 70% to E£6,000 per month. This brought it into line with an earlier increase in the public-sector minimum wage. Following fuel and electricity price rises in the third quarter of 2024, further increases in the minimum wage and in other benefits are likely.


Infrastructure Overview
Egypt's regional ranking for the quality and reliability of its infrastructure is unchanged for the 2025-29 forecast period, while its global ranking improves by just one place. This marks a regression from previous more positive trends because of the recent deterioration in electricity provision since mid-2023. New high-speed rail projects, including a freight-focused line from the Gulf of Suez to the Mediterranean, will start up in the next two to three years. Port capacity will increase with the completion of new projects at East Port Said, Sokhna, Damietta and Alexandria.
Strengths
Private-investor engagement in infrastructure projects has boosted growth in this sector. Most of the country's existing solar capacity, including a 1.65-GW, 41-lot solar park, has been developed by private firms. Private investors from Gulf states, Europe and Asia are involved in a series of major new wind and solar projects, some of which could be linked to green hydrogen facilities. Private investors are involved in all of the new maritime port expansions. Egypt's first dry port, at 6th of October City, is being developed as a public-private partnership (PPP). More dry ports are in the pipeline.
Weaknesses
Egypt has a comfortable surplus in installed power generation capacity, relative to the peak load, but most of this is fired by natural gas. Production of natural gas has faltered owing to depletion, technical hitches and a pause in investment by international operators because of a build-up of payment arrears. Since mid-2024 the government has sought to fill the supply gap by resuming imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and it is expecting increased pipeline supply from Israel from mid-2025. The payment arrears to upstream operators have been reduced, thanks to the foreign-exchange inflow from the Ras el-Hekma deal. However, there remains a risk of further shortfalls in natural gas supply in the forecast period. Meanwhile, renewables capacity will increase, and work is also progressing on a Russian-financed nuclear power station, which is likely to come on stream towards the end of the forecast period.
What to watch - Plans to sell energy assets to private investors have stalled owing to the crisis in the energy sector and the devaluation of the currency. The government will be looking to revive this programme following increases in domestic energy prices and the stabilisation of the exchange rate. Proposed sales include three 4.8-GW combined-cycle power stations built by Germany's Siemens. A tender for the first of these, at Beni Suef, has been cancelled. Multiple bidders for two wind farms, Gabal el-Zeit (580 MW) and Zaafarana (545 MW), are under evaluation.
- Major new urban developments, notably the new administrative capital and New Alamein, will put considerable strains on infrastructure, in particular water supply and wastewater. This comes amid uncertainty about the effects on Egypt's water supply of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which will restrict flows from the Blue Nile. The government has launched a programme to build 21 desalination plants, with a combined capacity of 8.85m cu metres/day. They will be undertaken on a PPP basis.

Foreign trade and exchange controls Overview
Egypt's rankings in this category improve marginally, owing to the recent lifting of import restrictions and the beneficial effects of the Ras el-Hekma deal on access to foreign exchange. The US$35bn from this deal, supplemented by other capital inflows, has enabled to government to clear a backlog of foreign-exchange orders of more than US$10bn because importers were unable to secure the foreign exchange to complete payment. Egypt will continue to face currency risk during the forecast period, despite the improvement in its external financial position in early 2024. This is because of the heavy debt-service burden and the large structural current-account deficit, as well as the possibility of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reversing course on a market-led exchange rate, as has happened multiple times before.

Strengths
Egypt has a relatively open trading system, and scores in the middle range for capital-account liberalisation, similar to Morocco, but just below Jordan. Customs clearance remains sluggish, but systems have improved with digitalisation and the rollout of an advanced cargo information system for both maritime ports and airports. The current account will benefit from growth in tourism revenue and a recovery in official flows of remittances following the early 2024 currency flotation and devaluation, and the overall balance of payments will be supported by strong capital inflows.
Weaknesses
The Egyptian economy remains vulnerable to external shocks. The conflict in Gaza and its wider regional reverberations have led to a sharp fall in traffic through the Suez Canal, with toll revenue down by 60% year on year in the first half of 2024. The current account has also been hit by a decline in natural gas production, which has pushed the petroleum sector balance of payments into heavy deficit. The widening current-account deficit has increased Egypt's reliance on capital inflows, including potentially volatile portfolio investment. As these flows reversed in 2022, a large backlog of foreign-exchange orders by importers emerged, much of which was later cleared as market conditions improved in 2023-24.
What to watch - The CBE’s commitment to a flexible exchange-rate policy will be tested during the forecast period. In the six months after the March 2024 flotation and 35% devaluation, the exchange rate stabilised, supported by a surge in foreign-exchange liquidity as a result of the Ras el-Hekma deal, but volatility has generally been lower than usual for a market-led exchange rate. We expect a general depreciatory trend over the medium to long term as a result of elevated inflation, assuming the central bank does allow the currency to follow market forces. The pound is projected to weaken from E£48:US$1 in September 2024 to an average of about E£59:US$1 in 2029. If the CBE once more resists market pressures, there is likely to be a revival of the black market.
- Hassan Abdalla has served as governor of the CBE on a temporary basis since the resignation of Tareq Amer in August 2022, less than two years into his second five-year term. Mr Abdalla’s mandate has been renewed twice for one year. A permanent replacement is likely to be appointed by November 2025, which would have marked the end of Mr Amer’s term. Mr Abdalla, an experienced and low-key banker, has established a good working relationship with the IMF, but ultimate authority on key monetary issues remains with the president.

Macroeconomic environment Overview
There will be underlying challenges to Egypt's macroeconomic environment in the forecast period, despite the relief that was brought in 2024 with the Ras el-Hekma deal and more than US$20bn of support pledged from other sources at that time, including the IMF. Economic stability is expected to improve overall in 2025-29, although Egypt will continue to rank bottom of the 17 countries covered in the Middle East and Africa region, reflecting its elevated debt levels (domestic and external), persistently high inflation and a large structural current-account deficit. There is a risk that the extended fund facility (EFF) programme with the IMF could stall once more if the government continues to prevaricate over implementing promised structural reforms.
Strengths
A few sectors of the economy have the potential to grow rapidly, creating jobs and boosting foreign-exchange earnings. The recovery of tourism following the coronavirus pandemic gained momentum in 2023-24, breaking records for both visitor numbers and revenue. By 2029 tourism has the potential to bring in more than US$20bn a year, although the sector will remain vulnerable to security crises in Egypt or in the surrounding region. Devaluation of the Egyptian pound has brought down asset prices to a more attractive level for foreign investors, while conferring a strong competitive advantage on Egyptian exporters. Foreign investors are showing growing interest in renewables, gold mining and real estate. Chinese and Turkish businesses will strengthen their presence in export-oriented manufacturing.
Weaknesses
Egypt’s financial position will remain highly vulnerable to external shocks, originating in import prices or regional tensions (or both combined). Suez Canal revenue, one of Egypt’s main sources of foreign currency, fell by more than 60% in 2024 as international shipping was deterred from using the Red Sea route because of attacks on shipping by Yemen's Houthi forces in support of Gaza. Egypt’s energy sector has also been badly affected by the foreign-exchange crisis that stemmed from the outflow of portfolio investment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—foreign companies reined in upstream investment because of a build-up of payment arrears and the outstanding balance will be burdensome to pay down (we expect this to happen only gradually). Egypt’s external financial position is likely to strengthen in the second half of the forecast period, assuming regional tensions eventually subside. In the meantime, the risk of macroeconomic instability will be ever present, especially given the unpredictable regional security backdrop.
What to watch- Relations with the IMF will have a major bearing on macroeconomic policy and performance. The EFF that was signed in December 2022 is meant to last until October 2026. The agreement was suspended after just three months as the government reverted to a fixed exchange-rate system but was later revived in March 2024, and boosted by US$5bn to US$8bn, after the flotation of the currency. However, further tensions are possible as the government faces political obstacles to enacting structural reforms that would require a significant reduction in the economic power of the military establishment. Key to watch in this regard is Egypt’s commitment in other politically delicate areas of the EFF such as subsidy cuts, particularly for fuel. Our baseline forecast is that enough will be done to keep the EFF moving, but the backdrop is highly challenging for the regime, given high inflation and regional geopolitical developments, which could be a catalyst for wider social instability.
- We expect the annual inflation rate to remain above 20% until the second half of 2025. This will bear down on private consumption, keeping the real GDP growth rate at 3-4% in the first part of the forecast period. Interest rates will also remain elevated, which will be a drag on domestic investment. We expect inflation to ease below 10% on average in the second half of the forecast period, but the Central Bank of Egypt is likely to maintain positive real interest rates to attract continued portfolio investment in government securities issued to finance public debt. The government will meet its target of bringing down public debt from more than 90% of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2023/24 (July-June) to under 80%, but not within the EFF's lifespan. We expect the target to be achieved by mid-2028.


Policy towards foreign investment Overview
Egypt's score for policy towards foreign investment improves markedly for the forecast period, and its global and regional rankings rise by nine and five places respectively, to 56th and sixth. This reflects the priority that the government has given to FDI as an essential ingredient in generating growth and in filling its large financing gap. The US$35bn deal with ADQ, an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, for the development of the Ras el-Hekma region on the Mediterranean, has distorted the FDI inflow figure for 2024 (which is likely to reach about US$45bn), but it has created a precedent for similar deals that are now under consideration, such as that to develop the Ras Banas peninsula on the Red Sea, east of Aswan. In 2022 sales of shares held by state entities in five listed companies raised more than US$3bn, helping to boost FDI to US$11.4bn, the highest level in 15 years. ADQ and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund have been the leading institutional investors. The government is also seeking to attract more greenfield investment by broadening the criteria for fast-track "golden licences" (which were originally restricted to strategic projects), improving the terms for operating in special economic zones and offering preferential credit terms to finance land acquisitions. Chinese investment in Egypt, including in a section of the Suez Canal Economic Zone, has been rising steadily, reaching more than US$800m in 2024, centred on manufacturing and heavy industry (chemicals and metals).
Strengths
Egypt offers foreign investors a wide range of opportunities and attractions. These include a domestic market of over 100m people and a large, predominantly young, labour force, including skilled technicians and professionals, many of whom have had experience of working in the Gulf, Europe or North America. Egypt has considerable untapped natural resources, notably minerals, a sector that is starting to attract more interest following amendments to the mining code. This was recently illustrated with the US$2.5bn acquisition of Centamin, Egypt’s largest gold producer, by New York-listed AngloGold Ashanti. Egypt's geographic location is an added advantage; the Suez Canal offers opportunities for logistical and industrial development targeted at export markets in Europe, Africa and Asia. Abundant sunshine, plentiful open land and established wind corridors make Egypt a good location for solar and wind power, potentially linked to green hydrogen.
Weaknesses
Despite repeated government assurances of speedy approvals and timely processing of tax affairs, investors face bureaucratic obstacles, alongside delays in clearing materials and equipment through customs, and in securing foreign exchange to finance imports and to repatriate dividends. Investors also have to take into account the obstructive and monopolistic behaviour of the military establishment.
What to watch - The new cabinet that was formed in July 2024 included the revival of the Ministry of Investment, after a five-year break during which the role of overseeing foreign investment was undertaken by the prime minister’s office. This could provide quicker access to decision-makers for foreign investors and an opportunity to address issues related to the implementation of Investment Law No. 72, which was passed in 2017.
- The government has announced a series of framework agreements for new investment zones. They include an industrial development zone linked to the East Port Said container transshipment terminal, an expansion of the Chinese industrial development zone by the Suez Canal, and the Golden Triangle zone, which is dedicated to phosphate processing and linked to Safaga, a Red Sea port. Progress with these projects could hinge on how soon global shipping returns to the Red Sea, having been deterred since late 2023 by attacks by Yemen’s Houthi forces.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
Egypt's policy towards private enterprise and competition will improve over 2025-29 as the government seeks to streamline the regulatory system and promote private investment. The global and regional rankings both improve as a result. In 2023 the government launched a strategy aimed at increasing the private sector's share of total investment from 30% to 65% within three years. Targets included raising US$40bn over four years through the sale of state holdings in companies and infrastructure, a highly ambitious target that in our view will not be met (and will be deprioritised by the Ras el-Hekma deal). To complement divestments, the government has also passed a law designed to create a level playing field for the private sector by abolishing tax exemptions for state companies, including those controlled by the military, and defining sectors from which state investment is excluded. A new cabinet that was appointed in July 2024 included the reinstatement of the post of investment minister, after a five-year break, in a signal of commitment. The minister is Hassan el-Khatib, an investment banker. However, the new law rationalising the regulatory field has loopholes (for example, national security enterprises are exempt) that will make it hard to enforce against determined and entrenched state interests.
Strengths
Egypt has an established judicial framework for commercial competition, and this was strengthened with the 2023 approval of amendments to the 2005 competition law. The main change is the requirement for companies planning mergers to secure clearance from the Egyptian Competition Authority before the transaction is concluded. The original law only obliged the transaction party to notify the regulatory authority within one month after closure. Fines for non-compliance have also been stiffened, to 10% of turnover, from 1%. More broadly, Egypt has a large and diversified private sector, buttressed by a well-developed commercial and investment banking system and by a vigorous capital market.
Weaknesses
Private businesses operate at a disadvantage in many sectors, given the presence of state entities, including those controlled by the military establishment, that benefit from a wide range of exemptions from fees and taxes, and that have privileged access to critical resources such as land, finance, utilities and labour. A public divestment programme has been back-loaded in the EFF and slippages on asset sales are likely as Ras el-Hekma has eased financing bottlenecks. The government regularly professes its commitment to increased private-sector investment in an environment of free and fair competition. However, state interests are strongly represented at all levels of the political and administrative system, and the judiciary is heavily politicised. The grip of the military and the state intelligence services over the business sector has strengthened in the decade since Mr Sisi seized power.
What to watch- The government has instructed state-owned enterprises, including military firms, to provide regular quarterly financial statements. However, the schedule for this remains vague, and there is as yet no clear enforcement mechanism.
- The Sovereign Fund of Egypt (SFE) will take a new direction following the resignation of its chief executive, Ayman Soliman, who had been in charge since the sovereign wealth fund’s launch in 2018. The SFE sought to play the role of incubator for the privatisation of state assets. This entailed transferring a portion of the equity to the SFE, which would then seek private-sector partners through public listings and asset sales. It was also involved in setting up new ventures with private-sector partners. The SFE has struggled to make progress with its asset sales, however. Its flagship project for the sale of power stations has been abandoned, and efforts to sell stakes in military-controlled companies have made little headway. Noha Khalil, one of Mr Soliman’s deputies, has taken charge of the SFE pending the appointment of a new chief executive.

Financing Overview
Egypt's score improves sharply, pushing the country's rankings from 69th to 51st globally and from 12th to seventh in the Middle East and Africa region. This is based on the lasting impact of almost US$60bn in external financing secured in early 2024, including the US$35bn Ras el-Hekma deal (much of which was paid upfront) and an increase in the IMF extended fund facility to US$8bn. The EU and the World Bank also approved finance packages of US$8bn and US$6bn, respectively. We expect sovereign wealth funds from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to continue to pump capital into Egypt via acquisitions of both listed and unlisted assets and through investment in greenfield projects. Bank lending to the private sector will grow at a modest rate, because of the government's chronic need for deficit financing and because of the deterrent effect of high interest rates on corporate borrowers. About two-thirds of domestic credit is made up of lending to the government, mainly in the form of treasury bills and bonds, with the private business sector accounting for only about 21%. These ratios are unlikely to change substantially during the forecast period.

Strengths
Egypt has access to finance from a wide range of international and regional institutions. The World Bank remains heavily engaged in Egypt, with a large pipeline of development loans, including major projects supporting the health and education sectors and social safety net programmes. The European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan, Germany, France and South Korea will continue to provide credit for infrastructure projects. Egypt will also make extensive use of credit lines from the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and Arab development agencies. It is a member of the National Development Bank, an institution established by the BRICS group, a bloc that originally comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China and that Egypt joined in early 2024.
Weaknesses
Egypt has rapidly accumulated external debt, which increased fourfold over a decade, reaching just over US$167bn by end-2023. The debt stock fell to US$160bn at end-March 2024, mainly thanks to the Ras el-Hekma deal, which included the conversion of just over US$5bn in Central Bank of the UAE deposits to equity in that project. A large portion of this debt must be repaid or refinanced over the next five years. This includes about US$14bn to the IMF, with a bunching of US$8bn in interest and principal payments due in 2025-26. Egypt also needs to pay about US$1.5bn a year in interest on its stock of US$25bn in sovereign Eurobonds, with a further US$6.6bn in principal payments during 2025-29.
What to watch - The government has diversified sources of external finance as a result of US dollar strength in 2022-24, with some success. Recently tapped debt markets will give Egypt more options for issuance in future even as the Eurobond market gradually becomes available again, in line with interest-rate cuts in advanced economies. More borrowing from China, which currently accounts for only about US$8.8bn of Egypt's total external debt, according to the CBE, is possible. Existing debt to China includes a US$2.6bn currency swap, and about US$500m in Panda bonds, although these involved a guarantee from multilateral banks. The government has also issued Japanese Samurai bonds and a series of green bonds. Egypt will also issue more sovereign sukuk (Islamic securities) following a successful US$1.5bn debut in February 2023.
- Gulf Arab investors will seek to expand their presence in Egypt's investment banking sector. This follows the recent acquisition by Chimera, an Abu Dhabi-based finance company, of a 55.9% stake in Beltone, one of Egypt's leading investment banks. Chimera has also acquired a minority stake in the market leader, EFG Hermes. However, an earlier bid by First Abu Dhabi Bank to acquire a controlling stake in EFG Hermes was withdrawn in April 2022.

Abstract: Foreign investors have access to local capital markets and companies generally enjoy good access to medium-term finance. The risk of a banking sector crisis that might prevent access to credit or liquidity is low, although the local sector net external liability position indicates its reliance on smooth global funding. The RBA also stands to benefit from the appointment of a specific monetary policy board of experts to work alongside the existing board, who will focus on governance. According to the Speedtest Global Index, Australia ranked 25th out of 143 countries for its mobile internet speed in April 2024.

Full text: Overview
Australia's overall score falls slightly to 7.96 in 2025-29, from 8.04 in 2020-24, causing its global rank to slip by one place to 14th (although its regional rank, at 4th, remains unchanged). The mild deterioration primarily reflects our assessment that the government will struggle to address the high degree of market concentration across a number of sectors in Australia—including airlines, banking, electricity, supermarkets and telecommunications—which has fostered concerns of uncompetitive behaviour in recent years. Nevertheless, Australia remains among the Asia-Pacific region's most attractive places to do business. The country enjoys a stable and effective political environment as well as a relatively rosy economic outlook and is open to foreign trade. Authorities are welcoming of most foreign investment, with the exception of some capital from China, particularly that destined for projects in areas of strategic significance. The structural deceleration in Chinese growth over 2025-29 presents some risk factors for Australia's export outlook, particularly mineral commodities from Western Australia.
Strengths
Australia's political environment is one of the strongest in the world. There is deep respect for democracy, with compulsory voting and a three-year voting cycle keeping the electorate engaged. There is also a genuine choice to voters, with marked policy differentiation between the Greens on the left and the National Party on the right. However, political stability is expected to slip in the coming years, with the rise of "teal" independents complicating efforts by either of the two main political parties to form lower-house majorities.
Weaknesses
The labour market is Australia's weakest category and is expected to deteriorate further in 2025-29. Although wages are extremely high for the region, they are growing only modestly ahead of consumer price inflation. The Labor Party will continue to prioritise the enhancement of workers' rights, even as cost-of-living concerns continue to spur strikes and lockouts in the near term. The government will sharply reduce the number of international students in the forecast period, while also tightening its visa regulations for overseas short-term (both skilled and unskilled) labour, given allegations that a boom in inbound arrivals is fuelling the country's housing crisis. This will eventually reduce some supply streams for skilled labour from the mid-2020s. Nevertheless, the government will generally remain welcoming of professional talent, even as it adopts stricter immigration criteria.
What to watch- Housing unaffordability, against the backdrop of a wider cost-of-living crisis, will continue to capture the attention of most Australians (and Australian policymakers) in the run-up to the next federal elections. Those contests, which will decide the composition of the House of Representatives (lower house of parliament) and about half of the Senate (upper house), must be held by late September 2025. In the interim, Labor will push for more proactive policies aimed at recuperating its support among Australian voters, who have grown frustrated with the party's stewardship of the economy since it came into government in May 2022.

Financing Overview
Australia has a sophisticated financial system in which foreign and domestic firms compete on equal terms. Foreign investors have access to local capital markets and companies generally enjoy good access to medium-term finance. Australia's score for financing remains at 8.5 in 2024-28, triggering a fall from second to tenth place globally (reflecting stronger improvements elsewhere). The risk of a banking sector crisis that might prevent access to credit or liquidity is low, although the local sector net external liability position indicates its reliance on smooth global funding. Profitability in the sector is likely to fall in 2025, as we expect an eventual (but gradual) decline in interest rates back to neutral levels starting from late 2024. The country's commercial banks will pass the vast majority of these cuts on to their clients.
Strengths
The central bank is undergoing major changes as a result of a Labor government inquiry, which we believe will improve its performance. The RBA's independence is respected, but the government wants to ensure it by removing a clause that allows parliament to over-rule RBA decisions. The RBA also stands to benefit from the appointment of a specific monetary policy board of experts to work alongside the existing board, who will focus on governance. These changes are subject to legislative approval in the coming year.
Weaknesses
Australia's banking sector is open and competitive, but will remain concentrated by international standards. The sector is dominated by four major banks: Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ), National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac, together which held 72% of the sector's assets in 2023. It was notable that a tribunal overturned the ACCC's previous block on the acquisition of Suncorp, a smaller lender, by ANZ in early 2024, by putting the burden of proof on the ACCC to prove that the purchase would be anti-competitive. This suggests that the sector is only likely to become more concentrated in the coming years, but a merger between any of the big four is highly unlikely.
What to watch- Banks' credit impairment costs are worth watching as a proxy for the impact of households' mortgage stress on the banking sector. NAB, for example, announced a rise of 17% quarter on quarter for October-December in its impairment bill, to A$190m. Delinquency rates remain contained, at under 2%, for now, but these are likely to rise for as long as the RBA keeps interest rates at above-neutral levels.

Technological readiness Overview
Australia's score for technological readiness remains at 8.6. Improvements elsewhere have resulted in Australia's global ranking dropping from 14th to 18th. In effect, the entire population uses the internet, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), and almost everyone uses social media or other communication apps. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital communications, according to ACMA, with only 18% of Australians making a landline phone call at home in the first half of 2023. More than four-fifths of those aged over 75 used a mobile phone to access the internet in the survey period, compared with just one-third in 2017. With the country's elderly increasingly online, all age groups in Australia can be said to be digitally proficient.
Strengths
The country's online architecture is reliable and relatively fast. According to the Speedtest Global Index, Australia ranked 25th out of 143 countries for its mobile internet speed in April 2024. (Its fixed speed was markedly less impressive, at 94th out of 181 countries.) Currently, 5G services are available to most major urban centres and rural access will improve rapidly in the forecast period.
Weaknesses
The government recognises that cybercrime is a growing threat and will continue to invest in cyber-security in 2024-28. Nevertheless, its efforts have been unable to stop major companies falling victim to hacks. Optus, Medibank, Nissan and DP World are among the high-profile firms to have had their systems breached in the past 18 months. In the Optus hack, personal details of 10m Australians were stolen, while the DP World attack halted work at several of the countries' busiest ports.
What to watch- The tense diplomatic relationship between Australia and China often spills into the digital sphere, including periodic reporting of Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage against Australian officials. The latest allegations, issued in May 2024, concerned Chinese hacking attempts against six Australian members of parliament; similar cyber-attacks were recorded in September 2019. Incidents of electoral interference—as well as claims of foreign manipulation, whether real or unsubstantiated—are likely to occur ahead of future political events, and may include attempted thefts of voter data or the publication of disinformation campaigns. This could include tactics common to China's cyber-harassment of other economies, such as Taiwan, involving bots or fake social-media accounts; all of these incidents will test the resilience of Australia's digital architecture.

Policy towards foreign investment Overview
Australia remains generally welcoming towards foreign investment, but there are more areas in which the government is very sensitive—a trend we expect to continue in 2024-28. This explains the decline in its index score in the forecast period. Large foreign investments are subject to a screening process by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), although most proposals reviewed by the agency receive approval. The general threshold for the screening of private-sector foreign investment by the FIRB is revised annually and stands at A$330m (US$219m) for 2024. The thresholds are much tighter for agriculture, energy, media and other sensitive sectors, but looser for investors from countries with which Australia has free-trade agreements (FTAs).
Strengths
Formal mechanisms to identify and provide incentives for major investment projects will remain in place. To qualify, projects must have the potential to bring substantial economic and employment benefits. The Major Project Facilitation Agency, administered by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, is open to investments of more than A$20m in all sectors, although projects are mainly resource-related. (There is additional help for projects worth over A$50m.) State governments may also offer incentives, such as holidays from payroll tax.
Weaknesses
The screening process for potential acquisitions of Australian asses by Chinese firms will be particularly thorough. Proposals to acquire energy transmission and distribution assets, and other assets deemed to be critical infrastructure, will come under even closer scrutiny. In 2023 the government blocked the takeover of a struggling Australian lithium miner, Alita Resources, by a local company, Austroid, because its director was a Chinese national with experience of the Chinese mining industry. The Chinese government regularly complains that Australia discriminates against Chinese firms in making investment decisions.
What to watch- Foreign owners of Australian properties should expect to face penalties in the coming years if they are found to be leaving houses and apartments vacant. The government is keen to boost housing stock amid the national housing shortage, even as they resist more politically contentious reforms (such as ending negative gearing or advocating for high density housing). Application processing fees for would-be foreign owners are also likely to rise steeply.

Macroeconomic environment Overview
Australia's score in the macroeconomic environment category improves in EIU's forecast period and its position in the global and regional rankings rises. Economic growth will remain tepid while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA, the central bank) holds interest rates at above-neutral levels in order to bring down consumer price inflation. From 2025, however, the economy will benefit from income tax cuts, public investment in green technologies and continued (if somewhat reduced) external demand for the country's commodity wealth. The economy is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with more frequent and more severe episodes of extreme weather occurring in recent years.
Strengths
The economy will perform better in 2024-28 than in 2019-23, when it was assailed by the many and complex effects of the covid-19 pandemic. Absent another major supply shock, consumer price inflation should be easier for policymakers to manage, which would also result in lower interest rates and less onerous debt-repayment conditions for stretched households. The economy has begun the process of diversifying from China, a trend that will continue in the next five years and will add to its resilience to future shocks.
Weaknesses
The housing sector continues to present a major risk to overall economic performance. The country's long-standing shortfall has pushed up prices to very high levels. Prices fell when the RBA began to tighten interest rates, but began to climb again once buyers were satisfied that rates had reached the peak in the current cycle. High levels of net inward migration have also pushed up demand. There are multiple consequences for the economy. Private rents have held up the process of slowing inflation and reducing interest rates, while more of household income is being spent on mortgage payments. The biggest risk remains mortgage defaults rising to the point where prices drop in a disorderly manner. Buyers of expensive properties with small deposits during the pandemic are particularly vulnerable to entering negative equity and losing the ability to afford their repayments. The risk of this outcome is small, but the potential impact on the broader economy is fairly large.
What to watch- Chinese demand for Australian commodities in 2024-28 will weaken against the historical period, given the ongoing crisis in China's property sector (a major consumer of Australian iron ore and other minerals). The speed at which export sales slow will be an influential factor on the overall pace of GDP growth, such has been the scale of exports to China in the past 20 years.

Infrastructure Overview
Australia has extensive and well-developed infrastructure in roads, railways, airports, telecommunications, energy distribution and water supply. However, the geographical extent of the country relative to the small population will stretch limited resources, which means that the country ranks only 32nd globally in this category. Continued investment in port and rail networks will be needed for Australia to take full advantage of demand for agricultural and mineral-resource commodities created by ongoing develop-ment in Asia. Much of this is undertaken by the corporate sector; the major mining companies typically invest in the entire supply chain, from mine to port. State and federal government spending on transport—particularly in the major cities—and other infrastructure is likely to increase in 2024-28, with the government supporting green energy transition efforts in particular (such as through an upgrade to the electricity network and rollout of electric vehicles).
Strengths
The federal government is getting to grips with problems in the planning and allocation of resources for infrastructure projects. Infrastructure Australia is charged with specifying national and state-level priorities, but that organisation has been subject to political pressure in recent years. Federal and state governments have been guilty of trying to sideline it in order to promote projects viewed as politically advantageous. A government-commissioned independent review in late 2023 recommended axing 50 projects worth A$11.6bn because of their dubious economic merit. A continuation of this more thorough process to assess infrastructure projects is likely to result in more efficient use of public spending.
Weaknesses
Australia has a poor track record of delivering public infrastructure projects on time and within budget. During her 2023 review of the country's pipeline, the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, noted that budget plans had been hit by the increase of construction materials (partly because of the damage to supply chains during the covid-19 pandemic), the impact of a tight labour market on the cost of labour, and competition between the public and private sectors (notably big mining companies) for materials and workers. We believe that the government will be more realistic in the number of projects it will approve in 2024-28, but also that the number of major projects completed will be relatively small.
What to watch- The fate of NBN, the state-owned entity that operates much of the country's broadband network, is likely to be debated again in the next five years. Officials originally intended for NBN to eventually be privatised once the roll-out of the network was complete and the company had millions of paying subscribers. Costs have been higher than expected at every stage, however, and the company remains heavily indebted. If the government is able to stabilise NBN financial performance in 2024-28, such as through the launch of faster services, privatisation may again become a consideration.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition Overview
Australia's score for policy towards private enterprise improves in 2024-28, pushing the country from fifth to third place in our global rankings. The Labor government has prioritised reducing anti-competitive practices. A Senate inquiry into pricing by the country's two largest supermarket chains is ongoing. The government will not break up the firms, but it will consider steps to make market entry easier (although we expect this to be difficult in practice). Another area of focus will be greenwashing by companies across the economy. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be handed a remit to investigate environmental claims as the country transitions towards a lower-carbon future.
Strengths
Interactions between the public and private sectors will be monitored more closely in 2024-28 following the creation of a National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) in 2022. Although primarily focused on the activities of public servants, the NACC has the power to examine the behaviour of lobbyists and anyone who could "adversely affect" the decisions of public officials.
Weaknesses
The period of high consumer price inflation in 2022-24 has highlighted the lack of competition in the economy. An inquiry by the bipartisan economics committee of the House of Representatives (the lower house) argued in early 2024 that living standards were under threat from low competition. It believes that an increase in market concentration has resulted in higher prices and lower choices for consumers. Among its recommendations, we expect the government to legislate that all mergers above a yet-to-be-defined level must be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for approval. At present, the ACCC examines only about 20% of the total.
What to watch- Electricity prices will be an area of focus for the government and of contention for consumers in the coming years. An ACCC enquiry in late 2023 found that almost 80% of consumers were paying equal to or more than the median offer on plan-comparison websites, suggesting that millions of Australians could save money by switching their electricity supplier. The report was also critical of electricity retailers making it unnecessarily difficult for customers to switch suppliers.

The labour market Overview
Australia's labour market score is its weakest in the categories and slips from 6.9 in 2019-23 to 6.6 in 2024-28, pulling down its global ranking from 19th to 32nd place. Australia has a deep pool of highly educated and skilled workers, but wages are very high, the union movement is strong and hiring additional foreign employees is difficult. The main piece of industrial relations legislation, the Fair Work Act, is accompanied by National Employment Standards—a set of ten minimum, non-negotiable employment conditions. Australia also has a system of more than 100 awards; these are legally binding rulings that set minimum wage and employment conditions for workers in a given industry or occupation. Two government bodies, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) and the Fair Work Ombudsman, have a regulatory role in setting minimum wages and enforcing compliance with the Fair Work Act.
Strengths
Although workers are unhappy about the rising cost of living and firms are dissatisfied with the difficulty of hiring workers, the Australian labour market is fundamentally enjoying a successful period. Unemployment has been below its long-run average for several years. We do not expect unemployment to rise above levels previous considered normal while interest rates remain elevated, owing largely to the fact that underlying demand remains relatively healthy, despite the squeeze on household and business costs.
Weaknesses
Political considerations are interfering with businesses desires to increase the supply of labour. The government has cut its visa issuance for foreign students in the coming years dramatically, which will impede the supply of skilled labour long after the current period of high inflation ends.
What to watch- The government will continue to look to improve working conditions in the remainder of its term and will maintain this goal if it is re-elected in 2025. A slew of industrial relations provisions were passed in late 2023 and more are imminent, including protections under the FWC for workers in the gig economy.

Taxes Overview
Australia's score for taxes rises to 8 in 2024-28, and its global ranking climbs four places to 17th. The top personal income tax rate is high, at 45% for incomes of more than A$180,000, with marginal tax rates of 32.5% on incomes of more than A$45,000 and 37% on those above A$120,000 for fiscal year 2023/24 (July-June). There is also a 2% levy to fund the universal healthcare scheme, Medicare. The standard corporate tax rate of 30% is among the highest in the OECD. Small and medium-sized businesses are taxed at 25%.
Strengths
Labor has announced major changes to the stage 3 tax cuts that were legislated by the Liberal-National coalition government in 2019. From July (marking the beginning of the 2024/25 fiscal year), the threshold for the 37% rate will be raised to A$135,000 and for the 45% rate to A$190,000. The rate of the bottom bracket will be cut from 19% to 16%. The government believes that these changes will cost the same as the coalition's plans, which would have seen the bulk of the benefit directed at very high earners, but will result in more Australians receiving a tax cut.
Weaknesses
Amid a housing crisis that is causing the government to implement policies that are likely to compromise long-term economic growth (such as cutting the number of visa for foreign students), the tax system still permits generous deductions for landlords. Both Labor and the Liberal-National coalition remain in favour of negative gearing, which allows landlords to deduct any losses they make on their investment properties (for example, if repairs and maintenance are larger than the rent they receive from tenants) from their income tax bill. The benefits of negative gearing are tilted towards older and wealthier Australians, however, meaning that the measure stands in opposition to the federal government's focus on reducing generational inequality. This will preserve housing unaffordability as an issue, particularly for younger Australians.
What to watch- There will be periodic debate about the need for a higher rate of goods and services tax (GST). Future changes could include an increase in the tax rate, currently at 10%, or a broadening of the tax base. For any change to occur, it must have the support of all state governments and the federal authorities and is therefore subject to a high threshold. A higher rate of GST is more likely to occur under a federal Labor administration than one run by the Liberal-National coalition.

Business environment at a glance The political environment
2025-26: The next Australian federal elections must be held by September 2025. There is a growing risk that the ruling Labor Party will be forced into a minority government.
2027-29: Australian voters grow increasingly disenchanted with the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition. This will drive support towards third parties, including the Greens and "teal" independents.
Macroeconomic environment
2025-26: Economic growth rebounds slightly as interest rates begin to drift downwards from early 2025, allowing domestic demand to recover. Housing construction nevertheless remains constrained by strict zoning laws, resistance to high density housing, labour shortages and high financing costs, preserving cost-of-living concerns for many Australians.
2027-29: A bottoming out in China's property sector revives demand for Australian mineral commodities. Nevertheless, the overall deceleration in the Chinese economy, as well as the end of that country's housing boom, keeps Australian export growth slower than the rates enjoyed in the 2010s.
Market opportunities
2025-26: Private consumption remains steady as cost-of-living pressures recede, but remains concentrated in the services sector. The number of short-term visitors finally returns to pre-pandemic levels, although tourist volumes continue to outstrip expenditure, as Chinese travellers spend less.
2027-29: Real wage growth remains stable, but grows at a pace slightly below pre-pandemic trends. Median household incomes continue to climb, and the gradual greying of the population and continued immigration spur demand for healthcare spending.
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2025-26: The government continues to focus on the lack of competition in the grocery sector. New codes of conduct, alongside fines for anti-competitive behaviour, do not significantly weaken the dominance of the two major supermarket groups.
2027-29: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission takes a greater interest in companies' environmental credentials, risking more punitive actions for false claims. Large private-sector incumbents continue to dominate sectors like airlines, banking, electricity and telecommunications.
Policy towards foreign investment
2025-26: The government remains welcoming to most foreign investment. However, asset acquisitions by foreign state-owned investors—notably those from China—face tough scrutiny. Penalties are floated for foreign owners of Australian properties who are found to be leaving houses and apartments vacant.
2027-29: Restrictions are maintained on foreign investment in "sensitive" sectors such as banking, agriculture and the media.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2025-26: The government encourages businesses to deepen commercial ties with India and South-east Asia, as part of efforts to diversify trade from China. However, progress is constrained by China's lifting of punitive import measures imposed in 2020-22, and the enduring attractiveness of its market.
2027-29: Free-trade negotiations with the EU, which will have resumed by 2026, are ultimately concluded. Downside risks to these assumptions include disagreements in agricultural market access and environmental compliance topics.
Taxes
2025-26: The government remains reluctant to address or dismantle "negative gearing," which allows landlords to deduct losses on their investment properties from their income tax bill. The controversial measure is widely seen as fuelling the country's housing crisis.
2027-29: Higher taxes come into effect, again, on large superannuation (pension) holdings, and some tax breaks for landlords are pared back. Debate intensifies over the need for a higher rate for the goods and services tax.
Financing
2025-26: Financing costs continue to trend downwards, as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) begins to lower its policy rate from early 2025 as inflation slows. Reforms to the RBA, including as regards its interest-rate setting mechanisms, continue, but are watered down by political concerns.
2027-29: Firms generally enjoy good access to medium-term finance. Interest-rate cuts end in 2027, but remain at levels well above those in the 2010s.
The labour market
2025-26: The unemployment rate ticks up slightly, but remains well below its pre-pandemic average. Real wage growth remains positive, although only slightly above headline inflation. Immigration criteria are tightened in response to allegations that foreign arrivals are fuelling the country's housing crisis. Efforts to expand arrivals by overseas construction workers, which should help to address the housing shortage, face resistance by domestic trade unions.
2027-29: Australia remains an attractive destination for skilled migration. However, tighter restrictions on foreign students and overseas workers exacerbate some talent shortages in the economy, maintaining some upward pressure on wages in certain industries.
Infrastructure
2025-26: Revisions to the federal infrastructure pipeline mean that fewer projects proceed, but transport networks and green energy projects remain areas of focus.
2027-29: Work continues on a range of infrastructure projects, focusing particularly on roads, railways (including the Sydney Metro) and airports, as well as the expansion of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme.
Technological readiness
2025-26: Mobile broadband speeds improve dramatically with the rollout of 5G networks. The government increases its budget outlay for cyber-security and resilience.
2027-29: Privatisation of the National Broadband Network returns to the political agenda. The government makes progress on its Digital Transformation Strategy and deployment of the internet of things.

Foreign trade and exchange controls Overview
Australia's continued commitment to and pursuit of free trade will raise its score for foreign trade and exchange controls in the coming years, pushing up its global rank from 25th to 11th in 2024-28. Most imports under Australia's growing number of FTAs and from developing countries enter the country tariff-free. The trade regime is liberal and there are no import quotas. The protectionist sentiment that has arisen in other developed countries has not taken root in Australia, which has benefited economically from open trade relationships. Consequently, we expect successive governments to continue to pursue a combination of bilateral and multilateral negotiations to promote Australia's commercial interests. There are no restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange and no exchange controls. A reporting system for cash payments records all transactions of A$10,000 (US$6,700) or more for tax-matching purposes.
Strengths
The Labor government has been successful in restoring the Australia-China bilateral trade relationship after China imposed punitive tariffs on a range of Australian goods in 2021. Tariffs on wine imports were lifted in early 2024, with remaining duties on Australian beef and crustaceans likely to be rescinded by mid-year. Although we expect Chinese demand for Australian commodities to weaken in the forecast period, China remains the country's largest trading partner and a stable economic relationship is crucial for the overall health of the economy.
Weaknesses
The Australian government ended negotiations on an FTA with the EU, which had been years in the making, in late 2023. We expect that European interest in securing better access to Australian rare-earth minerals will result in negotiations restarting, but not until after the European Parliament elections in mid-2024 and the Australian election in 2025.
What to watch- Deepening the trade relationship with India is a strategic priority for the Australian government. Negotiations are currently finalising a Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement that builds on the existing trade agreement. There remains huge potential in the relationship: Indian firms looking at Australia still predominately target Indian expats living there, while demand for Australian coal and solar technology is growing quickly. Australia is also supportive of expanding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacfic Partnership (CPTPP), a regional mega-trade deal, although discussions on facilitating China's potential ascension will remain complicated by other tensions in the Australia-China diplomatic relationship.

Full text: - Recep Tayyip Erdogan won the presidential election in May 2023, extending his 20 years in power. Mr Erdogan's ruling alliance won a majority in parliament at the same time. EIU expects Mr Erdogan to continue to make most decisions himself, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. He has tightened his grip on national institutions and the media, and will continue to dominate Turkish politics.
- Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional-rather than strategic-as Turkey performs a delicate balancing act between NATO, of which it is a member, and Russia over the latter's invasion of Ukraine. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) pursues a "Turkey first" approach to foreign relations and has the ambition to make Turkey a regional power. Turkey is at odds with its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean over maritime borders and offshore gas reserves.
- Domestic political tensions, fraught foreign relations and years of irrational economic policies have jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its previous electoral success. A slow return towards more rational economic policies under the new administration started in mid-2023. These new policies include policy rate increases and a more conservative approach to fiscal policy in an attempt to improve credibility with foreign investors. Interest-rate and exchange-rate controls have also been loosened.
- Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and market volatility, owing to a prudent approach to the public finances, effective capitalisation of the banking sector, and a dynamic and diversified private sector. Following real GDP growth 4.5% in 2023, we expect it to slow to 3.1% in 2024. We forecast average annual growth of 3.4% in our forecast period (2024-28), which is short of the government's annual 5% target but close to Turkey's medium-term potential.
- Turkey's heavy reliance on often volatile, short-term capital inflows to fund lending and drive economic growth leaves the economy vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Although capital inflows are improving and foreign-exchange reserves are picking up, investor sentiment remains fragile. The risk of a balance-of-payments crisis remains present.

- The business environment score for Turkey is lower in the forecast period than in the historical period (2019-23). Turkey falls nine places in the global ranking, to 55th, and one place to the bottom (18th) of the regional ranking.

Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The private sector benefits from incentives and support, but political bias, state enterprises, informality and intellectual property rights issues detract from free competition. Perception of corruption is high.
2026-28: Competition remains limited and/or state ownership continues to play an important role in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Turkey actively seeks foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in prioritised sectors, although the few existing restrictions remain in place.
2026-28: FDI remains a priority. FDI affecting natural resources or requiring special concessions may still face opposition.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The customs union with the EU largely dictates Turkey's trade policies, but tariff and non-tariff protection against imports of various products from non-EU countries without free-trade agreements continues.
2026-28: Exporters adjust to the EU "green deal". Politics permitting, talks on updating and expanding customs union begin.
Taxes 2024-25: Tax rates remain higher than in the past; for example some taxes on wealth may be increased. Efforts are made to reduce tax avoidance. Proposals are made to simplify incentives and increase the share of direct taxation.
2026-28: Tax reforms and anti-informality measures succeed only partially. Social-security deficit becomes more pressing.
Financing 2024-25: Banks manage their risks, but tighter monetary policies curb credit growth, while high inflation limits long-term lending. The authorities try to direct lending towards investments in digitalisation, greening and other priority areas.
2026-28: Financial conditions may ease. State banks still play a big role. Capital markets are promoted.
The labour market 2024-25: There is an ample supply of labour, but skill levels are mixed. The minimum wage keeps pace with inflation.
2026-28: Reforms to promote flexible employment remain incomplete or have a limited impact. Efforts continue to reduce informality and tackle skills gaps. The 2028 elections could be preceded by increases in real wages.
Infrastructure 2024-25: The Istanbul Airport expansion and the country's first nuclear reactor are operational. Black Sea gas production reaches full capacity. Earthquake-affected infrastructure is rebuilt. Other infrastructure investment is limited.
2026-28: Internet speeds improve. 5G mobile is rolled out. There is patchy progress on all forms of transport, nuclear and renewable energy, power supplies, and urban infrastructure. Vulnerability to earthquakes remains a critical issue.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Internet infrastructure and speeds improve. E-commerce grows. Research and development spending is moderate.
2026-28: High-tech industrial products increase. Businesses make wider use of IT, including AI.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade. Under current political circumstances accession will not be possible in 2024-28.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited, and its secular character has been weakened by the religious-conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule. There was a failed coup in July 2016. Turkey has a presidential system of government, in place since the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, changed the parliamentary system in 2018, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan, the AKP leader, who was re-elected for a third presidential term in May 2023.
Policy issues: The focus since mid-2023 has been on dismantling the irrational economic programme that started in 2021, characterised by ultra-low policy rates. The new economic programme emphasises the need for economic orthodoxy-including tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms-which will reassure investors. However, the process of rebalancing the economy comes with risk and will be gradual in order to prevent potential financial sector problems stemming from corporate and household debt levels. Negative real interest rates and political risk make attracting adequate capital inflows challenging, which means that risks of further lira sell-offs and a balance-of-payments crisis will persist. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is an important challenge. Politicisation of the judiciary has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was reverted back to 25% in 2023; it was 23% in 2022 and 25% in 2021. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 40%. The top marginal tax rate applies to 2023 incomes of more than TL1.9m (about US$60,000). Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2023 goods exports totalled US$250.8bn and imports about US$337.7bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$86.9bn. The current-account deficit reached an estimated US$45bn, or 4.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will remain in power until the next election, scheduled for 2028. The alliance led by Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a majority in parliament in May 2023, which will support political stability over EIU's forecast period. We expect consolidation of the country's centralised system of government and a reinforcement of conservative autocratic trends. Mr Erdogan will continue to make most decisions, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. The executive presidential system already grants extensive powers to the president, including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary. We expect Mr Erdogan to continue to restrict political dissent and media freedom, and to stifle the opposition.
Mr Erdogan will dominate Turkish politics throughout the forecast period through a mix of authoritarianism, control of state resources and bureaucracy, and a largely supportive domestic media. He is highly likely to remain in power beyond 2028, despite currently being barred by the constitution from serving another term.
The risk of social unrest has fallen significantly since the May 2023 elections, although a high degree of polarisation and still-elevated inflation will continue to fuel social discontent. In the event of serious unrest, it is uncertain whether Mr Erdogan would have the support of the security apparatus.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch Mr Erdogan won the 2023 presidential election with 52.2% of the vote. The election process appeared mostly free, but was largely unfair owing to strong media bias and restrictions on freedom of expression. Mr Erdogan's AKP-led alliance secured a parliamentary majority, but this was its worst performance since 2002.
On March 31st 2024 Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered substantial losses to the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) at local government elections. The AKP did not manage to win back Istanbul-Turkey's economic powerhouse and home to about a quarter of the electorate-and even lost some more provinces to the CHP (mainly western provinces). Although the result will revitalise the opposition, Mr Erdogan's power will remain largely unchecked.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Although Turkey is a NATO member and a candidate for EU accession, it will maintain an independent foreign policy that is likely to be transactional rather than strategic, and will often clash with the other members. Negotiations over EU accession are currently frozen, and Mr Erdogan will not make any efforts to satisfy the rule-of-law criteria. Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in this sphere. Foreign policy will also remain unpredictable to a degree, which will weigh on investor interest in Turkey.
We do not expect relations with Turkey's traditional Western allies (the EU and the US) and with NATO to collapse. However, there are multiple irritants. Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400 defence system in 2019 had already put severe strain on Turkish-US relations, leading to the introduction of mild US sanctions at end-2020. The West also fears that Turkey is helping Russia to bypass sanctions, and Turkey's continued pressure on NATO members to change their policies on Kurdish activism has created frictions. The main issues in Turkish-EU relations are human rights, Cyprus and territorial rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Nevertheless, Turkey needs the EU and the US on its side if it wants to attract global financial inflows and support for its economy. Meanwhile, the EU and the US are likely to refrain from sanctioning Turkey harshly, as Turkey is a critical security partner for the US in the region and a NATO ally, and is also a vital partner for the EU in managing migration. Many countries also have important commercial interests there.
Bilateral relations between Greece and Turkey have improved in 2023-24, as signalled by another recent meeting between the Greek prime minister and Mr Erdogan, on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington in July, their fifth meeting in the past year. The two countries have embarked on negotiations towards a "positive agenda" aimed at improving political and economic co-operation over energy, migration, trade and tourism. Agreement on more contentious issues, including maritime borders and Cyprus, is likely to stay out of reach. With Cyprus focused on developing its hydrocarbons resources, and a solution to the unification problem unlikely, Turkey's activity in the island's exclusive economic zone will continue to put it at odds with Cyprus, Greece and other regional players.
Mr Erdogan will continue to extend the country's influence in Central Asia and the South Caucasus-albeit without provoking Russia, with which it has developed closer economic and energy ties since 2016, despite some recent divergences around the Black Sea. From Turkey's perspective, forging closer ties with Russia, especially over energy imports and tourism, makes economic sense. Turkey's dire need for trade, tourism and financial investment has also pushed Mr Erdogan to deepen ties with non-traditional partners, particularly in the Middle East.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends The focus over the rest of 2024 will remain on the dismantling of the unorthodox economic programme that started in 2021. The new programme, which includes tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms, will reassure investors. These policies are designed to reduce inflation and improve external balances. The new economic programme also promises a floating currency and an inflation-targeting strategy.
After more than one year, interest rates have risen, credit growth has slowed, the real estate boom has ended, the current-account deficit has narrowed and the depreciation of the Turkish lira has steadied. Despite the policy U-turn, this does not mark a full return to economic policy orthodoxy. Some of the existing unorthodox banking regulations will remain, alongside the policy rate of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT), to control domestic demand. The re-establishment of the one-week repurchase rate as the main monetary policy instrument is not yet complete. Exchange-rate policy also remains non-transparent. Overall, we expect the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the CBT will still face political pressure for looser policies and consider other goals besides price stability.
We maintain our view that the current orthodox economic programme will be implemented until at least 2025. No major elections are due before 2028, and there is ample time for the AKP to reorganise itself after its defeat at the March local elections. Furthermore, Mr Erdogan has expressed a commitment to the existing government programme and to fighting inflation.
Risks of the orthodox economic programme being derailed remain high, especially as economic growth starts to slow and given Mr Erdogan's preference for ultra-low interest rates and loose fiscal policies, and the AKP's poor performance at the local elections. Past experience suggests that stringent policies, constraining consumption and economic growth, are unlikely to be politically sustainable, especially closer to elections. The risk of a return to looser policies will also increase if policymakers fail to impress potential foreign investors and financiers, endangering the net capital inflows that are needed to offset the current-account deficit and enable Turkey to keep servicing its private- and public-sector foreign debt (about 50% of GDP).
A derailment of the orthodox policy shift would affect confidence, and the risk of a full-blown economic crisis would rise again if the president reintroduced irrational economic policies. Meanwhile, the global outlook presents a downside risk, as it could hamper Turkey's ability to attract financial capital. Geopolitical conflicts and tensions are likely to affect the prospects for trade, finance and tourism. In the event of an economic crisis, capital and import controls could be imposed. Turkey's low public debt levels mean that the government would have room to provide assistance to banks or firms in such a scenario.
A balance-of-payments crisis will remain a risk in 2024-28. Turkey's high risk premium makes it hard for the country to attract sufficient capital inflows to offset its large current-account deficit and roll over its foreign debt. Capital inflows have been improving, and foreign-exchange reserves have picked up since June 2023. Mr Erdogan has been able to shore up Turkey's foreign-exchange reserves through swap and deposit agreements negotiated with non-Western countries. These politically motivated capital inflows, as well as some savings from delayed payments and discounted prices for Russian natural gas, are likely to be extended and augmented; they are, however, unpredictable, and investor sentiment will remain fragile. With Turkey unwilling to borrow from multilateral institutions, it will remain highly dependent on these political allies to avoid a potential balance-of-payments crisis.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy The public finances have been negatively affected by generous pay and pension increases, and by relief and reconstruction costs related to the 2023 earthquakes. In 2023 the budget deficit reached 5.3% of GDP. The fiscal deficit will narrow slightly to 5.2% of GDP in 2024. In July the Turkish parliament adopted a modest tax bill, which includes a minimum corporate income tax for large multinational firms and companies benefiting from tax incentives, that will support revenue. The administration is also taking steps to cut spending. We expect the deficit to narrow to 4.1% of GDP in 2025, as the new tax measures will be fully in force. However, slower growth could temper the increase in tax revenues and prompt new measures to support businesses and households.
We expect the deficit to narrow to an annual average of 3% of GDP in 2026-27 as the government reverts to a more prudent approach to the public finances. The deficit will widen again in 2028, as that will be an election year. The level of public debt remains easily manageable at 28.5% of GDP as at March 2024. Nonetheless, about two-thirds of this is denominated in foreign currency.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy At its August meeting the CBT maintained its main policy rate at 50%. It has raised rates by a cumulative 4,150 basis points since June 2023 (from 8.5%). The real policy rate remains negative, but it is probably sufficient to cool the economy, check inflation and support the lira. Bank interest rates have also risen sharply, and domestic demand has started to ease. We no longer expect the central bank to start cutting the policy rate in September, as monthly inflation remains high. We expect a modest rate cut before the end of the year given the weakening economy and potential political pressure. The CBT will continue winding down its interventions in the foreign-exchange market, and unpicking the many regulations that it has imposed on banks to deter the use of foreign currency and control the level and direction of credit. It will also continue making quantitative tightening decisions and using some macroprudential measures to keep credit growth sufficiently low and deposit interest rates sufficiently high to reduce inflation. An unjustified degree of policy loosening is likely by 2028. It could be brought forward if early elections become likely, the main opposition CHP increases its lead in opinion polls, or simply under pressure from public opinion, business interests or factions within the AKP.
We expect the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the CBT's independence remains limited, and the risk of political pressure for looser policies will persist.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth We expect economic growth to slow from 4.5% in 2023 to 3.1% in 2024, but this will still be significantly above the OECD average. Real GDP grew by a strong 4.5% year on year in the first quarter of 2024, indicating that the tighter, orthodox policies gradually introduced from June 2023 had not caused the economy to slow as at early 2024; however, we expect that they will curb domestic demand and slow economic growth from the second half of this year. The government has started to increase taxes and interest rates, and is limiting access to credit, which will affect consumer spending and government expenditure. Still-high inflation will also limit private consumption growth after credit-fuelled consumption in 2023. Fixed investment will continue to grow (although at a more modest pace), reflecting greater confidence in the direction of economic policy. With the government sticking to its relatively tight policies, the possibility of a harder landing than previously expected has increased.
Economic growth will accelerate slightly in 2025, in line with falling rates and a recovering global outlook, and will average 3.5% in 2025-28, which is close to Turkey's medium-term potential. We expect a stronger acceleration in 2028, as it is an election year and we expect Mr Erdogan to resort to his tactics of promoting faster economic activity for electoral advantage.
In the longer term Turkey will remain a fast-growing economy given its geographical location, sectoral diversity, appeal as a tourist destination, dynamic private sector and rapidly rising population. However, several factors expose the economy to external shocks, including its reliance on short-term capital inflows to meet the large external financing requirement, dependence on imported oil and gas, and limited foreign-currency reserves. Furthermore, Turkey's longer-term competitiveness will remain open to question. Talk of structural reforms to improve the attractiveness of the business environment has yet to be put into practice, and the political, administrative and justice systems will remain weak.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation We expect inflation to average just under 58% in 2024-the highest rate in the OECD. As expected, annual inflation peaked at more than 75% in May. Although it slowed to 61.8% in July owing to a base effect, the central bank's target of 38% for the end of 2024 remains over-optimistic. Inflationary pressures remain strong. Fiscal policy remains relatively loose, partly owing to earthquake reconstruction spending. Meanwhile, prices and-to a considerable extent-wages are being set with high inflationary expectations and past inflation in mind. However, interest rates are still below inflation, and will remain negative this year. Inflationary pressures will continue to abate slowly. Weaker domestic demand due to tighter monetary policy, a slightly firmer lira and falling inflationary expectations will also slow the trend in monthly inflation in the months ahead.
Further periodic bouts of lira weakness, persistent inflationary expectations, and high global prices for metals and critical minerals will keep inflation high, at an average of 18.2% per year in 2025-28. Overall, inflation will remain well above historical levels (of about 10%) and the central bank's target of 5% in 2024-28.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates The CBT has stepped back from currency intervention in order to bring the lira towards a more competitive level. The lira will continue to depreciate at a slow, steady pace for the rest of 2024, and we forecast a depreciation from TL29.5:US$1 at end-2023 to about TL51:US$1 at end-2028. Internal and external imbalances, still-elevated inflation, and tighter monetary policy in the US and the euro area will weigh on the currency, which we expect to keep weakening against the US dollar in nominal terms in 2024-28. Poor international relations, foreign investor concerns about the politicisation of the central bank and a reliance on short-term capital inflows will also weigh on the currency. Downside risks include a change in the administration's commitment to firm fiscal and incomes policies, as well as monetary policy. Global monetary policy may not ease as quickly as expected, which would, in turn, constrain inflows of financial capital. Higher than expected global oil prices could upset our forecasts for a dwindling current-account deficit and a slowdown in inflation.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector We expect the current-account deficit to narrow from 4.1% of GDP in 2023 to 2.7% in 2024, partly as a result of lower import demand. Easing global commodity prices should also curb the rise in import costs. Meanwhile, a still-strong tourism sector and a recovery in external demand will support trade and services exports. After a gradual narrowing to 2.3% of GDP in 2026, the current-account deficit will widen again in 2027-28 ahead of the elections in 2028. Attracting sufficient capital inflows to cover the deficit and service foreign debt without drawdowns of foreign-exchange reserves will remain a challenge.

Full text: - The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, achieved its third consecutive legislative election victory in 2024, extending its rule until 2029. Despite the BJP's reliance on a coalition to maintain a parliamentary majority, political stability will not be challenged owing to underlying policy synergies with key coalition partners. However, the small majority will hinder the enactment of major land and labour reforms, which will reduce business confidence. On the flip side, the BJP's smaller majority will be positive for social stability and reduce instances of communal strife over the forecast period (2024-28). India will seek closer strategic ties with the US and its allies without aligning itself, while balancing ties with Russia. Relations with China and Pakistan will remain strained.

- India's global and regional scores improve over the forecast period, primarily owing to strong economic growth, robust infrastructure development, technological advances and abundant market opportunities. India will outrank peers such as Vietnam and the Philippines, but will remain behind Thailand.

- India will remain one of the fastest-growing economies globally. Economic growth in fiscal years 2024/25-2027/28 (April-March) will average 6.5% per year, which will exceed many peers and steadily raise domestic income levels, although income inequality will rise. Growth will be led by private consumption and government investment, with increasing momentum from exports. Sector-specific improvements in private investment will ensue, while a degree of import dependence, especially on China, will remain. Despite coalition constraints, fiscal policy will eschew large-scale populist subsidies and focus on capital spending on infrastructure even as consolidation efforts continue through robust tax collections and dividends from state-owned enterprises. Monetary policy will loosen from end-2024, as inflation moderates. The Indian rupee will face continuous, albeit modest, depreciation pressure over the next five years, owing to the country's persistent current-account deficit. Strong foreign direct and portfolio investment will keep a floor under the extent of depreciation.

- A growing labour force will maintain a strong demographic dividend for India. However, reaping the full benefit of this will prove difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities, a wide gender imbalance and skill gaps. Continued rural to urban migration will add to existing pressures on urban infrastructure. Agriculture will continue to be a major employer of the rural population, although migrant labour will be increasingly absorbed by the construction and low-end manufacturing and services sectors. Upskilling of the urban workforce will continue with greater adoption of technology.

- Sustained growth in real GDP will support wage growth and assist the expansion of the middle class, even as GDP per head will remain low. Spending propensity will remain high in urban areas, and rural standards of living will also improve. Since 2023 luxury and premium consumer products have outperformed the mass-market segment, and EIU expects that more households will be able to afford premium products in 2024-28. The e-commerce sector will expand strongly, as higher smartphone and internet penetration boosts retail spending. Income inequality will increase, suppressing spending capacity of low- and middle-income households.

- India's economic growth will remain stronger than in many developing countries. The economic structure will gradually become less reliant on agriculture, with industry taking up a greater share, although it will remain a services-driven economy. Faster technological adoption, skilled labour and a large market will keep growth elevated, although growth will undershoot its potential owing to inadequate employment opportunities and slow adaptation to climate change. India's large economy will make it an increasingly influential diplomatic force, but India will maintain its non-aligned stance.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.4bn people in 2022, according to the UN. India stands as the fifth-largest economy in the world (measured in US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates), according to the World Bank, behind the US, China, Germany and Japan.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: The ruling BJP has made significant progress in passing structural reform since it came to power in 2014. Even as the BJP intended to liberalise laws related to land acquisition and streamline labour laws across the country, the party's small majority following the legislative election in 2024 will cause these contentious reforms to be shelved. Reforms such as reducing the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic sectors and leaving non-strategic sectors by privatising SOEs, have achieved moderate success, as have efforts to seal bilateral trade agreements. Economic liberalisation and trade promotion will remain policy priorities. The administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2024-28, including by further digitalising tax departments and linking permanent account numbers to identify tax evaders. This, coupled with a pick-up in economic growth, will support healthy tax collection. Reforms including a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017 have made India's tax system less complex, and the system is stable and predictable.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit narrowed from US$267.2bn in 2022 to US$243.8bn in 2023, as imports fell more steeply than exports amid subdued global demand. The services surplus rose from US$132.5bn to US$159.2n in the same period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is technically secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched and democratic elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades with clear, established and orderly transfers of power between governments. The country's two major political parties at the national level are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which has served in more governments than the BJP since independence, often in coalition with smaller regional parties.
The latest legislative election was held in April-June 2024, which returned the BJP-led NDA coalition to power for the third successive five-year term since 2014, with Narendra Modi continuing as the prime minister. However, the BJP lost its absolute majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), and relies upon NDA allies to retain power. EIU expects the BJP to successfully conclude its term in 2029 with the help of allies. A general policy synergy among the ruling partners will help to maintain political stability. The BJP's continuous stint in government since 2014 will ensure large-scale policy continuity at the national level.
The opposition Congress, which has a more centre-left ideological approach to socioeconomic issues, saw a resurgence in popular support in the 2024 legislative election. The party aligned with a number of regional parties to form an opposition bloc to the NDA, named the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), and recorded a surprisingly strong electoral performance, although it fell short of defeating the BJP. However, Congress' reliance on support from regional parties will continue, as it is plagued by long-standing problems, including policy paralysis, corruption and dynastical politics that have eroded its public support. Its de facto leader, Rahul Gandhi, has inconsistent support in different regions of the country, and falls significantly short of Mr Modi's popularity rating.
Over the past few years regional parties have increasingly gained prominence in many state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics. These parties will increasingly become kingmakers and form significant support pillars for the BJP and Congress in government and the opposition respectively, allowing them to secure benefits for their individual states at the expense of equity in nationwide policies. Regional parties often overshadow the national parties in terms of state-level influence. Currently, key states including West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have governments led by regional parties.

Political outlook: Political stability The outlook for political stability in 2024-28 has deteriorated since the general election held in April-June 2024. The ruling NDA, led by the BJP and Narendra Modi, the prime minister, won with a narrow majority and returned to office for a third consecutive term. The alliance now commands 292 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament), narrowly exceeding the majority mark of 272 seats required to form the government. The BJP will remain dependent on its major coalition allies to govern and implement its policy agenda, but this will leave the alliance vulnerable to defections over our forecast period. We nonetheless expect the BJP-led government to complete its term in office in 2029.
Congress, which forms the main national opposition, increased its parliamentary representation in the 2024 election. The Congress-led opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 234 seats, helped largely by the strong performance of regional opposition leaders in states like West Bengal, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. The importance of regional leaders in Indian politics will continue to grow, creating new contenders for national roles. However, Congress will struggle to address long-standing internal hierarchy issues that constrain the party's appeal.
The current parliamentary situation has raised the risk of legislative impasse in 2024-28, with the ruling coalition's narrow majority complicating the passage of business-oriented land and labour reforms. We expect the opposition to use its enhanced numbers to block portions of the government's legislative agenda, including contentious social reforms such as the Uniform Civil Code-a proposal that risks widening religious and political divisions. Such reforms will now be impossible, owing to limited support from coalition allies on this topic, although we view the halting of the Uniform Civil Code as positive for social stability. The government's control over public institutions and the media will recede modestly, as a result of stronger oversight and political checks and balances exercised by the strengthened opposition.
Extremist organisations in Kashmir will keep the threat of terrorist attacks elevated, ensuring a heavy security presence in the region. However, this will not disrupt business activity in the country.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The BJP-led NDA coalition retained its office after the legislative election in 2024. However, the BJP lost a large number of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), which has led it to depend on coalition allies to remain in office. The BJP dominates the political landscape in half of the nation's state assemblies, and this centre-regional political consistency reduces policy disconnect at the regional level. The NDA coalition currently falls short of a majority in the upper house, and it is unlikely to secure enough seats to dominate that chamber in our forecast period (2024-28). However, co-operation with non-aligned parties will allow most bills to pass in the upper house.
The BJP-led coalition's small majority in the lower house of the parliament will affect its ability to carry out reforms in select areas through the parliamentary channel. Large-scale business-oriented reforms related to easing land acquisition rules, uniform adoption of labour laws across states, privatisation and asset monetisation will now face legislative obstructions. However, we do not expect any form of policy paralysis or parliament impasses like those seen before 2014.
Policy areas that largely operate beyond the remit of parliament will be unimpeded by the low majority. These will include developing defence capabilities, promoting the adoption of technology and digitisation, formulating policies for green energy transition, provision of subsidised loans to small industries, and sealing bilateral trade agreements will remain policy priorities. Infrastructure spending will gradually moderate owing to fiscal constraints, but will remain an important area of focus. Flagship initiatives to strengthen India's manufacturing sector will also continue to be a priority of industrial policies.
The government's narrow parliamentary majority means that it will not be possible for the BJP to amend the Indian Constitution. This will prevent the BJP from undertaking intended changes to social policies such as the Uniform Civil Code, One Nation One Election and the National Register of Citizens to identify illegal immigrants to India. This will be positive for social stability, reducing the potential of social tensions and religious skirmishes.
The BJP's ideological inclination leans towards Hindu nationalism, mixing social conservatism with a more active foreign and security policy. The BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda continues to appeal to the country's large Hindu majority, particularly in the populous Hindi-speaking belt of north India. The BJP's policy mix also includes targeted welfare provision without indulging in large-scale populism, with a preference for groups like women, young people, farmers and rural migrants. The BJP's smaller majority will increase the difficulty of pursuing their domestic agenda, which, in turn, can lead to a less aggressive foreign policy than seen over the past decade.
At the state level, the BJP will perform inconsistently, winning some but losing other states, as state-level election agenda and priorities vary considerably from those at the national level. The party's failure to create sufficient employment opportunities will intermittently undermine its performance in state elections.
The BJP has been an advocate of competitive federalism, which encourages competition between India's states. We believe that this approach will lead to an improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west of the country. However, it is also likely to deepen economic disparities between India's more economically successful states and its laggards, increasing social friction, competition for fiscal resources and pressure for migration between regions.
The BJP's popularity is underpinned by the popularity of the prime minister, Mr Modi, who belongs to the party. However, his public support has ebbed in the face of economic hardships, made evident in the ballot for 2024. During his term over the past decade, Mr Modi has overseen consolidation of power and diluted checks and balances in India's federal structure. These areas will now have greater autonomy owing to the BJP's weaker parliamentary position. The strengthening of the opposition alliance's parliamentary position after a decade of BJP rule demonstrates the perseverance of a healthy democratic process in India, which will keep the government and the opposition wary of complacency. The judiciary is one of the better functioning institutions with a strong independent streak, and judges have been vocally critical of the government's actions in the recent past. Corruption at the level of local government bodies and tardiness in the bureaucracy will persist over 2024-28.
Political outlook: Election watch The general election was held in seven stages between April and June. India follows a first-past-the-post electoral system in which candidates for a constituent seat need only to secure the most votes to win, rather than a majority of the votes. The next general election is scheduled for 2029. The ruling alliance and the opposition will contest local assembly elections in states such as Haryana and Maharashtra later this year, which will be the first major test for either side following the general election.
Mr Modi, India's prime minister since 2014, assumed a third consecutive term in June. His inflammatory rhetoric during the election, alongside his administration's mishandling of the pandemic and public dissatisfaction with job-creation policies, contributed to the BJP losing its single-party majority. The opposition's claim that a large BJP majority would pave the way for a change in the Indian constitution, to the detriment of lower castes and minority religions, resonated with voters, as did its promise to carry out a caste survey to craft welfare schemes and allow redistributive wealth policies.
Political outlook: International relations The BJP's reduced parliamentary majority will distract it from focusing on major foreign policy objectives over 2024-28. Most notably, its plan to position India as a leader for developing nations on the global stage through platforms such as the G20 and BRICS will take a back seat.
We expect Donald Trump to win the US presidential election in 2024. This will have a detrimental impact on the migration of personnel between India and the US, as the new administration will tighten immigration policies. Bilateral defence co-operation will expand, as it did during Mr Trump's previous term. Broader diplomatic and defence ties with the US and its allies will deepen through forums such as the Quad, an informal diplomatic grouping that also includes Japan and Australia. Deepening ties with the US will also boost co-operation on critical technology in areas such as semiconductor production and defence. India will not align itself formally with the US, to allow space for its domestic considerations. The government will maintain its neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, given its traditionally strong diplomatic, trade and defence relations with Russia, although we expect it to reduce its reliance on Russian arms in 2024-28.
Strengthening ties with Gulf nations will remain a priority. An anticipated trade deal with Oman in 2024 will help to secure access to the Strait of Hormuz-a major transit point for global oil shipments. India will maintain a balanced approach towards the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, considering the country's ties with both the US and Gulf nations.
Relations with China will remain tense amid persistent mistrust, which will contribute to elevated risk of another low-level military clash. Continued strains in ties with Pakistan will be underpinned by persistent cross-border terrorism and a decades-long sovereignty dispute over Kashmir.

Overview: India's overall score in EIU's business environment ranking rises to 6.59 in 2024-28, from 5.5 in 2019-23, propelling the country's rise in global and regional ranks. Regional peers Malaysia and Thailand still rank higher than India, but India will overtake the Philippines, Vietnam and China in the quality of business environment. The biggest improvements will stem from continued efforts on trade liberalisation, foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitation and infrastructure and technological upgrades and robust financial markets.
Strengths: India's main strengths are market opportunities and the macroeconomic environment, which has sustained strong growth. India is the only single-country market that offers a potential scale comparable to that of China. Alongside intrinsic capabilities including solid economic fundamentals, a sound digital infrastructure and favourable demographics, qualified policy support to attract manufacturing investment is available.
Weaknesses: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition's reduced parliamentary majority will stymie the enactment of bold factor reforms related to land and labour, which will sour business appetite. Decades of underfunding has led to insufficient transport and logistical infrastructure, which will continue to prevent the economy from reaching its full potential. However, significant public investment has been made in this area in recent years, and the outlook is constructive. India's political environment will remain a constraint, as bureaucracy and red tape persist, and policy inconsistency at a federal level remains making the policy environment across states heterogeneous.
What to watch
- Policymaking in certain areas like factor reforms, privatisation, asset monetisation and data privacy norms, among others, will be protracted and unpredictable as the considerably reduced majority of the NDA will weaken its ability to enact legislation on its own terms, and adhere to coalition requirements. Parliamentary gridlock on business reforms will weigh on investor confidence.
- India will gradually seal bilateral trade deals with more countries such as the UK, Oman, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as multilateral treaties with regional blocs such as the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council, by the end of our forecast period, which will widen India's export markets.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The government maintains its drive to privatise inefficient state-owned companies and monetise infrastructure assets. Both will face resistance from the parliament owing to coalition constraints and a stronger opposition.
2026-28: The rationalisation of liquidation and bankruptcy laws continues. Government initiatives to encourage start-ups in emerging sectors such as electric-vehicle components and renewable energy pick up pace.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Production Linked Incentive schemes are tweaked to encourage domestic production; the schemes are extended to more sectors, such as chemicals and shipping grade containers. Restrictions remain in place against Chinese investment.
2026-28: Foreign investment in export manufacturing and e-commerce increases markedly.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The government continues to support domestic manufacturing via tariff and non-tariff barriers.
2026-28: A diluted free-trade agreement is finalised with the EU, and a broader Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement is signed with Australia. The usage of the local currency, the rupee, for international trade rises gradually.
Taxes 2024-25: Corrections are made to the inverted duty structure (inputs being taxed more highly than final output) under the goods and services tax regime, while formalisation increases. This expands the tax base.
2026-28: The government brings more individuals and corporations under the tax ambit.
Financing 2024-25: The inclusion of Indian bonds on global indices boosts foreign capital inflows.
2026-28: Consolidation continues. Equity markets remain attractive despite higher capital gains taxes and overvaluation.
The labour market 2024-25: Registrations under the rural employment scheme fall. Minimum wage laws remain loose and unrestrictive.
2026-28: The technological ability of the skilled labour force continues to improve. A greater pool of skilled workers is available as stricter visa regulations reduce the Indian "brain drain".
Infrastructure 2024-25: Major infrastructure projects in the road and airport sectors are completed. Residential uptake of solar grids accelerates under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana programme.
2026-28: The construction of defence and industrial corridors are completed.
Technological readiness 2024-25: The rollout of 5G technology accelerates. There is further progress on digitalising the delivery of public services, in order to cut corruption and promote "last-mile delivery".
2026-28: The use of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence accelerates. The government announces the next phase of its cybersecurity strategy, as reliance on digital infrastructure increases.

Overview: India's score for the macroeconomic environment category rises from 6.9 to 7.8 in 2024-28, placing it higher in the regional ranking than Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The country's macroeconomic environment will remain resilient, characterised by robust GDP growth. India is largely a domestic-driven economy, which makes it less exposed to external financial and demand-related shocks, although it will intermittently be affected by commodity-related supply-chain disruptions. The economy will display strong growth by emerging-market standards, continued fiscal consolidation and low financial market volatility, which will support the score. The external sector will benefit from consistently strong export growth, but the current account will remain in deficit throughout the forecast period.
Strengths: India's economic growth will remain strong compared to most emerging-market peers, at just below 6.5% per year over the forecast period-one of the fastest growing major economies. India's improving income levels and aspirational population will create significant market opportunities, underpinning its attractiveness for foreign investment inflows. Continued fiscal consolidation, deep foreign-exchange reserves and the low exposure to exchange-rate risks of the government debts (they are largely domestically owned) will ensure solid debt repayment capacities.
Weaknesses: The twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will persist, keeping the domestic currency on a depreciatory trend over much of the forecast period. Inflation will intermittently arise as a problem owing to a lack of supply-chain resilience to extreme weather conditions. India's significant import dependence for petroleum, gold, raw materials and machinery will also continue, keeping it susceptible to global supply-chain disruptions.
What to watch
- Internationalisation of the rupee will gradually pick up speed. This will mitigate exchange-rate volatility, reduce the current-account deficit and incentivise foreign investment inflows.
- The government will pursue an aggressive fiscal consolidation plan over the forecast period and will successfully meet its target of narrowing the budget deficit to under 4.5% of GDP by fiscal year 2025/26 (April-March). Healthy growth in tax receipts, as well as the transfer of large bounties from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank), will enable fiscal consolidation, which will, in turn, reduce market borrowing needs and buoy debt markets.

Overview: India's score in this category improves from 4.5 to 6 in 2024-28 to push it up the regional table by one spot, placing India between Vietnam and Malaysia. The government will facilitate business competition in sectors like shipping, financial services transport, steel and energy, which will bolster opportunities in these sectors. Insufficient protection of intellectual property and the persistence of business lobbying, which gives large corporates an edge, will remain drags on the score.
Strengths: Deregulation of most prices in the economy, including sensitive commodities in the petroleum sector, will strengthen market mechanisms to determine prices. The initiative to monetise infrastructure assets in sectors like roads, railways and energy will continue, albeit at a slower pace. The monetisation of public-sector brownfield assets including coal blocks and other mineral assets, highway stretches and power network will gain momentum. The government has encouraged competition among states by allowing them to experiment on pro-business liberalisation over and beyond the regulations imposed centrally. Legal framework and regulations to protect the interest of minority shareholders will be strengthened further; and private property rights will remain well-protected.
Weaknesses: The BJP-led government in its third term will slow its efforts to privatise state-owned enterprises amid resistance from coalition partners. Market-friendly reforms are likely to face resistance from vested interest groups. Measures to reduce red tape and facilitate the ease of doing business will achieve limited success. Delays to planned privatisation and sales will remain a constant risk, amid opposition from labour unions, a lack of private-sector participation and issues with valuation. Powerful lobbies with vested interests will distort government policies. Protection of intellectual property will remain poor and weigh on research and development (R&D) activities.
What to watch
- Government will seek to implement a new digital competition law that could stop tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon (all US) from promoting their own services over competitors, or using data gathered from one company to benefit another group company. The proposed law will be based on an ex-ante framework, which sets presumptive norms to curb anti-competitive practices before they actually take place, and will impose heavy penalties for violations.
- The protection of intellectual property will improve gradually, reflecting pressure from domestic companies to toughen enforcement as local levels of investment in R&D increase. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy.

Overview: India's score for policy towards foreign investment improves substantially to 7.3 in 2024-28, from 5.5 in 2019-23, putting its rank on a par with Malaysia and Japan, and above Vietnam and the Philippines. The gains will be made by a more liberal regime towards foreign investment, as well as interest from multinationals to diversify supply chains beyond China, in conjunction with government policy to make India a more attractive manufacturing destination. Meanwhile, investor protections will strengthen from a low base.
Strengths: The BJP-led coalition government has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime since 2014 and its commitment to attract foreign capital will continue, with more incentives and streamlined regulations. The country offers fiscal incentives to foreign investors, encompassing benefits such as tax concessions, import of capital goods at concessional customs duty, special economic zones (SEZs), bilateral investment protection agreements with investing countries and, subsidies for setting up R&D facilities. Apart from the traditional services and software sectors, foreign investment will continue to branch out to include infrastructure, telecommunications, automobile, energy and domestic trade. India's large domestic market, which is the only one comparable to China, will remain lucrative for foreign investors looking to capture it. The loosening of rules regarding government approvals, strong growth and low costs will continue to increase India's attractiveness to international investors.
Weaknesses: Hard caps and onerous approval processes will remain in place for some important sectors, such as multi-brand retail, banking, pensions and media. The country will face intense competition for FDI from emerging markets in South-east Asia, many of whom offer more mature incentives than India. The impact of liberalisation efforts will filter through slowly, owing in part to excessive bureaucratic red tape, as well as overhanging impediments in areas related to land acquisition and labour laws. India's slow and onerous judicial system will continue to undermine investor confidence.
What to watch
- Given the geopolitical tensions between India and China in recent years, there has been heightened scrutiny of Chinese investment and business operation in India. The Indian government will limit the scope and reach of investment from China as much as possible, and these companies will be exposed to some stringent observation to ensure adherence to Indian FDI rules.
- A gradual pick-up in foreign investment in the renewable energy sector will take place in the forecast period, as India seeks more climate-friendly investments to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by2070. Solar and wind energy projects will be the major areas for investment.

Overview: The score for this category strengthens in 2024-28, though India still ranks behind Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. The improvement is attributable to implementation of government schemes to facilitate foreign trade. Although import reliance and tariff and non-tariff barriers will persist, progress will happen on bilateral free-trade agreements, while some modest liberalisation of the capital account will proceed.
Strengths: In recent years the government has reduced an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under a general scheme for goods and services. It has also invested in infrastructure; reduced costs through greater use of online platforms; permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures; and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Benefits of trade agreements concluded in the past years will filter through in the forecast period. The country has substantial foreign-exchange reserves, which makes the likelihood of foreign-exchange controls being implemented negligible.
Weaknesses: Tariff and non-tariff barriers remain high in certain areas of domestic focus or on security grounds. India will remain shy of participating in multilateral free-trade agreements on concerns of dumping and employment losses. India will remain reluctant to open up lucrative services and consumer-facing industries to foreign participants, and will demand greater mobility rights for its nationals, which will remain a major obstacle to trade talks. India remains protective of the agricultural sector, and regulatory barriers are high for the import of food and agricultural products. We expect the government to continue to sanction tariffs on selected manufactured goods in the coming years to promote domestic production. Amid concerns about Chinese goods flooding Indian markets via free-trade agreements with third countries, India will continue to push for strong rules of origin clauses in its trade negotiations.
What to watch
- Bilateral free-trade negotiations will move ahead in the forecast period. We expect ongoing negotiations with partners such as the EU, the Gulf Co-operation Council, Israel, Oman and the UK to be concluded, at least in early harvest form, by 2025-26 at the latest.
- The country is likely to expand non-tariff trade barriers (like local content requirements) to promote local manufacturing in areas of strategic importance such as renewables, automotive, steel, textile and pharmaceuticals.
- India will seek to curtail imports from China (its largest foreign supplier of goods) amid strained Indo-Sino ties, as well as boost domestic manufacturing. Chinese imports will face trade barriers despite thriving domestic sectors such as electronics, where Chinese firms have captured market share. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China or the US) is likely to encourage trade diversification over the medium term.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 17 geographies: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: India's score for this category improves over the forecast period, allowing it to climb three places in the regional ranking, placing it between Bangladesh and Japan. India's tax system is still fairly complex despite persistent attempts to streamline it. However, the tax regime is predictable and stable. The tax net excludes a large number of people working in the informal sector, which keeps the tax base narrow vis-à-vis the size of the country. However, in recent years the government has used digital avenues to link identity and incomes to taxation dues, thereby expanding the tax base substantially. Tax revenues have steadily climbed over the years. We expect the overall tax system to become more equitable and progressive over time.
Strengths: India's gross tax buoyancy (the ratio of tax growth to GDP growth) has exceeded 1 in recent years, showing a significant rise in taxation levels, especially since the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, which harmonised indirect taxes and created a more unified national single market. The top marginal tax rate for individuals will remain competitive at 30% in the forecast period. In its budget for 2024/25 the government sanctioned tax cuts to boost manufacturing investment in key industries such as electronics, solar cells and panels, and the jewellery sector (an important export sector).
Weaknesses: Tax enforcement is weak and inconsistent, but more standardised tax collection and a crackdown on grey areas are likely to mean a higher tax burden for many businesses. The taxation system is also prone to endemic corruption, which further heightens compliance risks. Tax filing remains a complex task. Under the GST, an inverted duty structure persists, wherein inputs are taxed at a higher rate than the final good or service.
What to watch
- To incentivise foreign businesses and investors to manufacture in India, the government has lowered the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40% to 35%. We believe that the policy measure will facilitate increasing foreign investment into the country.
- The GST Council will continue to take measures to simplify the tax system and streamline rates in the forecast period. Specifically, a rationalisation of GST rates could take the form of more items moving into lower tax brackets. Several key items, including petroleum products, will remain outside the GST coverage.

Overview: In the financing category, an improvement in India's score in 2024-28 leads the country to rise up in the regional rank, overtaking Vietnam, Bangladesh and Indonesia, and climbs 12 places in the global rank. The improvement will be led by foreign entities enjoying much greater access to the country's capital markets and fewer financial market distortions. Implementation of recently enacted stricter data protection laws will push banks and other financial institutions to invest in robust compliance frameworks and data protection technologies and provide customers greater transparency and control over personal data.
Strengths: India's banking sector is relatively stable, buttressed by large state-owned lenders that often receive direct government support in times of stress. Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, even as privatisation accelerates. Both public- and private-sector banks are well capitalised and are compliant with Basel III capital-adequacy standards. Banks have consistently seen a reduction in non-performing assets (NPAs) over the past few years. The capital market is well-developed and provides good access to equity financing for domestic and foreign businesses. Non-bank financiers have improved their liquidity and provisional buffers, and are regulated with greater oversight since a crisis in 2018. The financial technology sector has thrived, with foreign ownership of up to 100% being allowed for financial services and technology players.
Weaknesses: Access to bank credit for some businesses is constrained in part by a long-standing policy to guarantee access to select industries, under a system known as priority-sector lending, which entails minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives. Regulation of capital markets is sub-par relative to their size, and poses risks of volatility arising from insufficient oversight. A surge in payment-related scams has highlighted growing concerns regarding cyber-crime, which could erode public confidence in banks and payment infrastructure.
What to watch
- Digitisation of financial services dissemination as lenders adopt innovative digital operating models leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, complemented by a deeper penetration of internet usage, will improve access to the formal financial system.
- Indian bonds were included in the JP Morgan global bond index in June 2024, and further inclusion in other indices such as Bloomberg will follow in 2025. This inclusion, which opens up a large debt market for foreigners, will gradually deepen and broaden India's insular debt market by diversifying the investor base and lead to strong inflows into local currency-denominated government debt, tempering bond yields and supporting the domestic currency.

Overview: India's labour market score improves, pushing up its global ranking by 18 places and regional ranking to 10th; the latter surpassing Vietnam, Indonesia and South Korea. Improvement in the forecast period will stem from a higher-quality labour force, particularly in terms of skills and health outcomes, albeit from a weak starting point, as well as a less challenging cost of living environment, which will keep wage growth modest. The country's historically strict labour laws were materially streamlined in 2019-20.
Strengths: India boasts a young demographic with a lower median age than China, promising good availability of labour. There is a healthy supply of low-to-semi-skilled workers and the cost of hiring locally is cheap by global standards. Companies operating in states that have adopted simplified labour codes will face easier compliance by ensuring a single licensing mechanism for industries; they also provide operational flexibility for small and medium-sized enterprises. These companies have also introduced faster dispute-resolution mechanisms. With minimum-wage norms not being prevalent across Indian industries, the cost of labour, particularly for low-end manufacturing, is likely to remain modest.
Weaknesses: A low participation rate remains a weakness, as it consistently falls short of 50%, below peer economies, mainly because female participation in the labour force remains low. Educational attainment is uneven by region and gender. There is also a gap between academia and the industry, which businesses need to invest in training and skill development programmes.
What to watch
- Labour force participation is expected to increase in the coming years as society adapts to new norms and participation of women in the labour force improves across levels. This will ensure an abundant supply of labour in the market and will keep inflationary pressures on wage costs low.

Overview: India's score in the infrastructure category improves from 4.3 to 5.5 in the forecast period, on the back of a relatively broad-based improvement in digital and physical infrastructure through substantial government-led investment. Consequently, India rises by seven positions in the global ranking, and by two places in the regional ranking, overtaking Vietnam and the Philippines. We expect India to make strides in construction and the upgrade of roads and highways in 2024-28 and-to a lesser extent-air and sea transport infrastructure, leading to an overall improvement in infrastructural availability. Supply of power will also be more reliable in the forecast period as coal offtake and throughput increase.
Strengths: The BJP-led government has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving infrastructure across India. In the past few years budget allocation towards infrastructure-related capital spending has nearly doubled. Flagship initiatives such as Bharatmala (a network of cross-country roads and highways), Sagarmala (connecting and developing port infrastructure), Udaan (the development of regional airports) and the National Infrastructure Pipeline (a set of infrastructure projects to be undertaken by 2025) will progress. Mobile network coverage is high, facilitating internet-based activities.
Weaknesses: Infrastructure projects have historically been plagued by delays and budget overruns, frequently resulting in incomplete projects of substandard quality. Despite expedited government clearances for industrial projects in recent years, difficulties in land acquisition continue to be an obstacle. The public transport network is inadequate and dated, and major cities are plagued with issues like overcrowding and poor maintenance of infrastructure.
What to watch
- The government will focus on areas like reliable and consistent electricity supply, intermodal freight transfers, and inland waterways. Industrial corridors being developed across the country will smooth logistical challenges.
- To encourage states to undertake infrastructure development projects, the national government in its budget for 2024/25 has earmarked Rs1.5trn (US$180bn) for long-term interest-free loans to the states. It will seek to attract private-sector investment through viability gap funding, as well as supportive policies and regulations.

Overview: India's score for technological readiness improves to 6.3 in the forecast period, with its global rank rising from 56th to 50th place. However, in the regional rankings it drops by one place to 11th owing to faster improvements in countries like China. Internet accessibility and speed will continue improving, which will be complemented by an increase in the delivery of government services online and a more conducive environment for e-commerce. However, greater coverage will expose individuals and businesses to more cyber-security risks.
Strengths: India boasts a relatively advanced R&D infrastructure, owing in part to the education system's historical bias towards higher education institutions. This has facilitated the development of research-intensive sectors. Charges for telecoms and internet services are low, making them broadly affordable for even poorer households. Currently, 5G services are available to most major urban centres and rural access will improve rapidly in the forecast period. According to the Speedtest Global Index, in June 2024 India was ranked 12th out of 108 countries for mobile internet connectivity speed. India also has a high adoption rate for e-government, e-commerce and digital payment systems.
Weaknesses: The government's restrictions on e-commerce businesses will remain in place over the next few years to protect small bricks-and-mortar businesses, and policies could be unpredictable. Cyber-security threats have been rising in frequency and intensity, and individuals and organisations are vulnerable. A report by a US cyber-security firm, Zscaler, ranked India as the third-largest country globally for phishing attacks after the US and the UK.
What to watch
- China's stakes in Indian start-ups and technology companies will remain a major concern related to the protection of intellectual property rights, data privacy and national security. The Indian government will remain vigilant on potential technology transfers and enact laws in this regard.
- Emerging technologies in the Indian economy include blockchain, which has the potential to disrupt industries such as banking, healthcare, logistics and real estate. The adoption of artificial intelligence, robotics and other digital technology alternatives across healthcare, finance, manufacturing and agriculture will accelerate.
- The government will work towards projecting India as an investment and production destination for high-tech industries, including clean energy, medical devices, drones, semiconductors, and other ICT hardware, through incentives.

Economic forecast: Policy trends EIU expects the narrow parliamentary majority of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to have a small negative effect on business confidence, given the impediments that the party will face in passing and implementing select reforms via the parliamentary channel. Large-scale business-oriented reforms related to easing land acquisition, uniform adoption of labour laws across states, privatisation and asset monetisation will face legislative obstructions. Policymaking hurdles will present a modest setback to India's ambition to compete with South-east Asian nations for foreign and supply-chain investment in the context of "de-risking" from China. Areas such as trade pacts, digitalisation, renewable energy promotion, housing and road development, sanitation and subsidised loans to small industries will nevertheless capture bipartisan support. More generally, India's strong growth and vast market will continue to underpin overall positive business sentiment.
Key infrastructure initiatives will include the expansion of the national highway network (under the Bharatmala project), the development of multi-modal logistics parks and increased investment in railways and airports. These efforts will help gradually to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks in the country, but much of the benefit will materialise later in the forecast period. The government's digitalisation efforts in agriculture, to improve the efficiency of farmer-oriented credit-related schemes and facilitate digital crop surveys, will make slow progress because of the challenges of last-mile policy delivery in rural areas. Authorities will consider easing export restrictions on rice by the last quarter of 2024, because of an anticipated moderation in food inflation with the arrival of the kharif (July-October) harvest and overflowing government rice stocks.
The BJP will maintain its focus on galvanising India's manufacturing sector through industrial policies. Refining and expanding the government's flagship Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, which are operational in 14 sectors of the economy, will continue, including through increased fiscal outlay. So far the scheme has been successful in sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, telecommunication equipment, food processing and white goods. The nascent chip industry in India will be a major policy focus, with continued state support for legacy chip manufacturing via subsidies, partnerships with global players and knowledge transfer through increased foreign investment.
India will progress slowly towards its climate goals, which include reaching net-zero emissions by 2070. This will be balanced against imperatives such as economic development, poverty eradication and access to the finance and raw materials (largely controlled by China) required to transition sustainably. The National Hydrogen Mission, which targets India's development into a green hydrogen hub, and the construction of an electric vehicle (EV) charging grid will gain some focus. Sustainability will be pursued in sectors like steel, cement, metals and engineering goods, although limited funding avenues will prevent any serious greening of these industries over the 2020s.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP: fiscal years beginning Apr 1st of year indicated)
  2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028

Budget balance -5.6 -4.9 -4.4 -4.0 -3.7 -3.5
Government debt 53.1 53.3 53.4 52.9 52.6 52.2
We forecast that the government's budget deficit will narrow to 4.9% of GDP in fiscal year 2024/25 (April-March). The government will surpass its budgeted revenue targets, underpinned by robust tax receipts amid strong economic activity. At the same time, it plans to keep a check on outlays for pensions, subsidies and major schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The budgeted spending for these measures in 2024/25 has not been raised substantially from the estimated outlay in 2023/24, despite the market's previous expectation that the government would increase welfare spending following its narrow election victory.
A trend of rising revenue surplus transfers from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank), nationalised banks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will further bolster the government's coffers, helping to offset shortfalls in budgeted disinvestment receipts. These large transfers, coupled with the expectation that the government will refrain from a welfare-oriented budget in the forecast period, will ensure faster consolidation of the public finances.
Fiscal consolidation will continue steadily over 2024-28. The government will broaden the tax base by using digital records and will strengthen tax compliance (with incentives such as input tax credits) to help consolidate the public finances. Fiscal considerations will also prompt a reduction in large government capital outlays in successive budgets. Although public debt will average about 55% of GDP in 2024-28, most of this will be held domestically, reducing exchange-rate risks associated with external debt repayment.

Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 14.7 14.6 12.9 11.4 10.3 9.5

Long-term interest rate (year-end) 7.3 7.0 6.7 6.2 6.0 5.7
We forecast that the RBI will cut the policy interest rate (the repo rate) by 25 basis points to 6.25% in the last quarter of 2024, as it takes account of easing momentum behind consumption and investment growth. Elevated consumer price inflation has yet to moderate close to the central bank's medium-term target of 4%, which has prevented the RBI from easing monetary policy. The anticipated start of US monetary policy easing from September will further limit the likelihood of the RBI reducing policy rates before the last quarter of 2024. The central bank has maintained the policy rate at 6.5%-its highest level since 2016-since the conclusion of the tightening cycle in February 2023. Anticipated normal monsoon rains and the arrival of fresh crops in the market by October will ease high food inflation in the second half of 2024. This will provide room for the central bank to begin lowering the repo rate from October.
Rate reductions from late 2024 will eventually bring the policy rate to 5% by end-2026. This will relieve some pressure on households and businesses from early 2025. Robust medium-term growth and a benign inflationary outlook will help the RBI to maintain the policy rate at 5% in 2027-28.

We forecast that real GDP growth will slow to 6.9% in 2024/25, from 8.2% in 2023/24. Household consumption will be increasingly oriented towards services rather than goods, with high demand for travel and leisure activities. Credit growth to households will remain strong over 2024/25, despite high interest rates, reflecting improved market confidence. Interest rates will remain elevated over the first half of 2024/25, limiting the recovery in private investment. However, the government's substantial outlays on infrastructure will ensure continued growth in overall investment via public channels. Robust export growth, particularly for categories such as pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics, will also support economic activity.
The manufacturing sector will be supported by a moderation of commodity prices. A rise in crude oil prices, coupled with higher freight costs for imports (due to disruption in the Red Sea), will weigh on activity in the electronics, automotive and capital goods sectors in the near term. Demand strength and the rising intake of new business will support strong growth in the service sector.
Infrastructure development will have strong multiplier effects on growth over 2025-28 by boosting India's operational environment. A trend of supply-chain diversification by international firms will support medium-term growth in the manufacturing sector as firms extend their operations into India. The country will maintain its competitive edge in wages because of the plentiful supply of low-skilled labour in the manufacturing and construction sectors. However, the shortage of skilled personnel for advanced manufacturing will hinder progress in industries like automotive and green energy. Government initiatives to promote scientific warehousing and capital investment will support medium-term growth in the primary sector, but its share of GDP will nonetheless continue to decline. Labour productivity will also be weighed down by a large proportion of the population remaining employed in agriculture, limiting income growth among rural groups and, by extension, their purchasing power.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The acceleration of India's post-pandemic GDP growth was driven by strong private consumption growth, especially by urban demand, amid an upturn in exports and robust government investment spending. India will remain a consumption-driven economy (private consumption accounts for about 55% of GDP), even as the share of exports steadily rises. India's merchandise export potential is, however, confined to labour-intensive, low value-added goods, which will drive the sector over the first part of our forecast period (2024-28), in addition to its considerable advantage in services exports. Export promotion schemes from the government, increasing interest in the large and under-explored domestic market, and a desire to branch out operations beyond China have led multinationals to enter partnerships with domestic firms to pursue export-related manufacturing. A few areas where exports will continue to make significant headway include pharmaceuticals, finished electronic goods, engineering goods, chemicals and refined petroleum products. India's import dependence for key items like petroleum, gold, coal, machinery and electronic components will persist over our forecast period, as India firms try to build capabilities in these areas, but progress is slow owing to bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of cost competitiveness.
Agriculture will face climate stresses amid slow growth in productivity We expect agriculture, which is a major rural occupation, to gradually become less important in contributing to growth as the Indian economy moves up the value chain and productivity improves. However, the primary sector will continue to employ nearly half of the population, and it will still account for more than 14% GDP by the end of the forecast period in 2027/28. Agricultural productivity will remain low because of a lack of irrigation development (around half of arable land is irrigated in India), which will prolong the dependence on monsoon rainfall. Income from agriculture will remain meagre, as subsistence farming will continue to be predominant. According to the 2015/16 agricultural census, marginal farmers (those who own less than 1ha of farm land) account for 68.5% of all Indian farmers, although they own only 24% of crop area. Adverse weather conditions and the resultant income loss have forced marginal farmers to increase engagement with other part-time occupations, depend more on animal husbandry, migrate outside villages and apply to the government's rural job guarantee programme. These trends are likely to continue. The government's crop insurance scheme has a fairly good uptake, having the third-largest insurance premiums globally. However, capital investment into agriculture will remain inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of short-term grants and subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers, who form an important vote bank. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, which was set up in 2020, has sanctioned projects including warehouses, primary processing units, custom hiring centres, sorting and grading units, cold store projects, and other kinds of post-harvest management projects and community farming assets. Although climate-adaptive farming options exist, their dissemination and implementation is inadequate. More heat-resistant crop varieties will be slowly developed and introduced.
The industrial sector will be supported by incentives for manufacturing The industrial sector will expand robustly, as the business environment improves and the country's strong economic growth outlook attracts investment. Most opportunities are to be found in downstream activities, owing to the low labour costs. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes form the bedrock of the government's plans to convert India into a global manufacturing hub, and are operational in several sectors of the economy, including high value-added manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors, large-scale electronics, pharmaceutical ingredients, drone development and specialty steel. So far, the scheme has been doing well in sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, telecommunication equipment, food processing and white goods. The government will expand the PLI ambit to cover more sectors, including chemicals and petrochemicals and shipping-grade containers. Other manufacturing sectors that will have increased financial and policy support for indigenisation include defence, commercial aircrafts and railways. Manufacture in advanced areas like semiconductors will take off in the 2030s. Policy continuity will also bolster confidence in foreign investor sentiment. However, the significantly lower majority of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will affect its ability to carry out reforms in select areas. Large-scale business-oriented reforms will face legislative obstructions. In this context, India's aim to compete with South-east Asian nations for "China+1" investment faces a moderate setback, even while growth and demographics will remain eminently favourable. India's absence from trade blocs and high levels of bureaucratic red tape will impede streamlined export productivity. The share of industry in total GDP will average 31% over 2023/24 to 2027/28.
Services will remain the chief growth engine with technology upgrades The services sector will account for about 57% of GDP on average in 2024/25 to 2027/28, remaining the primary engine of economic expansion. The combination of a young, tech-savvy population, a supportive regulatory environment, and continuous innovation will accelerate progress in services. The sector is particularly resilient to external shocks, as displayed during the pandemic, as it is largely domestic-driven. According to the Global Trade Outlook and Statistics report, India maintains a dominant presence in global services exports, and accounted for 6% of global services exports in 2023, compared with 4.4% in 2019. Its expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, financial services, banking, insurance, hospitality, travel, recreation, domestic trade and telecommunications as well as by services in numerous high potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, biotechnology and education. In 2023 there was a notable surge in interest from global private equity (PE) firms and PE-backed entities in acquiring Indian information technology (IT) and software services companies. Indian IT firms will continue trading at a premium to their global counterparts owing to their growth performance and potential. Within IT services, the demand for digital transformation, cloud services, and data analytics will continue to surge. India has the advantage of producing a large number of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates annually, creating a sizeable working population of young English-speaking workers. The greater use of artificial intelligence and machine learning poses moderate medium-term challenges to services job creation.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Consumer prices 5.7 4.7 4.3 4.4 4.2 4.1

Real wages 2.8 3.3 3.7 3.4 3.4 3.4
Unit labour costs (US$) -1.7 1.9 2.8 3.3 3.5 3.2
We forecast that consumer price inflation will decelerate to 4.7% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025 as global commodity prices and domestic demand moderate. Food prices will pose an upside risk to our expected inflation trajectory in the latter half of 2024, because of the possibility of uneven monsoon rainfall. However, overall monsoon rainfall is expected to be above normal, which would bode well for the output of kharif crops that will enter market towards the end of the third quarter. The arrival of fresh crops will help to ease food price pressures by late 2024. The reduction of duties on inbound wheat shipments will help to boost domestic supplies later in the year. Higher freight costs and longer transit times, due to disruption in the Red Sea, will also push up import prices.
Wage inflation will remain modest in the agricultural and industrial sectors owing to excess labour supply, although wages for high-end services will rise moderately. Improvements in logistics infrastructure should boost supply-chain efficiency, reducing supply-driven price pressures.

Policy uncertainty after the election and the anticipation of "higher for longer" interest rates in the US (we expect monetary easing to start only in September 2024) will keep the rupee under depreciatory pressure through the remainder of the year. The value of the rupee will be supported by the RBI's continued interventions in the currency markets, via India's deep foreign-exchange reserves. The inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices from 2024 will also provide some currency stability. We forecast that the rupee will weaken to around Rs85:US$1 by end-2024 and around Rs87:US$1 by end-2025, from Rs83.1:US$1 at end-2023.
Strong growth prospects and easing inflation will provide strength to the rupee in 2025-28. However, a narrow but persistent current-account deficit, alongside moderating capital inflows on fears of policy deadlock, will keep the currency on a mild depreciatory trajectory over that period. India will focus on setting up bilateral trade settlements using the currency, to reduce dependence on trade in the US dollar and the euro. These efforts will progress more meaningfully in 2026-28, which will strengthen the rupee. A sufficient corpus of foreign-exchange reserves will imply limited volatility in exchange rates.

We expect the current-account deficit to narrow to 0.5% of GDP in 2024, from 0.8% of GDP in 2023. This will be driven by a rebound in exports in emerging sectors like electronics, driven by strong consumer demand from major markets such as the US, as well as traditional product categories like pharmaceuticals. However, increased depreciatory pressure on the rupee will raise the cost of imports. The robust surplus on the services account and high remittance inflows will prevent a further widening of the overall deficit.
The gradual development of India's manufacturing capacity supports the export outlook for 2025-28. The inclusion of government bonds in global indices and a robust growth outlook will support portfolio inflows in the medium term, while infrastructure and logistics improvements, aimed at attracting regional supply chains, will benefit foreign direct investment flows.
The government will focus on sealing bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs). Imports not covered under FTAs will continue to face high average tariffs, as the government will incentivise import substitution in sectors such as chemicals, automotive components and agro-based items.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India Stocks and flows India's large market and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Overseas capital inflows into the country contracted by about 3.5% in 2023 owing to global uncertainty amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Europe, as well as tight liquidity conditions. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have nonetheless been strong, totalling US$237bn in 2019-23, which formed 86% of inflows into South Asia. India was ranked as the eighth-largest recipient of FDI in 2023, the third-highest recipient of FDI in greenfield projects and the second-highest recipient of FDI in international project finance deals, according to the UNCTAD World Investment Report 2023. Total FDI inflows to India over 2019-23 have outstripped global peers like Mexico (US$187bn), Indonesia (US$111bn), Vietnam (US$84bn), Malaysia (US$49bn), the Philippines (US$40bn) and Thailand (US$28bn) by a large margin, but they have significantly undershot FDI flows to China (US$824bn). Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$537bn in 2023, compared with US$386bn in 2018.
Origin and distribution In 2023/24 (April-March) FDI inflows to India decreased from major countries, including Mauritius, Singapore, the US, the UK, the UAE, Cayman Islands, Germany and Cyprus. However, investments increased from the Netherlands and Japan. India received the highest FDI from Singapore in 2023/24, according to the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). The largest source of FDI has historically been Mauritius, which accounted for 25% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2024. (Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons.) With a similar tax treaty and some of the lowest rates of taxation in Asia, Singapore is in second place; the city state accounted for 24% of cumulative inflows in 2000-24. It was followed by the US (10%), the Netherlands (7%), Japan (6%) and the UK (5%). More recently, FDI inflows from Singapore and the US have significantly surpassed flows from Mauritius, amid improving interest in India. The US was the third-largest investor in India in 2023/24 (US$5bn), followed by the Netherlands (US$4.9bn), Japan (US$3.2bn), the UAE (US$2.9bn) and the UK (US$1.2bn).
Sectorally, in 2023/24 inflows contracted for services, computer software and hardware, trading, telecommunication, automobile, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, while inflows into construction and electricity sectors rose. Traditionally, the most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$109bn between April 2000 and March 2024, and accounted for 16% of cumulative inflows, according to the DPIIT. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient (15% of cumulative flows), attracting US$103bn in the same period. The Indian state of Maharashtra (which boasts the country's financial centre, Mumbai) attracts most FDI, garnering 30% of the total between October 2019 and March 2024, followed by Karnataka (22%) and Gujarat (17%) in the same period. Gujarat registered an increase of 55% in FDI inflows in 2023/24. Cluster-based industrial regions such as GIFT City, Sanand GIDC, Dholera SIR (Special Investment Region), and Mandal Bechraji SIR also played a significant role in attracting investors. Marquee projects, such as multiple semiconductor manufacturing plants, have also been instrumental in attracting foreign investment to the state.
Determinants India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since taking office, the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, insurance and single-brand retailing. It also provides a product-linked incentive that offers financial compensation for direct investments in emerging sectors such as electronics. India's recent initiatives, such as amendments by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) Regulations 2014, have created new opportunities for Singapore-based investors. The current administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed. Although structural reforms will make headway, difficulty in acquiring land, restrictive rules on local sourcing and existing high leverage on Indian companies' balance sheets will create difficulties. Rules related to the hiring and firing of employees have loosened considerably, but disparities exist among states, with western and southern states having more flexible rules. The slow legal system also acts as a deterrent to the inflow of investment and hampers the ease of business in India for foreigners.
Impact The sectoral distribution of FDI into India has changed significantly over time. Although the share of services in FDI has fallen from 17% in 2014/15-2016/17 to 15% in 2021/22-2023/24, the shares of the computer software and hardware sector (from 10% to 21%), and infrastructure (from 1% to 6%), have risen. FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Although call centres and other forms of back-office administration have been important industries, India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, automobile, telecommunications and construction sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The online retail sector has gained importance over the pandemic, with US-based Amazon and Walmart (through its Flipkart subsidiary) having a significant presence in the e-commerce sector. Many online start-ups have been able to attract attention from venture capitalists and internet giants in the West. However, in offline retail, a significant relaxation of regulations for multibrand retailers is unlikely to occur in 2024-28. The production-linked incentive will spur investment in the electronics sector. In April 2021 to March 2024, only 5% of FDI that India received was in the renewable energy sector, but this will be an increasingly competitive and lucrative area for FDI in India, as the country seeks to transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.
Potential Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI. In 2021 foreign nationals were permitted to invest up to 20% in the Life Insurance Corporation of India, India's largest public-sector insurance company. In 2022-23 the government divested its stakes in several other public sector companies, including Hindustan Aeronautics, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Paradeep Phosphates. Further divestment from similar companies is expected to follow. The government is likely to review foreign direct investment (FDI) caps for critical sectors like defence, insurance, and plantations, examining processes that could be streamlined for a more efficient investment regime. Currently, up to 74% of total FDI is permitted under the automatic route (without government approval) in defence manufacturing, with various conditions including the requirement of industrial licensing for certain sectors and small arms production, which might be subject to review. In the insurance sector, which was opened to overseas players 25 years ago, foreign ownership in general or life insurance companies is capped at 74%, with 100% FDI permissible in insurance intermediaries. The review follows an increase in competition in this sector, with the majority of life insurance companies now showing profitability. In plantations, obtaining approval for insurance may face challenges. Currently, 100% FDI is allowed in tea, coffee, rubber, and several other segments. Given the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's prior protests against increased caps in this sector when it was in the opposition, the current opposition is likely to resist any legislative changes, especially contentious ones. The government is in the process of relaxing FDI regulations in the space sector, with reports suggesting that up to 100% foreign ownership of space-related corporations may be permitted. The potential for even stronger inflows is reduced by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors will be important areas for FDI in 2024-28. Biotechnology, electronics and vehicle manufacturing (including parts) could also attract significant interest amid government support.

A youthful demographic will be India's key competitive advantage EIU forecasts that the population growth will remain slightly below 1% per year in 2024-28, as improving living standards, faster urbanisation and better career opportunities for women reduce fertility rates. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2019-21, India's overall fertility rate has fallen to two per woman, lower than the replacement rate of 2.1-a level that is usually viewed as sufficient to replace a whole generation or keep the population from declining without immigration. As at early 2024, 31 out of 36 states in India have a fertility rate lower than 2.1. Exceptions include poor and populous states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya and Manipur, where populations will continue to grow strongly. This asymmetry will create imbalances among regions and different sections of the population, exerting further pressure on the already sub-par levels of infrastructure in these states. India is still, however, relatively young, with a median age of 28.4 years, compared with 38.4 years in China.
Men will continue to outnumber women in the population over the forecast period. Research from the National Family Health Survey shows that the gender ratio of newborns is 929 girls per 1,000 boys for the country as a whole, showing that gender selection is skewed towards males in most parts of the country because of a traditional preference for male children. The disproportionate gender ratio also spills over to educational attainment and workforce contribution, as these are more available to men than women. Government policies aimed at improving women's education and employment have seen uneven uptake in rural belts, which remain conservative and prioritise males. We expect this disparity to wane with increased education among women. However, the proportion of women in the workforce is expected to remain low, as concerns such as house work, caregiving, safety and low wages compared to their male counterparts persist. World Bank calculations suggest that over the next 10 years, India can add 1.2 percentage points per year to potential growth if female labour-force participation gradually increases from the current 31.6% to more than 50%.
Low wages will support development of manufacturing sectors Growth in the working-age population will remain strong in 2024-28, and this will preserve India's appeal in terms of labour supply. We forecast that India's working-age population will expand by almost 100m in the period to 2030, pushing it comfortably past 1bn, while that of China will fall by 40m to under 950m. However, unlocking the economic benefits of population growth will prove challenging, as India's manufacturing sector is yet to mature. Robust growth in the working-age population, coupled with a misalignment of job market supply and demand, risks straining economic growth prospects in the medium term. Although the manufacturing sector is set to grow, the wider application of industrial automation is likely to hamper job creation. The workforce moving out of agriculture will be increasingly absorbed in services. With minimum-wage norms not being prevalent across industries, the cost of labour, particularly for low-end manufacturing, is likely to remain modest.
Gender-based and regional imbalance in literacy will persist Low levels of literacy and technical skills will persist for a large section of the population. Although enrolment rates in primary education are high, educational outcomes remain sub-par in state-funded schools owing to underqualified teachers, the caste system and bad infrastructure. Secondary educational levels are still inadequate in India, giving rise to skill gaps. The average duration of schooling in India is only 6.5 years; this compares with 8.3 years in Vietnam and 8.9 years in Thailand. The government's training programmes will improve the quality of available workers, but these efforts will take time to filter through into outcomes. Meanwhile these conditions will mean higher training costs for companies engaging the workforce.
UN estimates show that only 35% of the Indian population lived in urban areas in 2021, which was lower than many regional peers such as Vietnam (38%), the Philippines (47%), Thailand (52%) and Indonesia (57%). According to the UN, India's urban population is estimated to stand at 675m in 2035, the second highest behind China's 1bn, while the urbanisation rate will be 43%. The government will focus on building the necessary infrastructure for creating liveable, climate-resilient, and inclusive cities, but this will not keep pace with the rate of urbanisation. Consequently, despite significant public spending, the mismatch between urbanisation and infrastructure will hinder productivity. More than 160 Indian cities have been classified as investment grade, although central and state governments will finance 70% of urban infrastructure.

India became the most populous country globally in 2023, and its sizeable youth population and expanding middle class will underscore growing consumer potential. India's personal disposable income will continue to rise steadily over 2024-28. India's greatest strength lies in the significant market size provided by its huge population, which generates increasing demand for consumer goods, both low-end and premium ones, as incomes rise. The rapid growth in personal incomes combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies seeking to capture this market. Even as household consumption expenditure rises, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain low owing to a large population size.
Substantial income disparity, which has become more entrenched since the covid-19 pandemic, as well as different consumption patterns between rural and urban regions will persist. Rural regions, which house over half of the population, will continue to spend more on food and essential items. Discretionary consumption will rise in urban areas, given a growing aspirational middle-class and a desire to purchase premium products and services. The emergence of suburban spaces, which are transitional areas between rural and urban habitats and have developed around cities owing to rapid urbanisation, will offer an opportunity to tap into a consumer base that has both rural and urban characteristics.
A growing middle class will expand market opportunities in India Digitally influenced sales will continue to grow fast. Opportunities for e-commerce will proliferate with the growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Retail purchases will grow at an accelerated pace in metropolitan and top-tier cities, which will be significantly richer than other cities by the end of this decade. Lower-tier cities and rural areas will remain largely untapped markets, although even these will see significant e-commerce growth by 2028. As internet and logistics availability rises, e-commerce will claim more of the country's consumer market, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms, who are positioning themselves to take advantage of this trend. Compared to China and the US, there is significant headroom for e-retail penetration in India to rise across multiple product categories including electronics, fashion, furniture and grocery. In terms of e-commerce regulation, the BJP government will gradually address concerns like taxes on e-commerce firms, ownership of customer data and the sale of private-label products, and provisions related to advertising-based search results, which will support the sector over 2024-28.

Urbanisation will be a major driver of consumer spending in India. Urban consumers tend to be more aspirational, quality-conscious, convenience-seeking, and digitally savvy than rural consumers. They also have more diverse tastes for health and wellness, sustainability, personalisation and social responsibility. Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty, especially to high-end brands, than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians, price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address affordability by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice serves as a way to develop brand loyalty among new consumers.
Greater penetration of digital services will support consumer demand Omni-channel consumer brands will succeed more as information asymmetry reduces. Several factors will contribute to the strong premiumisation trend, including higher disposable income and easy access to lending and repayment through instalments. The credit boom will drive strength in luxury real estate, automotives and high-end consumer goods. Travel and entertainment will also increasingly gain ground. Premiumisation in smaller towns will be driven by fashion, packaged foods, cosmetics, restaurants and lifestyle accessories.

Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state-directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reform and market liberalisation. Since then, India's GDP has expanded rapidly. However, India's share of world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains low, at about 3% in 2023, compared with its 18% share of the world's population. This highlights significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for low incomes. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries such as information technology (IT) is vast. Transfers of power are clearly established under democratic protocols. India's courts have long suffered from understaffing, and a case backlog has built up over decades; the judiciary remains largely independent.
Jobs will not expand at the same rate as addition to the labour force Demographic trends: India's population growth will continue to decelerate over the next two decades, but the demand in India's labour market will be sufficiently met as the issue of underemployment is addressed gradually and educational attainment improves. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will still not find employment in productive formal-sector jobs. A mismatch between the skill level of the country's workers and the demand for highly educated staff from employers will persist for at least the next two decades, as the quality of education provided by the government (on which a large portion of the population depends) and vocational training systems remain underdeveloped. Meanwhile, the rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will dampen employment gains, even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of global manufacturing. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove difficult in this environment. Still, opportunities for better-educated Indians will proliferate amid rapid growth in professional services, manufacturing and high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharmaceuticals. After a period of stabilisation, the pivot to a falling working-age population will not occur before 2050. Divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. Slowing population growth will gradually alleviate pressure on scarce resources over the next two decades. Meanwhile, workers will continue to look abroad for economic opportunities, with lower-skilled workers preferring the Gulf region, while skilled workers will migrate to the US (however, visa norms will get tighter) and Canada. As a consequence, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
India will foster friendly bilateral relations except with China and Pakistan External conditions: As the fifth-largest economy globally, and given its high growth rates, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and to strengthen ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival, and China, with which India shares a border dispute. EIU expects India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences. However, India's GDP and military might far outstrips Pakistan's, which means that Pakistan will refrain from initiating overt conflict, and continue to resort to terrorism attacks against India, which will provoke a strong covert or overt military response from India. China's presence in South Asia (especially in Pakistan) will push India towards adopting a more defensive posture to shield its domestic market from China, for instance, maintaining restrictions on Chinese-origin foreign direct investment, while also upping its defence infrastructure and arsenal along shared borders. Shared strategic and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific will bind India more closely to the members of the Quad (an informal diplomatic grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India). We do not believe that India will formally align itself with the US; it will retain a degree of independence in foreign policy to allow manoeuvring space for its domestic considerations. The importance of China-inclusive blocs like the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) will gradually wane in India's international agenda. Even as it engages more with the West, India will balance its traditionally strong relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment, and in recent years, crude oil, but the relationship will weaken, though not sour, over time. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement in these regions. India will share strong bilateral strategic and economic relations with most nations.
Some reforms will progress slower than others due to coalition politics Institutions and policy trends: Even as political power remains centralised in the 2020s, regional parties will emerge as dominant players in propping up national coalitions, giving them a say in the regional and national policy space. Growth will accelerate in reform-minded states, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to balance economic disparities. India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will remain impartial (but slow) and the constitution will be respected. Business reforms related to land and labour will progress slowly, and may hit intermittent roadblocks. India's integration into regional and global value chains will nonetheless be constrained by a lingering tendency towards protectionism. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft.
Gradual diversification of supply chains beyond China will help Indian growth Long-term performance: India's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment. Improvements in the adoption of technology and greater supply-chain efficiency in the agricultural sector will make rural India more resilient to climate change. However, the shift of the workforce from rural labour into more productive urban jobs will remain the leading driver of India's economic expansion. Many companies have become wary of supply-chain overreliance on China and India is increasingly well-placed to capitalise on these trends. In the long term India is the only single market that offers a potential scale comparable to that of China. Intrinsic capabilities including solid economic fundamentals, a sound digital infrastructure and favourable demographics will encourage major manufacturing investment. A gradual improvement in the quality of education and vocational training will also lay the groundwork for the development of the higher-value-added sectors that will be necessary to sustain the country's growth momentum in the longer term. India's reluctance to sign multilateral trade deals will remain a major competitive disadvantage. We forecast that real GDP growth will average 5.4% annually over 2024-50, maintaining India's status as one of the strongest-growing emerging markets. Inflation will moderate gradually as capacity and logistics improve. Greater capital intensity and technological adoption will strengthen growth, but we believe that the economy will still fall short of its potential because of inadequate employment opportunities and slow adaptation to climate change.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability India is one of the countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change. The Climate Action Tracker, a body which tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris Agreement, judges India's current performance as highly insufficient, but current policies will help India to overachieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets by 2030. Securing the required finance to manage the effects of climate change will remain the largest impediment, since it could cost India more than Rs85trn (US$1.1trn) by 2030 alone, with further financing requirements in the years ahead. India is the world's third-largest carbon emitter, though per-head emissions are very small compared to many other nations. In November 2021 the prime minister, Narendra Modi, set a target for India to become a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2070. India's energy demand will continue to grow, making it difficult to move away completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. India will continue to direct coal and gas-fired power plants to operate at peak capacity to meet the rise in seasonal electricity demand brought on by record-hot summers. Even as there is no plan for building additional coal capacity beyond what is under development until 2026-27, the latest electricity plan includes adding substantial new coal power capacity in the following five years, and the government is pushing for increased domestic coal production. Additionally, transitioning away from a coal-based economy will be very gradual, given the sheer numbers dependent on the coal economy as a source of livelihood. Under the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, India has made continuous strides in bolstering its renewable energy credentials. This includes the National Hydrogen Mission that was launched in 2021 (which aims to make India a green hydrogen hub), a gradual increase in the minimum renewable purchase obligation for the power distribution companies, and a nationwide charging network for electric vehicles (which is under way). India also aims to expand its nuclear power capacity by at least threefold in the next decade. The government has started auctions under a production-linked incentive programme for electrolyser manufacturing for green hydrogen production. India has made constant strides in increasing its renewable energy capacity, and ambitious plans are outlined in the National Electricity Plan 2023 (NEP2023), with its share within total capacity targeted at 66% by 2031-32. The installed renewable energy capacity has risen to 203.2 GW in June 2024, from 119.5-GW in December 2018. The NEP2023 also provides guidance to facilitate the procurement and utilisation of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS).
Technological developments Leveraging a large pool of skilled professionals, India has long been a global information technology (IT) outsourcing hub. Although India boasts a culture of innovation, gross expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant at about 0.7% for about a decade, and is lower than peers like Brazil (1.2%) and South Africa (0.8%). India's strides in services exports, which swelled from US$201bn in 2018 to US$338bn in 2023, has been led by IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) services. India has developed about 1,600 Global Capability Centres (GCCs), where companies can outsource their product development and receive product engineering services. In the science and technology sector, India has active bilateral programmes of cooperation with countries in Africa, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, BRICS and the EU. In 2021 India entered into a five-year plan with Denmark to implement a green strategic partnership for science and technology, while in 2022 iy entered into the US-India iCET (Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies) agreement to strengthen their collaboration in new technology. The areas of focus involve the quantum co-ordination mechanism, as well as discussions on telecommunications and exchanges on AI and space. India became a signatory to the US-led Artemis Accords in 2023, which ensures India's access to cutting-edge spacecraft and exploration technology. In the years ahead, India is launching an AI mission to provide start-ups and innovators with more computing power to help them tackle problems in areas like healthcare, agriculture and education. The India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), started in 2023, aims to create a semiconductor and display ecosystem to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design. The start of construction on Micron's US$2.75bn semiconductor plant, as well as the agreement between India's Tata Electronics and Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) to establish India's first semiconductor fabrication unit (both in Gujarat), have been milestones in this regard. Nanotechnology is likely to transform India's pharmaceutical industry, while the agriculture sector is also undergoing a major revamp, with the government investing heavily in a technology-driven green revolution.
Migration and urbanisation India will continue to experience an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities for better-paid jobs. Social policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will increasingly have to tilt towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, inadequate urban infrastructure and declining sustainability in urban centres. The construction of urban mass-transit systems will increase, along with other urban infrastructure such as roads, sanitation and power grids. However, the enormous scale of these challenges will temper the pace of progress. The biggest challenge for policymakers will be training the workforce of rural migrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agriculture sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) was narrowly elected president in 2022. The liberal Minjoo Party subsequently strengthened its dominance in the National Assembly (parliament) after winning a landslide in the legislative election in 2024. Political polarisation will hinder policymaking, and the government will also be encumbered by labour strikes and public protests over social and economic issues.
- Inter-Korean relations will remain fraught, amid a persistent military threat from the North, given both the hawkish stance of Yoon Suk-yeol's government and the continued development and testing of strategic weapons by North Korea. South Korea will deepen co-operation with the US on defence, technology and supply-chain security. This will risk fraying South Korea's ties with China, its largest trading partner; South Korea will seek to mitigate this by accelerating the diversification of its supply chains into South-east Asia.
- The focus of fiscal policy will shift towards consolidation, as the PPP government seeks to narrow the deficit on its fiscal account. This effort will be obstructed by slow growth in tax revenue, however. Increasing fiscal outlays on tax support, alongside a large defence budget and subsidies for strategic industries and child-bearing, will complicate this further.
- The Bank of Korea (BOK, South Korea's central bank) will keep its policy rate at 3.5% until October 2024, when it will embark on a gradual easing cycle to support economic growth, employment and export competitiveness. The slower pace of monetary easing relative to the US will facilitate appreciation of the currency, the won, against the US dollar in 2025.
- Real GDP growth will accelerate marginally to 2.7% in 2025, from 2.6% in 2024, as external demand surges amid an upturn in global electronics demand, particularly for memory chips, and frontloaded orders in the US in anticipation of higher US tariffs from mid-2025. Domestic private consumption will also pick up in 2025 as a result of easing inflation and lower borrowing costs. Without a significant rebalancing away from exports, the economy will remain vulnerable to shifts in global trade. The export sector will need to boost innovation to mitigate the impact of regional trade disruption and manufacturing competition.
- The current account will remain in the black, despite a large import bill swollen by high global commodity costs; this will support a moderate appreciation of the won against the US dollar in 2024-25.

- South Korea's business environment will improve in 2024-28, leading to a rise in its ranking both regionally and globally. Steady progress will be driven by policies that are friendly to private enterprise and foreign trade.

Country forecast overview: South Korea's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The government promotes the corporate "value up" initiative to make South Korean companies more attractive to domestic and foreign investors by eliminating the "Korea discount" on the valuation of publicly traded local firms.
2026-28: The government proposes new legislation and policies aimed at increasing competition in the services sector.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: With a focus on strategic sectors such as semiconductors and digital technology, the government increases policy engagement with foreign technology companies to strengthen international supply-chain co-operation.
2026-28: The government relaxes restrictions on investment by private foreign companies in sectors such as broadcasting, telecommunications and aviation, to increase competition and break oligopolistic control.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Participation in the US-led realignment of the global supply chain deepens, reducing trade reliance on China.
2026-28: Higher tariffs in the US will undermine the profitability of South Korean export companies.
Taxes 2024-25: International taxation reform introducing a global minimum tax of 15% comes into effect, complicating tax consequences for global companies, both South Korean and foreign, that operate across different tax jurisdictions.
2026-28: The corporate tax cut debate gains renewed momentum towards the presidential election year of 2027.
Financing 2024-25: The digitalisation of financial services accelerates, with participation from the growing fintech industry.
2026-28: Large South Korean commercial banks face political pressure to reduce their earnings dependence on oligopolistic interest income, with policymakers seeking to infuse increased competition into the banking sector.
The labour market 2024-25: The conservative-led government's deregulatory labour reform initiatives are bogged down in parliament.
2026-28: Growth in labour costs in South Korea continues to outpace that of peer countries, owing to a shrinking working-age population, low immigration and active labour unions.
Infrastructure 2024-25: The role of nuclear power in the energy mix increases to meet electricity demand and to keep energy costs low.
2026-28: The increasing impact of climate change on the economy and quality of life creates pressure to reduce environmental costs and enhance the sustainability of infrastructure development.
Technological readiness 2024-25: The development of fintech and the digital economy ecosystem makes progress, with growing participation of start-ups and global technology companies.
2026-28: Investment in research and development relating to 6G telecommunications technology goes into full swing.

a Actual. b EIU estimates.
Background: Korea was subjected to colonial rule by Japan from 1910 to 1945, and then to partition by the US and the Soviet Union in 1945. The subsequent war between the two Koreas in 1950-53 cost 4m lives, but neither side won. Summits between South Korea and North Korea were held in 2000 and 2007. Regular contact subsequently led to a cautious thaw in relations, despite the North's nuclear programme. A former president, Moon Jae-in, spearheaded international efforts to engage with the North, leading to three summits with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, in 2018. However, diplomatic and economic engagement stalled in 2019, as the North preferred direct (but, to date, fruitless) talks with the US.
Political structure: Following several decades of authoritarian rule, South Korea has been a democracy since the 1990s. A directly elected president, who serves a single five-year term, appoints the prime minister and cabinet. A unicameral National Assembly (parliament) is elected every four years. Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) succeeded Moon Jae-in, of the liberal Minjoo Party, as president in May 2022. However, Minjoo dominates the National Assembly, having expanded its representation in the 300-seat parliament to 175 after the election in April 2024.
Policy issues: Yoon Suk-yeol's government will focus on using deregulation and tax cuts to increase labour-market flexibility, reduce tax and regulatory burdens for businesses and the self-employed, and encourage investment and research and development in strategic industries. However, plans for tax reduction and deregulation are likely to be thwarted in parliament, owing to the ruling party's significant numerical disadvantage. The authorities will also employ policy and tax incentives to facilitate investment in advanced technologies and digital infrastructure, with the aim of promoting competitiveness and independence in manufacturing. Reining in property price growth will be another priority for the government. EIU expects the authorities to increase the supply of affordable housing through public planning and to use tax incentives to increase private-sector housing development.
Taxation: Corporate income tax ranges from 10% to 24%. Companies are subject to a residency surtax applied at a rate of 10% of corporate tax liability. Personal income tax ranges from 8% to 42%. In addition, a residency surcharge of 10% of income-tax liability is applied. The rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 10%.
Foreign trade: Merchandise export revenue decreased to US$645bn in 2023, from US$694.3bn in 2022, while the value of goods imports dropped by 10.7% to US$611bn. The trade surplus widened to US$34bn. Semiconductors account for about 20% of total exports. Shipments of mid-to-high-end memory chips will grow strongly in the forecast period, owing to data centre expansion, the development of artificial intelligence and a recovery in demand for consumer electronic devices.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability South Korea's generally benign political outlook is underpinned by widespread respect for democratic institutions, a low risk of violent social unrest and business-friendly mainstream parties. However, the functioning of government suffers from partisan antagonism. Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), who was narrowly elected as president in 2022, faces an opposition-controlled parliament. The legislative election in April 2024 further exacerbated the split between executive and legislative power, as it increased the opposition parties' dominance in the National Assembly (the unicameral parliament). Policymaking and state budgeting will be frequently frustrated, as the government will have to reach agreement with the main opposition Minjoo Party to pass bills and budgets through parliament.
This situation will severely curb Yoon Suk-yeol's ability to embark on reforms or manage domestic affairs in the remainder of his single-term presidency, which ends in 2027. The space for policy agreement with the opposition party is narrow, probably limited to boosting manufacturing competitiveness and supporting child-rearing. The government's plan to lower the corporate tax burden and deregulate the labour market will be stranded amid conflict with trade unions and fierce opposition in parliament. The stances held by male and female Koreans on various policy issues, including male-only compulsory conscription, will become increasingly polarised.
Neither of the main parties enjoys broad support across the political divide. Continued attacks aimed at inflicting reputational damage will erode public confidence in politicians and derail consensus-building efforts. Scandals related to corruption and the abuse of power will risk undermining the authority of senior officials. The PPP has outlined only modest proposals to tackle rising economic inequality and collusion between government officials and the country's industrial conglomerates (chaebol), despite these being two issues of widespread public concern. This will dampen the party's efforts to broaden public support in the longer term.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch Following the legislative election held in April 2024, Minjoo expanded its representation in the 300-member National Assembly to 175 seats, retaining the power to pass bills unilaterally and holding sway in appointments to most parliamentary policy committees. By contrast, the PPP was reduced to 108 seats, representing the ruling party's smallest parliamentary presence in South Korea's democratic history. Although Minjoo lacks the two-thirds majority that would enable it to negate the president's veto, it can seek co-operation from the new left-leaning Rebuilding Korea Party, which controls 12 seats, to strike down government-proposed bills.
However, the landslide result belies tight competition between the two main parties. In the 254 constituencies decided by first-past-the-post voting, Minjoo won around 50% of the total votes, against 45% for the PPP. Meanwhile, in the 46 seats decided by proportional voting, the PPP-affiliated People Future Party won 18 and Minjoo 14. These results show that popular support for the two parties is much closer than suggested by their parliamentary seat counts, and the country remains divided roughly evenly between the liberal and conservative camps.
This also indicates that the next presidential election, scheduled for 2027, will be an intense contest. Yoon Suk-yeol cannot stand again because of the single-term limit, leaving space for fierce competition to represent the conservatives. Meanwhile, despite leading Minjoo to a historic victory in the legislative election, Lee Jae-myung, the party's chairman and a possible candidate for the presidency, remains a controversial figure, facing police investigation over alleged abuse of power and corruption.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Inter-Korean relations will remain fraught in 2024-28, posing a persistent threat to South Korea's national security. The country will tilt further towards the US in the latter's strategic rivalry with China, but will avoid outright antagonism because of deep and complex economic ties with China and China's strong influence on North Korea.
Yoon Suk-yeol's government will maintain a hardline approach towards North Korea by strengthening South Korea's defence capabilities and enhancing military and economic co-operation with the US. Although South Korea remains open to talks, we believe that North Korea's leadership deems the country to be non-essential in terms of any negotiations over sanctions relief; it will instead focus its efforts on the US.
The upgrade in June 2024 of the relationship between Russia and North Korea, which now contains a mutual defence agreement, has further complicated the situation on the Korean peninsula. Russian military technical assistance will help to improve North Korea's strategic weapons, particularly in the launching and precision of missiles, augmenting its threat to South Korea. This will undermine South Korea's ties with Russia, which have already been strained by the former's participation in international financial and trade sanctions on Russia. South Korea will also be incentivised to enhance its defence capability further, by deepening co-operation with its allies, including the US, Japan and Australia, and increasing domestic weapon production and purchases of US arms.
There is strong public support for South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons or hosting US tactical nuclear weapons on its soil. EIU believes that neither of these options is viable, however, given the risk of upsetting China and/or escalating inter-Korean tensions.
Another Donald Trump presidency in the US, which has now become our baseline assumption, would complicate defence and economic relations between the US and South Korea. Mr Trump would seek to gain advantage in bilateral trade through higher tariffs and the threat to renegotiate a free-trade agreement. However, our baseline forecast is that South Korea would be able to secure partial exemptions, which would reduce disruption. Regardless, co-ordination with the US and its allies on semiconductors and clean-energy supply chains, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries, will increase. South Korean businesses will ultimately be forced to align with US-led trade restrictions on targeted Chinese industries. Firms will respond to these risks by lobbying the US administration to soften its measures, diversifying their supply chains and expanding their manufacturing presence in North America (partly to benefit from US subsidies) and South-east Asia.
These moves will weigh on relations with China, particularly as trade and investment tensions rise. Production and supply-chain diversification will help South Korea to mitigate these anxieties. However, the government will also be wary of antagonising China, its largest trading partner, whose help is also needed to contain the military threat from North Korea.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends The government has an agenda of deregulation and tax cuts to encourage private-sector investment and employment. Tax incentives will be provided for key industries such as microchips, batteries and artificial intelligence (AI), with the aim of raising the competitiveness of advanced manufacturing.
South Korea's ageing population and low fertility rate (the lowest in the world in 2023, at 0.72) mean that labour shortages will be a persistent feature weighing on growth. This will force the government to increase expenditure on health and social care, including childcare. The government will also seek to attract foreign workers with special skills to supplement the local labour supply. However, growth in immigration will be slow because of persistent restrictions and concerns about disruption to local employment and society. Trade unions will strongly oppose efforts to give businesses greater flexibility to increase working hours and lay off staff. This will prepare the ground for increased confrontation with the conservative-led government, which intends to weaken the unions' power and deregulate the labour market to reduce operational costs for businesses.
There is bipartisan support for the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050, although the government will support steady growth in the oil and petrochemical industries in the forecast period, to improve energy security and support exports. Offshore wind power will be the main focus of renewable-energy development. Yoon Suk-yeol's administration will embrace nuclear power as a clean alternative energy source and will promote exports of civilian nuclear technology.
Economic security will rise up the policy agenda. The government will bolster legal and policy support to protect major manufacturing and technology sectors from industrial espionage, intellectual property theft and aggressive talent poaching by foreign companies. This will introduce additional compliance costs for businesses with exposure to these sectors.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy The public finances will remain in deficit throughout 2024-28, but the shortfall will narrow consistently as a percentage of GDP. In addition to social security expenditure, which will demand steady increases owing to demographic ageing, public spending will prioritise incentivising infrastructure upgrade, as well as research-and-development investment in the advanced manufacturing and technology sectors.
The government will maintain fiscal consolidation efforts by replacing large-scale expenditure programmes with targeted subsidies and tax incentives. The state budget for 2024 includes a 2.8% increase in fiscal expenditure to W656.9trn (US$486bn), representing the smallest increase since 2006. A supplementary budget providing cash handouts to alleviate cost-of-living pressure on households is forthcoming, but it will be restricted to low-to-middle-income households, to reduce the impact on the public finances. We forecast a deficit equivalent to 1.6% of GDP in 2024.
Beyond 2024, fiscal support for industrial development will focus on strategic sectors, emphasising the public sector's role in guiding and supporting development in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential for wide application across the whole economy. Subsidies to encourage childbearing and to support export companies in trade financing, supply-chain diversification and the procurement of fuel and critical resources will also feature in public expenditure. Growing pension and healthcare requirements, resulting from a shrinking working-age population, will exert lasting pressure on the public finances. Consequently, we forecast that the fiscal deficit will narrow only slowly to 0.4% of GDP by 2028. Diminishing shortfalls on the fiscal account will help to bring down (gradually) the public debt as a share of GDP in the forecast period. Averaging 51.6% of GDP in 2025-28, debt will remain low in comparison with the OECD average (which exceeded 100% of GDP in 2022), with repayment risks contained by the fact that debt is mainly held domestically.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy We expect the Bank of Korea (BOK, South Korea's central bank) to keep its policy rate at 3.5% until October 2024. By then, subsiding domestic inflation and a shift to monetary easing in the US will allow the BOK to start cutting interest rates in small increments. The return of monetary easing in South Korea will reflect the central bank's concern about slowing economic growth and domestic debt serviceability. A high level of household debt (equivalent to around 100% of GDP) makes South Korea's economy sensitive to interest-rate changes, especially as a large portion of mortgages (the main source of household debt) are subject to floating interest rates.
We expect the BOK to adopt a steady and incremental approach to monetary easing in 2024-26, involving a series of 25-basis-point rate cuts. The policy rate will fall subsequently to 2.5% by 2026 as the central bank shifts its focus to supporting economic growth, employment and export competitiveness. The BOK will keep the policy rate unchanged in 2026, amid stable economic growth and benign inflation.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth We forecast that real GDP growth will accelerate to 2.7% in 2025, from 2.6% in 2024. Economic expansion in these two years will be driven largely by the export sector, as overseas orders surge ahead of the holiday season in late 2024, and again in the first half of 2025, as exports are frontloaded in anticipation of higher tariffs in the US. By contrast, private consumption, although still an important economic driver, will be weighed down throughout 2024 by sustained inflation and high borrowing costs, before receiving a boost in 2025 from improving real household income growth and monetary easing. Gross fixed investment, particularly in machinery and facilities, will be constrained by growing economic uncertainty. The shift to a more cautious fiscal approach will constrain government consumption and slow infrastructure investment.
Economic growth will decelerate in 2026 as exports subside amid growing global trade frictions, before stabilising in 2027-28 amid recovering growth in the external sector and employment. Investment spending will accelerate, led by infrastructure construction and pro-growth policies in the semiconductor, battery, bio-health and AI sectors. However, government consumption in 2024-28 will be more muted in a historical context, as the conservative PPP reins in public spending to reduce the fiscal deficit.
South Korea will remain reliant on its export-led growth model, with particularly strong dependence on external demand for chips, consumer electronics and clean-energy cars. EVs and related products will provide fresh momentum for the domestic automotive and battery sectors, although activity will remain export-reliant, and Chinese rivals that often enjoy cost advantages will offer strong competition for global market share. Electronics exporters will focus on mid-to-high-end semiconductors, as market share for low-end electronic products drifts towards rival Chinese manufacturers. Growing international trade conflicts and China's increasing substitution of domestic products for imported goods also pose challenges to South Korean exporters.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation We forecast that average inflation will decelerate to 2.1% in 2025, from 2.4% in 2024. We expect consumer price inflation to ease towards 2% by the end of 2024 because of suppressed consumer spending. However, persistent pressure on food and energy prices, due to adverse weather conditions and heightened geopolitical tension, and rising wage demands in the services sector will keep consumer price inflation sticky in 2025.
Inflation will subsequently remain moderate, averaging 1.6% in 2026-28, as steady wage growth sustains a stable rise in consumer spending. In the long term, however, inflation will be suppressed by demographic ageing and weakening consumer spending.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates The South Korean won will strengthen against the US dollar in 2025. The Federal Reserve (the US central bank) will launch monetary easing, and the BOK will be unable to match the pace and scale of interest-rate cuts, creating a favourable interest-rate differential trend for the won's appreciation. Meanwhile, the more protective trade policy and growing fiscal deficit in the US will check the pace of monetary easing there, which will in turn support the US dollar and keep a lid on the won's appreciation. We forecast that the won will reach W1,290:US$1 by the end of 2025, compared with W1,339:US$1 at end-2024.
Intensifying geopolitical tension in North-east Asia, particularly relating to the Taiwan Strait and North Korea, will remain a depreciatory factor for the won. Heavily reliant on trade with both China and the US, South Korea would experience severe disruption-leading to a collapse in investor sentiment-in the event of a regional military conflict (which is not our core forecast).
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector Merchandise exports will record robust growth in 2024-25, underpinned by a recovery in global consumer demand for electronics, a restocking cycle, growing orders of memory chips and communication devices and frontloaded US orders ahead of the introduction of higher US tariffs by mid-2025 (assuming that Donald Trump wins the presidential election). That said, components imports will increase in tandem with finished goods exports. Together with still-high prices for imported oil products, this will keep the import bill large. Services exports will continue to increase, owing to a notable rebound in tourism inflows (by the end of 2024 tourism-related exports will have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels). Growth will continue in the country's flourishing creative industries (including film, music and video games). We forecast that the current account will record a surplus equivalent to 3.2% of GDP in 2024 and will average 2.7% of GDP in the remainder of the forecast period.
South Korean manufacturers of semiconductors, vehicles and batteries will accelerate the relocation and diversification of production in 2024-28. This will be driven by cost considerations and by geopolitical pressure to strengthen supply-chain resilience and security. It will also reflect the aim of serving local customers in destination markets better, against the backdrop of increasing trade regionalisation.

Full text: - The president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, will dominate the political landscape with the next presidential election not due until 2028. Mr Marcos will devote much of his years in office to guiding the country's continued economic recovery and restoring close ties with the US (likely to the upset of China). Longer-term policy initiatives include political and consti-tutional reforms on the empowerment of provincial authorities and anti-graft regime. Political jockeying will probably resurface around the mid-term elections in May 2025, although EIU expects political stability to be broadly maintained.

- The Philippines' business environment will improve in 2024-28, on the back of the previous government's major tax reforms and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalisation. Meanwhile, the current administration's push to strengthen and deepen trade links will help; these include the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which took effect last year, and the ongoing talks to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and establish a free-trade agreement with the EU. Although the macroeconomic environment is expected to deteriorate amid a wide current-account deficit and elevated external debt, a young workforce, increased regional integration, and friendlier policies towards businesses will help to improve market opportunities. The main drags on the business environment will be the political environment (which remains plagued by corruption and cronyism) and long-standing infrastructure bottlenecks.

- We expect real GDP to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8% in 2024-28 which would be a touch below its pre-pandemic (2015-19) trend of 6.5%. Growth will be supported by strong domestic demand from household consumption and investment related to the government's infrastructure plans. The budget deficit will narrow only gradually throughout the forecast period, remaining a source of vulnerability. However, stronger exports-particularly on the services side-strong inflows of remittances, and lower imported energy prices, will see the current-account deficit close by the end of the forecast period, lending some stability to the currency.

- We believe that the annual average growth rate in population will slow marginally to 1.4% in 2024-28, from 1.6% in 2019-23. Free contraception has been available since December 2012, after the then government overcame opposition from the Roman Catholic church. However, uptake remains uneven because of the church's paramount influence in much of the Philippines. It is therefore likely that the impact of the government's policy will only be felt in the longer term. Poverty and underemployment are expected to remain high in 2024-28, as the pandemic reversed progress made in prior years in lifting people out of poverty.

- GDP per head will continue to grow in 2024-28, as GDP growth comfortably outpaces population growth. This means that the Philippines will remain on course to qualify as an upper-middle-income country in the latter part of our forecast period. Nevertheless, severe income inequality will remain an issue. Disparity between the richest and poorest households will remain acute. Although the market for discretionary consumer goods will grow in cities, food and utilities will continue to account for the bulk of spending.

- In the absence of fundamental institutional reform, the Philippines is likely to underperform in the long term. Real GDP growth will average 5% per year in 2024-50. The high level of English-language skills will benefit the country. Recent and near future rises in gross fixed investment as a percentage of GDP are likely to boost productivity growth further ahead, although potential will continue to be tempered by institutional obstacles to effective policy implementation, as well as widespread corruption.

Background: The Philippine islands were ruled by Spain from 1565 to 1898, after which the US took control. The islands became independent in 1946. The 21-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos (1965-86) was characterised by economic mismanagement and martial law. A democratic system was re-established under Corazon Aquino (1986-92) and maintained under Fidel Ramos (1992-98) and Joseph Estrada (1998-2001). In 2001 Mr Estrada was removed in a military-backed civilian coup and replaced by his vice-president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who won the presidential election in 2004. Mrs Aquino's son, Benigno Aquino, won the 2010 presidential poll and stepped down in June 2016 after serving a full term, and was replaced by a populist and former mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte. The country held its 17th presidential election in May 2022 and Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr (son of Ferdinand Marcos) was inaugurated as the new president in June 2022.
Political structure: There is a presidential system of government, with the president being limited to a single six-year term. Congress (the legislature) is modelled on the US system and comprises two directly elected bodies, the Senate (the upper house), normally with 24 members, and the House of Representatives (the lower house), with 304 members at present.
Policy issues: Mr Marcos's socioeconomic policy agenda aims to tackle issues of high inflation, food security, improved transport systems, affordable and clean energy, healthcare, education and social services, as well as improving fiscal management and bureaucratic efficiency. Implementing these will remain a challenge, as progress remains slow owing to a lack of legislative support.
Taxation: The corporate income-tax rate stands at 30%, but is expected to fall to 20% by 2029 as part of ongoing tax reform. Personal income-tax rates are structured into five bands, ranging from 5% to 32% of taxable income. Tax-exemption levels for individuals end at P250,000 (about US$4,700).
Foreign trade: The merchandise trade deficit (on a balance-of-payments basis) narrowed to US$52.6bn in 2023, from US$57.6bn in 2022. Exports totalled US$73.6bn in 2023, while imports totalled US$126.2bn. The narrower trade deficit contributed to decrease in the overall current-account deficit to US$11.2bn, or 2.6% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Political forces in the Philippines will remain somewhat divided, leading to difficulty for the government in passing substantive legislation in 2024-28. A feud with the influential former president, Rodrigo Duterte, alongside the continued loose party affiliations of Philippine legislators, are likely to constrain the power of the government in decision-making processes and facilitating concerted legislative action.

The incumbent president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, will continue to enjoy a strong parliamentary majority, support in public-opinion polls, a House of Representatives (the lower house) led by his cousin, and the Senate (the upper house) being led by a key political ally. However, he will face resistance from allies of Mr Duterte. Sara Duterte, the vice-president and Mr Duterte's daughter, resigned from her position as education secretary in June 2024 in a likely move to act as a more forceful opposition to Mr Marcos from outside the government.

The rift between the Marcos and Duterte clans is unlikely to close over the coming years. That is because of the likely continuation of one of its main proximate causes-Mr Marcos's foreign policy shift away from China towards the US and its allies, undoing Mr Duterte's pivot in the opposite direction.

Political outlook: Political stability Mr Marcos continues to enjoy high approval ratings, largely because of his efforts to protect the welfare of overseas Filipino workers; to promote peace and defend national territorial integrity; to provide timely and generous relief to areas hit by natural disasters; and to fight criminality. Despite public support, however, he is facing increasing challenges for the rest of his term. His attempt to reform the military pension programme in 2023 has irked the armed forces. Moreover, his failure to address extrajudicial killings following the declared revival of the "war on drugs" by Sebastian Duterte, the mayor of Davao City and son of the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, will reduce the public support that Mr Marcos has accumulated through populist policies. Concerns regarding inflation and a fall in foreign direct investment (particularly from China, because of tensions in the South China Sea) have further affected the country's economic performance, potentially weighing on Mr Marcos's popularity.
Tensions within the ruling coalition between the camps of Mr Marcos and his predecessor pose a bigger threat to political stability than the formal political opposition. With the former president's daughter serving as the current vice-president, Mr Marcos has generally emphasised continuity with Mr Duterte's policies. However, he had made efforts to open up policy changes. His focus on the restoration of traditional ties with the US (Mr Duterte moved closer to China) and steps to soften his predecessor's controversial anti-drug campaign are flashpoints. Tensions between the two camps will hamper some governmental functioning.
Mr Marcos's administration will be sensitive to risks tied to economic conditions. EIU expects the administration to make cash handouts to poor families and to subsidise the cost of essential goods, primarily to preserve its public opinion ratings.
The political and security situation in the Bangsamoro region of the southern island of Mindanao is improving but will remain delicate, especially after recent terrorist attacks in Marawi and Mr Duterte's rhetoric about supporting the island's secession from the Philippines. The establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2019 was an important step forward in a peace process designed to end decades of armed conflict between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government. With Bangsamoro due to elect its own parliament in 2025, thus concluding the transition to autonomy, efforts at stabilisation will remain crucial. The disarmament of private militias and delivery of socioeconomic packages to ex-combatants remain issues that could derail the process.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Reform of political system is unlikely to be among the domestic priorities of the president, Mr Marcos. Previous calls for moving towards a more federal system and away from a Manila-centric model, including by then-president Mr Duterte, have not resulted in any tangible changes. Considering Mr Marcos's political background and public statements favouring a more powerful central government, he is unlikely to make any serious push for such fundamental political reform as his government focuses on guiding the country back to steady economic growth and upgrading infrastructure.
For decades after the country's independence, the realisation of policy-from the enactment of laws in Congress to their implementation-depended on the interplay of patronage networks around local powerbrokers, bonds of family and friendship, and semi-feudal socioeconomic relationships. Corruption and red tape are deeply rooted and pervasive, often distorting policy formation and implementation. These dynamics are unlikely to change in 2024-2028.
Mr Marcos hails from an established northern political dynasty like many of his predecessors, which means he has maintained deep ties with the powerful vested interests in blocking the changes to institutions that are needed to root out the enduring customs of graft and nepotism in the longer term. Political dynasties continue to play a critical role in Philippine politics and society, evident in the landslide election victory of Mr Marcos as president despite his relative lack of political experience and achievements. The election of Ms Duterte as vice-president also points to the emergence of yet another political dynasty. The Anti-Political Dynasty Bill has been pending in Congress since it was put forward in 2011. Previous attempts to tackle the prevalence of political families have failed to get off the ground (two-thirds of current members of Congress and many more local politicians hail from such dynasties). Prospects for change remain remote.
Political outlook: Election watch The next major nationwide election is due in 2025, in the middle of the six-year presidential term, when half of the Senate (the upper house of Congress, or parliament) and the whole House of Representatives (the lower house) will be elected. Our core forecast remains that the incumbent administration led by Mr Marcos will retain power.
Midterm elections often serve as de facto referendums on the performance of the president. They also guide the strategies of the country's prominent political camps ahead of the next presidential election. The president's allies are well placed to maintain their majorities in 2025 because of fluidity in party alignment.
Political outlook: International relations Bilateral relations between the Philippines and the US will strengthen under Mr Marcos. The US has long been the country's primary security partner and its biggest cultural influence, but was sidelined during 2016-22 by the Duterte administration, which sought closer ties with China. The countries expanded their Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement in 2023 under Mr Marcos, increasing the number of Philippine military bases that the US can access from five to nine. Most of these bases are in the north of the country, suggesting a greater presence close to Taiwan that would enable the US to counter any possible Chinese action against the island. In return, the US president, Joe Biden, offered the Philippines an "ironclad" security guarantee. Heightened geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea will also prompt the Philippines to upgrade its security ties with other US-aligned countries, such as Australia and Japan.
The outlook for relations with China remains problematic. Despite Mr Duterte's attempt to form an alliance, territorial disputes with China and that country's persistent naval activity in the South China caused embarrassment to his administration. Two visits by Mr Marcos to the Chinese capital, Beijing, in 2023 demonstrated his intention to keep bilateral relations stable, despite his US-leaning stance. Although an agreement on conduct in the South China Sea remains elusive, both parties have indicated the need to de--escalate tensions, including allowing access for fishing vessels from both countries. Nevertheless, China will maintain its incursions into contested waters. Relations between China and the Philippines will remain strained over 2024-28, particularly amid the increasing rivalry between the US and China. There is a highlighted risk of Chinese action against the Philippines, probably in the form of restrictions on trade, investment and travel.
The Philippines' relations with the EU will remain contentious, following the refusal of the Marcos administration to co-operate with the investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) into the "war on drugs". Mr Marcos's stance towards the ICC will soften in the near term; however, this will reflect a focus on domestic issues rather than diplomatic concerns, as he aims to reduce the risk of a domestic coup by Mr Duterte (or his supporters) by compromising the former president.

Overview: As a country with a large and fast-growing market, coupled with a broad-based improvement in its labour market, the Philippines will have an overall score of 6.04 in EIU's forecast period, rising from 5.69 in 2019-23. The likely relaxation of foreign direct investment laws and improved taxation will also help. Faster improvements among peer economies, however, will mean that the country's global rank will fall by two to 58th, while it will remain 12th regionally.
Strengths: Foreign trade, liberal exchange controls and accommodative taxes will remain the country's strong points. The Philippines is more deeply integrated with the regional economy, after it entered the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in mid-2023. The 2021 Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act will help to improve ease-of-doing business, and the Marcos administration has helped to boost compliance.
Weaknesses: Long-standing problems with the country's infrastructure will remain a big drag on the overall score, as well as sub-optimal policy towards private enterprise and competition, owing to the influence of large, monopolistic and politically influential family-run conglomerates. Lack of political stability will remain another major structural weak point.
What to watch
- A renewed commitment to free-trade agreements (FTAs) will support positive changes to the score. We expect that the Philippines will seek and complete membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and establish a trade deal with the EU in 2024-28.
- Rapid wage growth could be destabilising in the early part of the forecast period, owing to the acute political pressure for substantial minimum wage rises in the aftermath of the global cost-of-living crisis.

Business environment outlook: Philippines' business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The Electronic Business One-Stop Shop system (eBOSS) is rolled out further by more local government units, but progress remains highly uneven and slow.
2026-28: State-owned and politically connected family-run conglomerates continue to play a big role at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: The economy starts to see the benefits of 100% foreign ownership in railways, airports, expressways and telecommunications. The 13th Foreign Investment Negative List is published.
2026-28: Foreign direct investment remains low compared with the country's regional peers, owing to slow progress on the liberalisation of investment restrictions via constitutional reforms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Negotiations on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership gain momentum, and trade barriers towards the region are lowered in line with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership's provisions.
2026-28: Talks for a free-trade agreement with the EU reach the final stages, before a change in government.
Taxes 2024-25: A new value-added tax on digital services is introduced, as well as an excise tax on single-use plastics. Corporate and personal-income tax rates remain unchanged. The Strategic Investment Priority Plan is published.
2026-28: The administration takes steps to improve compliance and enforce tax evasion laws more strongly. Corporate tax rates will remain high compared to ASEAN peers, despite the recent reforms.
Financing 2024-25: The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank) resumes its push for the consolidation of small and rural banks to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the weak financial sector, while the structural reduction in high reserve requirements resumes.
2026-28: The trend of bank consolidation and mergers intensifies amid rising competition from peers from other South-east Asian countries, following the deepening of regional economic integration in the services sector. New digital bank licenses are offered, following the current moratorium.
The labour market 2024-25: The upward pressure on minimum wage rates remains acute, owing to the cost-of-living crisis in 2022-23.
2026-28: A "brain drain" remains a major constraint to business expansion. Greater demand for skilled engineers and construction workers for infrastructure projects elevates the likelihood of wage inflation in this industry.
Infrastructure 2024-25: The Cavite-Laguna Expressway project is completed and work begins for the Southern Access Link Expressway.
2026-28: The administration continues to push for private investment in infrastructure development, while financing via the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund gains momentum. The New Manila International Airport begins construction.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Policies will be enacted to encourage the use of mobile payment systems. The rollout of 5G services progresses.
2026-28: Internet broadband infrastructure becomes more reliable in the capital, Manila, and is extended to rural areas. Use of the eGovPH platform for public services becomes more widespread.

Overview: The Philippines' score in this category deteriorates to 6.6 in 2024-28, from 6.9 in the historical period, owing solely to a less robust outlook for government debt. This will see its global rank plunge to 52nd, from 37th, while its regional position will slip by one spot, to 13th.
Strengths: The country's strengths lie partly in the quality of its economic institutions and the sound policies that are pursued, as a result. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank), for instance, was one of the most aggressive central banks in the region in terms of its response to the 2022-23 global cost-of-living crisis; it increased its benchmark rate by 450 basis points in total, demonstrating commitment to price stability and maintaining the exchange rate.
Weaknesses: The budget deficit-6.2% of GDP in 2023-remains wide compared with developing Asia and the country's average deficit of 2.4% in 2015-19. The debt/GDP ratio rose to over 60% in 2021 and has remained elevated since then, far above the 2019 level of 42%. We expect only a steady narrowing of the deficit to 4.8% of GDP by 2028.
What to watch
- The new finance secretary, Ralph Recto, will follow his predecessors' key commitments, such as narrowing the deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of 2028, while introducing no "new" taxes, apart from those already planned. These include a proposed value-added tax on digital services and an excise tax on single-use plastics. This promise of predictability will be tested during the forecast period, as continued fiscal consolidation amid cooling economic growth and slowing inflation will be much tougher to achieve.
- Mr Marcos will need to expand his efforts in order to maintain the Philippines' reputation for reform that had been garnered under the efforts of previous presidents, Benigno Aquino (fiscal prudence) and Rodrigo Duterte (tax reform, infrastructure investment). Mr Marcos's first two years have seen little in the way of major reform, apart from the establishment of the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund in July 2023, which has yet to be fully capitalised and whose investment plans remain vague and undefined.

Overview: The Philippines' score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will rise modestly in the forecast period, from 4.5 in 2019-23 to 4.8. Faster improvements elsewhere will push down its global and regional rank to 65th and 13th, respectively, from 58th and 11th. The improvement will stem from better protections for minority shareholders, although the bar for any progress on this is very low. Such gains should be anchored by the country's efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, a free-trade bloc), as well as the formal resumption of negotiations in March 2024 for an FTA with the EU. Improvement will be offset partially by greater state control over certain parts of the economy in 2024-28.
Strengths: In recent years the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued regulations, enhancing minority shareholders' powers and rights and protection of private property remains one of the country's strengths, together-albeit to a smaller extent-with the freedom of businesses to compete and the level of government regulation. Ongoing efforts to reduce red tape include the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, of which the full impact has yet to be realised. The liberalisation envisaged under the ASEAN Economic Community (a single market for members) will continue to create new opportunities.
Weaknesses: Structurally, family-run conglomerates with substantial vested interests will retain strong influence on policymaking, prolonging the sub-optimal environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) will continue to face difficulties in its effort to break down these monopolies and target trust practices.
What to watch
- Intra-country trade friction should ease in the forecast period, following an executive order that took effect in September 2023, which suspended the so-called "pass-through fees" that local governments collect when goods transported on national roads cross different jurisdictions.
- The Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act created the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA). ARTA faces internal and external challenges, such as corruption. Progress on one of its key initiatives-the Electronic Business One-Stop Shop (eBOSS)-remains patchy, suggesting poor and uneven enforcement. The system, which aims to automate the process of obtaining business permits, was meant to be rolled out nationwide in 2021. However, as at May 2024, only 35 local government units-out of more than 1,600-have been certified as fully compliant. The government aims to raise this count to 200 in 2024.
- The Philippine Competition Commission will remain critical in the forecast period. Most recently in March 2024, the commission raised the mandatory notification threshold for mergers and acquisitions, making it easier for smaller companies to compete with scale. It has also established "i-Stations" outside the capital, Manila (in Cebu, Davao, Legazpi Cty and Baguino City), to better monitor, investigate and take enforcement action against anti-competitive practices outside the capital, where SMEs are likely to have an even bigger disadvantage.

Overview: The Philippines' score for policy towards foreign investment will rise to 6.9 in 2024-28, from 6.0 in the historical period. This will push up the country's rank globally from 54th to 48th, but it will not be enough to prevent its regional position from deteriorating from tenth to 12th, because of much faster improvements by its closest competitors. The government's policy towards foreign investment will be more welcome, especially as competition will be fierce within ASEAN and the broader emerging-market sphere for investments that aim to minimise companies' dependence on and exposure to China.
Strengths: Much of the improvement will stem from legislation signed by Mr Duterte just before he left office. This includes amendments to the 2000 Retail Trade Liberalisation Act, the Foreign Investment Act and the Public Investment Act. The most important revisions to the latter include allowing foreign investors to own SMEs with a lower minimum of paid-in capital (US$100,000). The government will enjoy some success in opening up financial services further, anchored by its obligations under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework.
Weaknesses: Significant obstacles to FDI are likely to persist outside the realm of corporate ownership rules, including the ban on foreigners owning land. An element of political risk comes from changes to the Public Investment Act that give the country's president the power to review investments that could threaten national security. Admittedly, this safeguard is reasonable in light of the significant liberalisations made in key sectors; telecommunications, airports, shipping and highways as public service have been opened up to full foreign ownership.
What to watch
- Constitutional reform to reduce more entrenched barriers to FDI is back on the agenda, with Mr Marcos considering a proposed referendum to coincide with the 2025 midterm elections. Positive momentum is building; in March 2024 the House of Representatives (the lower house of the Philippines' bicameral parliament) passed Resolution of Both Houses No.7, which would lift constitutional barriers to FDI in utilities, education and advertising. Admittedly, pressure from vested interests (particularly powerful conglomerate families) will continue to complicate the path to charter change, as previous governments have found.
- The authorities will continue to operate the Foreign Investment Negative List system, which specifies the sectors in which participation is restricted. No fixed timetables are set for any changes, but the 13th edition will give an indication of the Marcos administration's priorities in terms of FDI reform. The National Economic and Development Authority stated in January 2024 that the next version would bring a simplification of regulations, at the very least.
- The previous administration's efforts to reopen a few industries-to develop futures streams of revenue for the government-should unlock the door to foreign (and domestic) entrants in 2024-28. These measures include the lifting of a ban on new mines and a moratorium on new casinos.

Overview: The score for the foreign trade and exchange controls category will remain at 7.8 in the forecast period. The absence of forward movement means that the Philippines' global ranking will drop by five spots to 53rd, while its position in Asia will fall by one, to 11th.
Strengths: The country's profile is bolstered by its general openness to trade, and the peso will continue to be freely convertible for current-account and most capital-account transactions. Trade barriers are more likely to be lowered than raised, owing to external dependence. This was exhibited most recently in June 2024, when Mr Marcos approved a large reduction in import tariffs for the staple food, rice, from 35% to 15% for five years.
Weaknesses: The Philippines' main weakness is its partially closed capital account. Constitutional barriers to foreign investment, in particular, are likely to remain in some form throughout the forecast period and beyond, even if some partial reforms are approved next year.
What to watch
- Formal negotiations over an FTA with the EU resumed in March 2024 and should make meaningful progress in 2024-28. Bilateral relations have undergone a positive reset since the end of the Duterte administration, which was chastised by the EU for alleged human-rights abuses. An FTA is vital for EU market access, as the Philippines will not enjoy preferential access once it graduates from lower-middle-income status (which could happen in 2028, based on recent growth trends).
- The government will continue to lower tariffs in line with the RCEP. This took effect for the Philippines in June 2023, but it will take time for the benefits to materialise fully, because of variations in the tariff-reduction schedule and the extremely long timeframes for the most protected sectors. Still, the agreement is expected to lower rates on 98% of goods.
- The Philippines is likely to seek even more ambitious bilateral FTAs in 2024-28, even with countries that have shared RCEP links. The FTA signed with South Korea in September 2023 is a case in point, as the deal includes provisions-absent from the ASEAN-South Korea FTA-that will specifically benefit Philippine agriculture.

Business environment outlook: Taxes

2019-23 2024-28 2019-23 2024-28 2019-23 2024-28
6.3 6.8 40 37 10 11
a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 17 geographies: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: The Philippines' score for taxes will improve to 6.8 in the forecast period, from 6.3 in 2019-23, moving the country up to 37th globally, from 40th. However, the increase in score will not be enough to prevent a marginal drop in the country's regional ranking, from tenth to 11th. The improvement will be due in large part to the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) initiative, which reduces the corporate tax rate and rationalises fiscal incentives. The rate was lowered from 30% to 25% from 2020, and SMEs benefit from a rate of 20%. The rate levied on foreign companies will fall in stages to a terminal rate of 20% by 2027, enabling fair competition.
Strengths: Policy is likely to remain largely predictable in the forecast period, following the major reforms pursued by the previous government. The finance secretary attached himself to his predecessor's pledge to introduce no "new" taxes apart from those that were under discussion prior to the start of the Marcos administration. Predictability in terms of fiscal incentives is enshrined in the CREATE Act; the president has the authority to apply preferential tax measures for a period of up to 40 years. The top marginal rate of personal income tax, at 35%, is relatively high by regional standards but still attractive globally. The same description is applicable to employers' social security obligations; companies currently have to contribute 9.5%, following a one-percentage-point rise in 2023.
Weaknesses: The main components holding back the score relate to incentives for investment and the fairness and complexity of the tax system-issues that recent tax reforms have only partially addressed. Owing in part to the complexity of the rules, alongside the high level of corruption and inadequate enforcement, there remains a need to widen the tax base and boost compliance. The reduction in corporate income tax rates in 2020 did not make the country competitive overnight; the Philippines still has some of the highest tax rates in the region. In the early part of the forecast period, at least, more generous fiscal incentives for investment are likely to be held back, with the budget deficit still over-extended.
What to watch
- The main efforts to watch will be implementation of reform focussed on improving compliance. The Ease of Paying Taxes Act, signed into law in January 2024, necessitates the issuance of a value-added tax (VAT) invoice for every transaction (with concessions for micro and small firms, such as lower penalties and shorter tax returns). The Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform Act, signed in June 2024, should boost compliance with property taxes. It will offer a two-year amnesty on penalties for unpaid property taxes. Another area of interest is whether the fourth package under the previous government's Comprehensive Tax Reform Programme is pushed through. This element would simplify taxes on passive income and other financial instruments.
- The most likely broadening of the tax base will come in the form of VAT on digital transactions, such as payments for streaming. In May 2024 the upper house unanimously approved a bill imposing 12% VAT on such services, even if the service provider does not have a physical presence domestically. Failure to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to remit the VAT collected could result in the local blockage or suspension of their service. A few key sectors are exempt, however, such as education and banking and non-banking financial intermediation. The bill is now awaiting the president's signature; a similar proposal was approved by the lower house in 2022.
- The next iteration of the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP), due in 2025, will outline any changes to fiscal incentives. At its most basic level, the SIPP lists the areas that are eligible for incentives. Generally, the most favourable terms are offered to export-oriented companies and those that are located outside the capital-a guiding principle that is unlikely to change.

Overview: The Philippines' score for financing will remain unchanged in the forecast period, at 5.9. Improvements elsewhere will mean that the country's global position drops by 15 places, to 61st, while its regional rank will fall from tenth to 12th.
Strengths: Foreign banks are allowed to enter the market with no investment restrictions. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act, passed in 2021, allows banks to sell off non-performing loans (NPLs) to asset-management companies and has helped to lower NPLs. The financial system will become more integrated with the wider ASEAN market. Under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF), a small number of ASEAN banks will be licensed to operate across the bloc. As ABIF operates largely on a bilateral level, however, progress on regional financial integration is likely to remain very uneven.
Weaknesses: The financial sector remains small and simple, with activity concentrated in basic bank and non-bank lending and deposit-taking. The regulatory environment is particularly conservative, especially when it comes to emerging industry trends. In 2021 the BSP shut the door for new digital bank licences for at least three years, to monitor the impact of these institutions. As far as we can surmise, this study is still ongoing; however, the BSP governor, Eli Remolona, stated reassuringly in October 2023 that this moratorium could be lifted in the foreseeable future. At the moment, only six digital banks are in operation.
What to watch
- The central bank will continue to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in 2024-28, structurally releasing more funds to the system. At 9.5%, the Philippines still has one of the highest legally mandatory ratios relative to its regional peers at the same level of development (even though it has been reduced from 20% since 2018). The end goal is to lower the RRR to 5%.

Business environment outlook: The labour market

Overview: A broad-based improvement in this area will boost the Philippines' labour market score substantially to 7.0 in 2024-28, from 5.6 in the historical period. This will boost the country's global and regional rankings to 17th and fourth respectively, from 58th and 13th. More competitive labour costs, an overall improvement in skills, better health outcomes and a smaller risk of industrial disputes will underpin this material improvement.
Strengths: The country has a large pool of English-speaking surplus labour. The cost of firing workers is lower than in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Minimum wages vary across the country, preventing overly restrictive conditions in less developed areas. Philippine unions have a reputation for militancy, but the rate of unionisation will remain low in 2024-28, with fewer than 5% of workers belonging to a union.
Weaknesses: Skills shortages caused by a "brain drain" remain a long-standing problem, as more than 2m migrant Filipino workers are hired overseas each year. The most popular destinations for migration are the Gulf states and Singapore, although there are substantial flows to countries with historically large Filipino diaspora populations, such as the US. Europe has become a more popular destination in recent years, accounting for over 9% of total overseas foreign workers since 2021 (up from around 6.5% five years previously).
What to watch
- The past few years of elevated inflation are likely to exert further upward pressure on wage expectations and on lawmakers to pass further minimum-wage increases. Both houses of the legislature are mulling a proposal for a P100/day increase across the board. Such a raise is unlikely to be as destabilising to the labour market in the capital, Manila, as elsewhere. As at the first quarter of 2024 the rate in the capital (in real terms) was down by 7% from its peak in 2016. The ex-Manila level has risen by 6.5% over the same period.
- The problem of brain drain could intensify in the early years of our forecast period. Indeed, the BSP's data show that overseas placements jumped to a record high of 2.4m in 2023, from 1.2m the year before, surpassing the pre-pandemic peak in 2019 by 475,000.

Overview: The Philippines' infrastructure score will weaken to 4.5 in 2024-28, from 5.0 in the historical period, because of a worsening in relative internet speeds and a material increase in commercial rents. That said, this deterioration will be offset in part by a more reliable electricity supply (albeit from a very low base). The country's global and regional positions will fall by 15 and five places respectively, to 72nd and 14th.
Strengths: Infrastructure spending has been a key focus for the government since the Duterte administration. Government infrastructure spending rose to about 4.5% of GDP by the end of his term, up from just under 3% when he came into office. Mr Marcos has built on this progress, raising the annual rolling share to 5% of GDP by the first quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, hold-ups in capital spending should be expected, as some projects face lengthy delays from a lethargic bureaucracy and exposure to natural disasters.
Weaknesses: High logistics costs, due to the country's poor road network and ports, and its patchy power supply, will continue to impose high operating costs on businesses. The country also lacks reliable railways, partly as a result of the archipelago's topography. The government will remain highly dependent on bilateral loans and official development assistance to fund projects, at least early in the forecast period, when the fiscal deficit is likely to remain elevated. In a similar vein, the public-private partnership model should continue to account for part of the funding, especially for highway projects. A new channel for funding will be established once the Maharlika sovereign wealth fund is up and running.
What to watch
- The government might take control of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Although this could hamper energy efficiency, businesses could benefit from lower energy costs. Fraught relations between the Philippines and China could speed up the takeover of the NGCP, which is currently 40% owned by China's State Grid Corporation.
- Investment into renewable energy will receive renewed support in 2024-28, following the resumption in February 2024 of the collection of feed-in-tariff allowances charged to consumers. Introduced by the 2008 Renewable Energy Act, this charge goes into a fund that helps to pay developers of green energy.
- Major developments in 2024-28 will remain largely focused on transport, where local governments enjoy greater autonomy in the planning stage. The ongoing-and partially opened-P35.7bn Cavite-Laguna Expressway project should be completed by the end of 2024, connecting some of the biggest export-processing zones with ports in Batangas and Manila. In 2022 the previous government signed a toll agreement with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) for the P152.4bn Southern Access Link Expressway, paving the way for its construction. The project is intended in part to provide access to the New Manila International Airport, the construction of which will start in 2026. SMC is also modernising the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, currently the Philippines' main international gateway.

Overview: The Philippines' score for technological readiness will strengthen to 5.8 in the forecast period, from 4.9 in 2019-23, on the back of greater internet penetration, reduced exposure to cyber-security threats and a more conducive climate for research and development. However, the country's global position will improve by only two spots, to 62nd, while its position in Asia-where competitor countries will make greater strides-will slip by one place, to 12th.
Strengths: Mobile internet access will improve significantly, particularly among younger, urban consumers. Progress will also be noticeable in rural areas, where establishing fixed connectivity remains challenging. The availability of cheap mobile phones remains a big driver; Chinese manufacturers (such as Realme, Transsion, Oppo and Xiaomi) continue to dominate smartphone sales in the country, owing to their cost competitiveness.
Weaknesses: The Philippines' dominant telecoms providers will unveil new mobile infrastructure, but internet speeds will remain among the slowest in the region. The Philippines is also still relatively weak in terms of internet use. The latest data from the International Telecommunication Union show that 53% of the population was using the internet in 2021, below Indonesia's 62% (the fairest regional comparison) and the global average of 63%.
What to watch
- The private sector will engage heavily in the implementation of plans to digitalise government services. The eGovPH mobile application was launched in June 2023, providing a one-stop shop for national and local services, such as business registrations and tax payments. Security assessments, the development of central storage and encryption of data will be important in 2024-28, as the usage of this platform grows in tandem with its functionality. The effective implementation of this strategy would reduce the risk of major data breaches, but exposure will remain high compared to the country's regional peers. More than 72m people could use eGovPH to access their digital ID as at May 2024.
- Increased risk of cyber-attacks and new regulations during the forecast period will prompt companies to upgrade their defences, although implementation will be inconsistent across sectors. In the meantime, the threat level in the Philippines will remain acute, partly because of tensions with China over disputed territory in the South China Sea. Resecurity, a US cybersecurity company, found that malicious internet activity against the Philippines increased by more than 300% in the first four months of 2024 from the end of 2023, with most attacks geared towards reducing the public's trust in official government bodies.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The Marcos administration has set out a socioeconomic agenda that focuses on improving food security by reducing costs through "Kadiwa stores", which directly link farmers and consumers; creating better quality and green jobs; strengthening social protection; improving bureaucratic efficiency; promoting sound fiscal management; upholding security; and reducing entry barriers to increase market competition. However, legislation to promote this agenda has made slow progress. We expect this trend to continue, given loose party affiliations and the contradictory nature of some of these reforms.
The president is also keen to attract foreign investment by opening up various sectors and negotiating free-trade deals. This effort will include more initiatives aimed at improving the business environment, such as infrastructure enhancements and efforts to liberalise the country's regulatory regime governing foreign investment. A business-friendly political agenda will ensure the delivery of a phased reduction in corporate tax from 30% to 20% by 2029 (signed into law in 2021). Nonetheless, endemic corruption and inefficient bureaucracy will impair the progress of these reforms, dampening multinational firms' enthusiasm for expanding their footprint.
The poor state of infrastructure remains one of the main impediments to doing business in the Philippines. Mr Marcos will build upon the infrastructure programme introduced by his predecessor. This will include the Metro Manila Subway Project, which will eventually link Quezon City to the north of the capital with Parañaque to the south. Tunnel boring began in 2023, and the project, which is being financed through soft loans from Japan, has an estimated completion date of 2028. However, other projects will struggle for public funding, given the government's current focus on fiscal discipline following a surge in public debt. Instead, the administration will seek financing from the private sector. A lack of commitment to public funding will exacerbate delays, along with corruption and bureaucratic inertia.
The Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), a sovereign wealth fund launched in July 2023, is expected to finance 197 high-impact infrastructure flagship projects worth around P8.7trn (US$157bn). However, the fund has a poorly designed governance structure; all of its board members are appointed by the president, which might benefit project approval but could also give rise to concerns over favouritism and corruption. As the government is using dividends from state-owned financial institutions to finance the fund, it will not only weaken the government's fiscal standing, but is also likely to squeeze the space for fiscal spending elsewhere on non-infrastructure projects.

Government revenue 15.7 16.0 16.2 16.2 16.0 15.9
Budget balance -6.2 -5.9 -5.5 -5.5 -5.3 -4.8
In 2024 the government's priorities will be to reduce public debt, tame inflation and accelerate economic growth. According to its medium-term fiscal framework, the government aims to reduce its debt as a percentage of GDP from 63.2% in 2023 to 60% by 2025; we believe that this is unlikely, because of higher interest payments, weak growth prospects in 2024 and an anticipated increase in fiscal spending in 2025. We expect a larger budget allocation for agriculture (to ensure adequate food supply) and social protection, via the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Programme (a cash-transfer programme) and the Social Pension for Indigent Citizens. Infrastructure spending will rise modestly, but the government will rely on external financing to support these projects, which may lead to a delay in implementation. The administration will focus on the so-called "golden age of infrastructure" (previously championed by Mr Duterte) through the Build Better More programme, with a proposed allocation of P1.42trn in 2024. With weak economic activity and pressure on the government to provide support to the population, in view of elevated inflation and the upcoming election in 2025, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow only slightly, from 6.2% of GDP in 2023 to 5.9% of GDP in 2024.
The government has an overambitious target of the deficit falling to 3% of GDP in 2028; we expect it to narrow to 4.8% of GDP by that year. The government will seek additional sources of tax revenue, such as value-added tax (VAT) on digital services, but high interest payments on debt and support for low-income households will keep the budget deficit wide. Reductions in corporate tax rates and import duty on rice will also weigh on revenue in the short term.
The government plans to finance its deficit through the issuance of new bonds and borrowing from multilateral organisations. Although we expect central-government debt as a share of GDP to decline to just below 60% over the forecast period, it will remain higher than before the pandemic, when public debt was below 40% of GDP.

Amid upside risks to the inflation trajectory and relatively robust economic growth, we expect the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank) to hold the policy rate at 6.75% until September, and to cut it by 25 basis points at its October meeting. This will be aimed at maintaining the interest-rate differential, following anticipated monetary easing by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). We expect cuts to total 125 basis points by the end of 2025.
We anticipate that the BSP will reach a neutral level for the policy rate in 2027-28, at about 4%, with inflation expected to remain comfortably within its target range.

We expect real GDP to grow by 5.4% in 2024. Exports of goods and services from the Philippines will rebound in 2024, particularly in the second half of the year, as the global electronics sector enters a cyclical upswing. However, trade disruption in the Red Sea and higher shipping costs will have a countervailing effect, although currency depreciation will boost exports. We expect domestic consumption growth to be fairly resilient, despite high interest rates, owing to the government's support measures for farmers and cash handouts ahead of the parliamentary election in 2025. Investment will pick up, backed largely by the government as it tries to push for infrastructure development. Reforms in the Public Services Act of 2023, which opened up six previously closed public utility sectors to 100% foreign ownership, will help to attract foreign investment.
For the remainder of the forecast period (2025-28), we expect real GDP to grow at an annual average rate of 6%. The economy will receive a strong push from increased government spending in 2025, an election year. We consequently expect consumption to increase but mainly to benefit imports rather than domestic production activity. The removal of entry and ownership restrictions on foreign businesses and gains from supply-chain diversification will drive investment growth in the medium term, but will not replace consumption as the major growth-driver of the economy. Despite some regional diversification of supply chains from China, the Philippines' manufacturing sector is less well placed than its regional peers (such as Vietnam) to benefit significantly from this trend, owing to a heavier tax burden and weaker infrastructure. However, exports in the services sector (business outsourcing and tourism, for example) will resume their steady upward trajectory over 2024-28, as labour costs rise in developed markets.
The severe economic contraction during the pandemic and the subsequent slowdown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean that real GDP levels in 2024-28 will remain below how the economy could have performed under the pre-pandemic growth trend.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The share of agriculture as a percentage of GDP will decline in the forecast period, reflecting continuing structural transformation. Agriculture (within which productivity gains are typically slower than in manufacturing or services) contributes little to overall economic growth, although it is a labour-intensive sector and remains a major source of employment in rural areas. Severe weather events, such as frequent typhoons and extreme dry spells, will continue to disrupt the sector's productivity, given the increasing impact of climate change. We expect the agriculture sector to grow at an annual average rate of 1% in 2024-28.
Industry will remain the second-largest sector in the economy, accounting for about 40% 0f GDP in 2024-28. With the government's push towards building public infrastructure and efforts to attract foreign investment in manufacturing, the sector will grow at an average rate of 5.4% in the forecast period, albeit slower than the pre-pandemic average of 6.9% in 2015-19. This reflects an industrialisation process in the Philippines that has been characterised by low levels of foreign invest-ment and innovation. However, the country will still record some growth in manufacturing, as its English-speaking and relatively cheap labour force attracts foreign investors and businesses. Furthermore, the government's efforts to improve the business climate and relax restrictions on foreign ownership will boost the sector's fortunes in the longer term, amid the global diversification of supply chains, although this will pale in comparison with its regional peers.
Services will remain the Philippine economy's largest sector. With a pick-up in tourism, we expect the sector to expand by an annual average of around 6.7% in 2024-28. The telecommunications sector will continue to grow briskly as the new government proceeds with the rollout of 5G networks. Business-process outsourcing will remain the largest source of services income in the forecast period. The sector will be at risk from rising competition and automation, including the use of artificial intelligence to replace "low-skilled" service jobs, such as customer centre workers.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.6 1.7 1.9
We forecast that inflation will moderate to 3.4% in 2024, within the BSP's target range of 2-4%. However, there are upside risks to this forecast, notably further currency depreciation, higher oil prices and low agricultural production caused by extreme weather events. Higher shipping costs caused by disruption in the Red Sea will also push up prices for perishables; the Philippines is highly dependent on imports of food, which accounts for nearly 40% of the consumer price index basket. With economic activity remaining below trend, upside risks to inflation present the BSP with an awkward monetary policy dilemma. Producer prices will fall in line with energy prices and anticipated deflation in industrial goods. Record-high producer inflation in 2022 also indicates a cyclical downturn in prices over the next couple of years.
Looking further ahead, our central scenario assumes that a modest appreciation in the peso from 2025, neutral interest rates and consistent growth in consumer spending will keep inflation under control in the remainder of the forecast period, at an annual average of 3.3% in 2025-28 (remaining within the central bank's target band).

We forecast that the peso will depreciate to P59.5:US$1 by end-2024, from P55.6:US$1 a year earlier. Geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea, a delay in the anticipated rate cut by the Fed and higher oil prices will put the peso under additional pressure as capital flows towards markets that offer higher risk-adjusted returns.
For the rest of the forecast period, robust macroeconomic fundamentals will support a strengthening of the peso as inflation moderates, economic activity rebounds (supported by strong exports and domestic consumption) and interest rates remain constant. However, appreciation will be limited by a persistent current-account deficit and the peso's reputation as a risky currency to hold. We expect the peso to appreciate, albeit slowly, drawing close to the P54.4:US$1 threshold in 2028 (in annual average terms).

We forecast that the current-account deficit will widen to 3% of GDP in 2024, from an estimated 2.6% of GDP in 2023. This deficit will be the result of higher oil prices and a currency depreciation that will widen the trade deficit on goods, as the Philippines is a net importer of oil. A growing surplus on services trade, due to higher tourist arrivals, will help to support the current account. Remittances will keep the secondary income account firmly in surplus.
We anticipate a strong increase in imports in 2025, driven by a government push towards spending and increased consumption demand; this will keep the current-account balance in deficit. However, the services and secondary surpluses will continue to cushion the deficit on the trade balance and will return the current account to a mild surplus of 0.3% of GDP by 2028.
With the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (a mega-regional trade deal) now in effect, the Philippines will shift its focus to trade talks with the EU and will make efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in the latter part of our forecast period. We do not expect a trade deal with the EU to be signed by 2028.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Philippines Stocks and flows Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into the Philippines declined by 23.2% in 2022, to US$9.2bn, according to the latest annual data from UNCTAD. The stock of FDI increased to only US$113bn (about 28% of GDP), less than in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia but higher than in Indonesia. Monthly data covering much of 2023 suggest another bad year for FDI growth, pointing to a decline from 2022. Tight US monetary policy is playing a role, with high yields reducing the need to search for value elsewhere (although that hasn't stopped other Asian economies recording strong FDI growth in 2023, amid supply-chain reorganisation). The Philippines misses out because of its underdeveloped manufacturing base and FDI restrictions, which have been only partially relaxed in recent years.
Origin and distribution In 2022 Japan was the principal source of FDI in the Philippines, followed by the US, according to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank). Net FDI of US$610m came from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the largest contribution from Singapore, followed by Malaysia. Despite the efforts of the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, to attract investment from China, net FDI from that country fell in 2022. The sectors attracting the greatest interest from foreign investors include business-process outsourcing and the manufacture of electronics products. The Philippines' labour costs are not among the lowest in the region, but the population's widespread English-language skills and an improving telecommunications infrastructure, alongside incremental regulatory reform, should support FDI in these sectors in the next few years.
Determinants Reforms in opening up the FDI sector will allow international investors greater access to the domestic market. Recent examples include changes to allow new foreign investors to fully own domestic firms for the first time; a reduction to entry barriers for foreign retail operations; and the Public Services Act, which allows foreign investors to fully own certain public services, including, most recently, renewable energy. Still, many sectors remain off limits, as detailed in the Foreign Investment Negative List. The government has brought in new powers to limit foreign ownership under the auspices of national security-powers that could be open to manipulation by vested interests. While the direction of travel is positive, the Philippines' investment environment remains relatively illiberal.
Impact Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 the Philippines has attracted FDI chiefly into its electronics sector, which is now an integral part of the global supply chain. This has helped to create a more stable and value-added source of export receipts compared to commodities such as agricultural produce. However, this has not led to a wholesale change in business practices. Vested interests remain influential and lobby for protectionism against foreign competition. That limits the positive spillovers from FDI to business culture and practices, as well as the transfer of skills and know-how. Partly as a result, the Philippines' manufacturing base remains small, leaving the country unable to capitalise on the global trend for supply-chain reorganisation, which has benefited many neighbouring Asian countries.
Potential Mr Marcos has promised to maintain his predecessor's course of improving the investing environment, but has not offered any clear plans to build upon recent reforms. The president hopes that his foreign policy pivot towards the US can help to bring in more foreign investment from that country. However, that can only go so far. Ultimately, foreign investment decisions will depend on further opening up and improvements in the business environment that would make the Philippines an attractive destination for global capital. A young labour force, a geographic location in the middle of many manufacturing powerhouses and supply chains, an English-speaking population and a growing domestic market all provide potential. Nevertheless, that will only be realised if the government can keep up its reform momentum.

Population growth will slow in the longer term, but only gradually The Philippines' population growth rate will moderate marginally compared to the historical period, but will remain relatively rapid and among the highest in South-east Asia in 2024-28, at 1.4% per year on average. This compares with projected growth rates of less than 1% in Indonesia and Vietnam, which boast a comparable GDP per person. This is attributable to the Roman Catholic church's opposition to birth control, as well as a cultural preference for large families. The latter is an especially strong factor for poor families, as children are expected to contribute to the household income when they reach working age. A further factor supporting robust population growth is rising life expectancy as healthcare services and diets improve. Nonetheless, increasing incomes and greater female participation in the workforce will serve to constrain the rate of population growth. Notably, the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, went against the Catholic church and launched a campaign to raise awareness of family planning before his term ended in June 2022. Medical centres are now mandated to distribute free contra-ception to poor families, which will also temper population growth beyond the forecast period.
Inequality of income will remain glaring in the forecast period A combination of decent population growth and unequal distribution of wealth and economic opportunity has contributed to endemic poverty across the country. Moreover, poverty remains much more prevalent among women and children than men. Successive previous administrations failed to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The government has traditionally extended spending on social welfare programmes and healthcare, but the disbursement of funding remains problematic. The pandemic exacerbated the plight of the poor, as they suffered the brunt of the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. The incidence of poverty will remain elevated during the forecast period.
An increase in low-quality jobs will result in depressed wages Despite a further decline in the unemployment rate and an increase in the labour force participation rate in 2024, job growth remains worryingly dependent on low-paying roles in the agriculture and services sectors, as well as part-time or informal arrangements. An increase in the share of self-employed workers indicates the development of an informal labour market. This has limited growth in nominal wages, adding to the pressures on real income growth from recent bouts of inflation.
Outbound labour migration remains a feature For decades a large number of Filipinos have had to travel overseas in search of more profitable employment. According to government data, there were an estimated 6m Filipinos overseas, including more than 2m as official overseas foreign workers (as opposed to permanent migrants). Permanent migrants from the Philippines have settled mostly in the US and Canada, while temporary workers are concentrated in the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Gulf states. Significant outward migration remains a feature of the Philippines. Demand for Filipino healthcare workers is strong in the West, owing to their proficiency in English. Although this has helped to mitigate the country's unemployment problem, concerns persist about the long-term "brain-drain" effect of the departure of so many people.
One effect of the country's high birth rate and relatively low life expectancy is a low old-age dependency ratio, meaning that the cost to the productive members of the population of maintaining the pensions of the economically dependent will remain low in the forecast period.

A relatively low level of GDP per head could limit market opportunities We forecast economic output in the Philippines at about US$460bn in 2024-small when considered against major ASEAN economies but still larger than Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. The Philippines is a low income market, with GDP per head of US$3,726 at market exchange rates and US$10,756 in terms of purchasing power parity in 2023. GDP per head will continue to rise in 2024 and beyond. Resuming a steady (if slightly less robust) growth trajectory from 2024, GDP per head will reach around US$6,300 at market exchange rates by the end of the forecast period. However, the Philippines will continue to lag behind South-east Asia's richer economies, with a lower level of GDP per head than Malaysia and Thailand, but higher than Indonesia. Severe income inequality will also remain an issue. Disparity between the richest and poorest households will continue to be particularly acute in urban areas. However, about 50% of the country's population is under 25 years old, ensuring a continued supply of new consumers in the coming years and boosting demand for more innovative products and sales channels.
Favourable demographics and healthy economic growth will support the country's retail sector in the wake of the pandemic. We expect real growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector to average almost 6% per year in 2024-28. Increasing affluence and rising urbanisation will lift demand for goods supplied by modern chain stores. Nonetheless, small traditional shops and markets are likely to remain the dominant retail channels. Online platforms will emerge as a major medium for transactions to cater to technologically savvy young consumers-a trend that has been accelerated by the pandemic.
Organised retailing in the Philippines is dominated by four major local companies, the largest of which is SM Investment. The group's retail arms are SM Prime Holdings (which operates shopping centres) and SM Retail. Market liberalisation will probably lead to greater participation of foreign businesses in the retail sectors, as they are now subject to a lower capital investment threshold and are no longer required to sell almost one-third of their equity to the public within eight years of starting operations. However, some restrictions, such as land ownership, continue to apply, which will probably prevent foreign-owned retailers from challenging the dominance of the four domestic giants.
Meanwhile, the rural poor, who mostly rely on subsistence farming for a living, will benefit only to the extent that the government directs its spending towards them. Government transfers have facilitated growth in private consumption among lower income brackets in recent years. However, such growth is prone to setbacks, as the rural population is particularly vulnerable to change in government policy priorities, as well as extreme weather conditions.
Remittance inflows will continue to support domestic consumption Inflows of remittances from Filipinos working abroad will continue to grow steadily and buoy consumer expenditure. Furthermore, banks are moving away from their traditional areas of activity and are placing more emphasis on retail financial products sold via digital channels, such as personal loans, insurance policies and credit cards; these trends will enhance consumer opportunities by tapping into the previously hard-to-reach populace.

Consumer spending on food accounted for 40.8% of total household expenditure in 2023, reflecting high inflation and slow growth in real household income. Food, beverages and tobacco will continue to dominate household spending in the forecast period, while accounting for a progressively smaller share of total expenditure. Increasing affluence and urbanisation will lift demand for goods supplied by modern chain stores. Convenience-store retailing is also set to expand rapidly in the forecast period after the pandemic, reflecting both rising incomes and changing working practices. Nonetheless, small traditional shops and markets are likely to remain the dominant retail channels. Wet markets and small sari-sari convenience stores, which are mostly run by low-income households, will remain popular.

Initial conditions: After gaining independence from the US in 1946, the Philippines spent many years in a political crisis, during which the economy lost momentum and poverty rocketed. The country had strong growth potential owing to its large and young population, relatively high standards of education and natural resources. Nevertheless, excessive protection of local manufacturing (leading to the misuse of resources), along with years of kleptocracy, corruption and institutional weakness, distorted both the formulation and the implementation of coherent economic policy. The promotion of the labour-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing sector in the mid-1970s improved standards of living, but the economy continued to underperform, owing to the country's poor infra-structure and institutional weakness.
Demographic trends: The Philippines has a large youth population, with over 30% estimated to be below 15 years of age (the second-highest level in Asia, after Pakistan). By contrast, the proportion of the population aged above 65 is only a touch over 5%, significantly below its regional peers. This has resulted in a demographic dividend that gives the Philippines an edge over other countries, alongside the fact that it has a primarily English-speaking population. However, a lack of prospects for skilled workers means that many will seek opportunities in overseas markets, resulting in a significant "brain drain" from the country.
External conditions: Electronic goods account for more than 50% of total goods exports. In 2021-30 the Philippines will continue to face competition from other manufacturing hubs in the region, such as Indonesia and Vietnam. This will force the country to double down on its traditional strength in the services sector in the long term, as successive governments try to boost job creation and the competitiveness of the economy.
EIU expects the Philippines to remain committed to free trade and to become part of new bilateral and multilateral trade agreements in 2024-50. As such, its external sector will become more diversified, and it will have access to more markets. The good English-language skills of the Philippine labour force will remain vital to the country's competitive position vis-à-vis its peers in the region. A significant reduction in the number of Filipinos seeking jobs abroad is unlikely in the next decade or so, as the local economy will have difficulty absorbing a relatively fast-growing population.
The Philippines' membership of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will provide stimulus for trade. The ASEAN Economic Community is progressively lowering tariffs as part of wider plans to establish a single market. We believe that ASEAN will continue to make slow progress towards this goal during the remainder of the current decade. The Philippines is also a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which is now in force and will help to streamline a number of processes for international trade. A free-trade agreement with the EU, ASEAN's second-largest trading partner (after China), has also been proposed and could come to fruition by the end of this decade.
Institutions and policy trends: Political stability has mostly been ensured for the past decade under successive presidents, although political opposition at times threatened to stall decisions from the executive. The political and security situation in the Bangsamoro region of the southern island of Mindanao is improving but will remain delicate. The establishment in 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was an important step forward in a peace process designed to end decades of armed conflict between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government. With Bangsamoro supposed to elect its own parliament in 2025, thus concluding the transition to autonomy, efforts at stabilisation will remain crucial. The maintenance of political stability will be the key to guaranteeing economic policy certainty and a focus on development in the coming decades.
One of the weakest aspects of the Philippines' political system is the emphasis on personality and patronage, rather than party allegiances. A unicameral parliamentary system would facilitate the passage of government legislation, as bills could no longer be blocked by the Senate (the upper house), but an overhaul of the entrenched political system is largely implausible. More broadly, any significant shift in the country's political culture will be extremely slow. The focus of foreign policy will probably remain on the South China Sea, as the long-running dispute with China simmers, and on the country's economic orientation, amid tensions in the region between China and the US.
Long-term performance: Although the demographic profile of the Philippines holds out the possibility of a stronger performance in the long-term forecast period, economic growth is likely to remain below potential in the absence of more rapid structural change. The high level of English-language skills will be of benefit, although this could become less valuable as others catch up, and the economy will also be able to absorb-gradually-more of its workforce. Proficiency in English should improve further in 2024-50, following the reintroduction of the language as the primary medium of instruction in secondary schools. Nevertheless, institutional obstacles to the formulation and implementation of far-sighted policies are likely to prevent a significant increase in the rate of gross fixed investment growth. Rising investment in infrastructure and manufacturing will be encouraging in the medium term but, in general, more rapid improvements will be achieved in neighbouring countries. Geopolitical tensions are a risk, emanating mainly from the South China Sea; these could hinder economic progress in the Philippines in the long term. The increasing probability of a conflict with China could deter investors from investing, despite improvements in the country's fundamentals

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The Philippines' geographical location renders it vulnerable to natural disasters. With the exception of the southern island group of Mindanao, most of the country is situated within the typhoon belt. This exposure has persistently depressed output in the agriculture sector, although this has more of an impact on the cost of living and employment than the country's economic growth, given the sector's relatively small size. Over the years, successive governments have also focused on policies to support the country's quick recovery from natural disasters and have invested in the development of relatively efficient early-warning systems. The Philippines is also extremely vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels. In March 2017 Congress unanimously ratified the Paris Climate Agreement. The country then went on to set its intended nationally determined contribution (NDC) later that year, setting a target of reducing carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 relative to a "business as usual" scenario. This target was raised to 75% in April 2021 (although 72% of the target applies only if the Philippines receive sufficient financial and technological aid from developed countries, which has not happened so far and remains a very remote possibility in the foreseeable future.) The country has also yet to come out with a net-zero target. It is unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its 2030 goals.
Technological developments Over the long term, the Philippines will have to play catch-up with technological advancements elsewhere. The country has consistently spent less than 1% of its GDP on research and development, while its schools have proved unable to produce qualified specialists in innovative technology. Its large business-process outsourcing (BPO) sector will face greater competition from automation amid rising wages. Artificial intelligence also threatens to disrupt service sector jobs, including in customer services, in which the Philippines specialises. Moving up the value chain in services will be crucial, and BPO operators have already begun to adapt by offering higher-skilled services. Successive governments have initiated small steps towards reorienting its economy to more sophisticated industries. It will take years, and related advances in the country's business environment and digital infrastructure, for the benefits of such measures to materialise.
Migration and urbanisation In 2022 nearly 48% of the population resided in urban areas, bringing it almost on a par with Thailand but still behind Indonesia. A significant percentage of its population still resides in rural areas. The UN Human Settlements Programme estimates that 84% of Filipinos will reside in urban areas by 2050. Philippine cities are facing major demographic, environmental, economic, social and spatial challenges. Many cities, including Metro Manila, face issues related to poor transport infrastructure, a lack of proper housing, urban sprawl and the impact of natural and man-made disasters. The Philippines will remain one of the foremost countries of origin for migrant workers, with a substantial flow of people into the Middle East and Asia. Unskilled workers will continue to make up a large section of this group.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - After a string of political crises in recent years, Italy's political stability outlook has improved substantially since the right-wing coalition, led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI), won an absolute majority (about 60% of the parliamentary seats) at the general election in late September 2022. It was the first time since 2008 that an election had delivered a clear majority for a political bloc. This will continue to allow the government to easily pass legislation in parliament throughout its term without much obstacle. With its strong populist tendencies, the government is instinctively wary of liberalisation and reforms aimed at creating a level playing field among businesses, encouraging innovation or boosting productivity.

- EIU expects a small improvement in Italy's business environment score during the forecast period (2024-28). However, the country falls by four places in the global ranking and by one place to second from bottom, ahead of just Turkey in western Europe, in the regional ranking. Score improvements have resulted in rises in Italy's global rankings for the macroeconomic environment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and technological readiness. Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, policy towards private enterprise and competition, taxes, and the labour market. Reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact. Despite various past reforms, we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment, and evasion to remain widespread.

- Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU after Germany and France, and the eighth largest globally. GDP per head is below the euro zone average. Italy's public finances will remain among the least healthy in the EU, and debt stabilisation will be a major cause of concern for investors. Italy will continue to post the strongest post-pandemic rebound among the EU's four biggest economies, owing to a recovery in households' purchasing power and foreign demand in 2024. However, comprehensive reforms in areas that are crucial to addressing the country's structural weaknesses and enhancing its growth potential-such as taxation, reducing inequalities, pensions and competition-are unlikely.

- The population grew at an annual average rate of 0.4% in 1999-2015. Since 2016 the population has begun to decline, falling from 60m in 2017 to 58.99m in 2023, according to the UN's population estimates. We expect the population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 58m in 2028, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows. Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) was an estimated 39% in 2023, already the highest in the EU, and is predicted to reach 44% by 2028. This trend, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly.

- Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 55% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

- Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average 0.7% per year in 2024-50 (the long-term forecast period). A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. From 1996 to 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S). Following the 2018 election, M5S and the right-wing Lega formed a government led by Giuseppe Conte, but it was unstable and undermined Italy's relations with the EU. In an agreement to avert a snap election in late 2019, M5S and the pro-European centre-left Partito Democratico formed a new government, also led by Mr Conte. After a government crisis in early 2021, Mario Draghi, an independent and a former European Central Bank president, was appointed prime minister in February, receiving broad support. The Draghi government collapsed eight months before the end of the parliamentary term, in July 2022. A right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia won a comfortable parliamentary majority at the general election in September 2022.
Political structure: Parliament, comprising two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis, the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government.
Policy issues: The economic investment plan drafted by the Draghi government and approved by the EU will dominate the legislative agenda in 2024-28, given the vast sums of EU money on offer (about EUR200bn in grants and loans).
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation-tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes, including the regional business tax (IRAP), are levied to fund healthcare services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.9%. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$645.6bn in 2023 and imports (fob) at US$600.7bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$12.3bn, or 0.5% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance After a string of inconclusive elections and political crises in recent years, the September 2022 general election yielded a comfortable parliamentary majority for a right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI), also comprising the right-wing Lega and the centre-right Forza Italia (FI). The right-wing bloc won a combined vote share of about 44% but failed to secure two-thirds of the seats, which would have allowed the executive to change the constitution without a referendum, potentially overcoming most checks and balances on power. The FdI obtained about 26% of the vote, up from just 4% at the March 2018 general election. Support for Matteo Salvini's Lega dropped sharply to 8.8%, down from 17.4% in 2018. FI, previously led by the late Silvio Berlusconi, secured 8% of the vote, down from 14% in 2018. The centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) won 19% of the vote, broadly in line with 2018 (18.8%). The populist Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) won 15% of the vote, down sharply from about 33% in 2018, while the centrist alliance comprising Azione and Italia Viva-a splinter party of the PD formed by a former PD leader and prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in late 2019-secured 7.8% of the vote. In October Italy's new government, the most right-wing since the end of the second world war and led by the country's first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was sworn in before the president, Sergio Mattarella.

Political outlook: Political stability EIU expects the government to remain in power for its full five-year term until 2027. A strong showing for Ms Meloni's far-right FdI at the European Parliament election on June 8th-9th has raised her profile in the EU, reducing the risk of a political crisis in Italy and the prospect of a snap general election.
After a string of political crises in recent years, Italy's political stability outlook has improved substantially since the right-wing coalition, led by the FdI, won an absolute majority (about 60% of the parliamentary seats) at the general election in late September 2022. It was the first time since 2008 that an election had delivered a clear majority for a political bloc. This will continue to allow the government to easily pass legislation in parliament throughout its term without much obstacle.
The Meloni government will continue to benefit from the fragmentation of the opposition and the disarray in the largest of these forces, the centre-left PD, which elected a new left-wing leader, Elly Schlein, in March 2023. The M5S has not been particularly effective in working with other opposition forces to mount a serious challenge to the Meloni government.
There is a risk that investors' concerns about Italy's worsening economic growth outlook, the country's fragile public finances and the direction of economic policy will resurface in 2024-25. There is a risk that divergences over spending priorities amid the need to consolidate the public finances in 2025 will become a source of friction among the coalition partners.
Snap elections are common in Italy (the country has had 68 governments in 76 years), but there is a low risk of an immediate one. The FdI won the largest share of the vote but relies on the far-right Lega and the centre-right FI to govern. This could become a source of instability over time. However, given strong support for Ms Meloni's FdI in opinion polls and the lack of incentives for the FdI's coalition partners to pull out (given that a different parliamentary majority is not possible and opinion polls are showing that an early election would deliver a similar distribution of seats in parliament), the risk is low at present.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Italy has been mostly governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system, all bills must be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. The number of members of parliament was reduced to 400 in the Chamber of Deputies and 200 in the Senate before the 2022 election, but further much-needed institutional reform is unlikely.
Constitutional reforms will remain a priority for the Meloni government A constitutional reform to enhance the powers of the prime minister will continue to be a priority for Ms Meloni. The Meloni government has put forward two major reforms--the direct election of the prime minister and the devolution of power to Italy's regional authorities. However, institutional reform is hard to achieve. Multiple readings and a two-thirds majority in parliament or a simple majority followed by a referendum are required to change the constitution. We continue to believe that a coherent overhaul of Italy's institutions to improve political stability and government effectiveness is unlikely during the current parliamentary term.
Red tape is likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. Modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to gradually speed up some bureaucratic procedures. However, given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 has been slow. Attempts by previous governments to reduce bureaucratic procedures have been largely unsuccessful, and Italy still has among the highest levels of red tape in Europe.
Italy's notoriously slow justice system will improve only gradually in 2024-28 With two levels of appeal in some cases, a shortage of judges and prosecutors, and a backlog of cases, Italy has one of the slowest justice systems in the EU: the average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute is more than double that in some other member states. Other major issues that make effective reform challenging include the politicisation of the judiciary, with the Italian National Association of Judges (ANM) divided between left- and right-wing factions; perceived interference or pressure on judges and prosecutors from the government and politicians; a lack of specialisation among judges; and the fragmentation of the court system.
In early July parliament approved a reform of the justice system proposed by Carlo Nordio, the justice minister of the Meloni government. The government expects the reforms to speed up the slow justice system, but the overriding objective of the bill's raft of measures is to strengthen defendants' rights and curb the powers of judges and public prosecutors. Curbing the powers of Italy's judges and public prosecutors was a goal that inspired judicial reforms introduced by successive centre-right governments led by the late Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister (1994-95, 2001-06 and 2008-11). These frequently drew stern criticism from organisations such as the ANM. We expect the backlog of cases to reduce, and court proceedings to speed up in 2024-28, with stricter statutes of limitation for criminal prosecutions, but only gradually. Tensions between the government and the judiciary are likely to increase.
The abolition of the crime of abuse of office could increase corruption among officials The justice reform package includes the abolition of the crime of abuse of office by public officials; tighter restrictions on the use of wiretaps in trials; the elimination of the public prosecutor's right to appeal an acquittal in cases involving less serious offences; and a requirement that three (not just one) judges must make precautionary custody rulings, although this measure will not come into effect for two years (because of a shortage of judges). According to the European Commission, the proposed changes to the regulations on crimes against the public administration would decriminalise forms of corruption and could have a negative impact on the fight against corruption, which is a major problem in Italy.
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of scandals revealed in recent years. The M5S-Lega government passed anti-corruption legislation in 2018, imposing harsher criminal penalties and public-office bans for graft, and from 2020 applying the statute of limitations only to first-instance trials so that fewer cases are dismissed owing to a lengthy appeals process. The government of Mario Draghi (2021-22) introduced new anti-corruption responsibilities for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which will be in charge of preventing fraud and monitoring conflicts of interest. Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury, and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch The next national parliamentary election is not due until late 2027. On June 8th-9th Italy held its European Parliament election, combined with the first round of local and regional elections in many parts of the country. In the European Parliament election, Ms Meloni emerged as the main winner. Her far-right FdI, which is in the soft-Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament, obtained 28.8% of the vote (24 of Italy's 76 seats in the EU assembly), up from 26% at the general election held in September 2022. The FdI's junior coalition partners, the Lega and FI, obtained 9% (eight seats) and 9.6% of the vote (nine seats) respectively, compared with 8.8% and 8.1% in 2022. Reflecting their divergent positions on major European policy issues such as support for Ukraine, the Lega and FI are affiliated to separate European political groups: the Lega to the hard-right Identity and Democracy (ID) and FI to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the largest group in the European Parliament.
Of the opposition parties, the PD, which is in the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the second-largest group in the European Parliament, also performed strongly, winning 24.1% of the vote (21 seats), while the Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra (AVS) obtained a respectable 6.8% (six seats, two for the Green group in the European Parliament and four for The Left), and the Südtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) of the South Tirol autonomous region, which is in the EPP, won 0.6% (one seat).
The PD made significant gains in the local elections in many parts of the country in early June. The centre-left's positive performance in the local polls shows that if the PD forms broad alliances with other parties on the left and centre it can challenge Ms Meloni's ruling coalition, but such alliances are currently unlikely at the national level.
Political outlook: International relations Italy's foreign policy will remain focused on its traditional priorities, namely European and transatlantic co-operation. As public opinion in Italy is firmly pro-EU, we believe that the FdI-led government will continue to suppress most of its past Euroscepticism (in the 2018 electoral campaign the FdI advocated renegotiating all EU treaties, including the euro, and the Lega favoured leaving the euro zone). However, tensions with Italy's EU partners are likely to reappear, given the strong populist tendencies of all three parties in the right-wing ruling coalition. Besides the Ukraine crisis, numerous issues, including immigration and fiscal policy, could cause relations between the right-wing government and Italy's EU partners to deteriorate sharply.
The government will maintain Italy's support for Ukraine against Russia. Since taking office Ms Meloni has been keen to bolster her international credentials with Italy's pro-Ukraine Western allies. However, her coalition partners do not all share her view of Russia's invasion. A change of leadership in the US after the 2024 presidential election or a decline in public support for Ukraine in Italy could lead to a shift in her government's position on the Russian invasion and her commitment to continue to supply aid, including weapons, to Ukraine.
We expect the Meloni government to retain a relatively distanced relationship with China, while remaining cautious of undermining bilateral economic ties with one of Italy's most important trading partners. Ms Meloni's upcoming visit to China in late July underlines the delicate balance that Italy is trying to strike: de-risking from China in line with Europe's more muscular economic security strategy, while maintaining a "strategic partnership" with one of its most important trading partners. Ms Meloni's trip comes less than a year after Italy formally withdrew from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), membership of which she had previously described as "a serious mistake". Although relations have cooled since Italy's exit from the BRI, China remains an important market for Italian pharmaceuticals, luxury and textile products, cars and industrial goods. Although Italy has supported the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, we expect the Italian government to move cautiously, to mitigate any potential Chinese retaliation against Italian industry. In fact, the government is courting some Chinese carmakers to set up manufacturing in Italy. These efforts will focus on encouraging local manufacturing, in order to support Italian employment and economic activity; Ms Meloni had previously criticised a deal between Stellantis (a US-French-Italian auto manufacturer) and Leapmotor (China) to sell Chinese cars in Europe from September 2024, given that assembly would occur in Poland.

Overview: EIU expects a small improvement in Italy's business environment score during the forecast period (2024-28). However, the country falls by four places in the global ranking and by one place to second from bottom, ahead of just Turkey in western Europe, in the regional ranking.
Strengths: Score improvements have resulted in rises in Italy's global rankings for the macroeconomic environment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and technological readiness. Several of the improvements reflect the impact of modest economic reforms by successive governments since late 2011 and the implementation of some of the reforms and investments contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP). The plan gives the government access to substantial financial support from the EU.
Weaknesses: Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, policy towards private enterprise and competition, taxes, and the labour market. Previous reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact. Implementation of the NRRP will remain challenging as a result of weak administrative capacity, especially at the local government level.
What to watch
- The current government is phasing in wide-ranging changes to the tax system, but we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment and constrain efforts to improve the country's public finances. Evasion will remain widespread, despite past efforts to improve compliance.
- Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets has made progress. Nevertheless, resistance to consolidation in the sector is likely to continue.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The ruling coalition has strong populist tendencies and is sceptical about measures to enhance competition.
2026-28: Improvement in competition policy is unlikely, but ad hoc interventions in sectors that the coalition parties consider politically favourable are possible.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Modest reductions in red tape. Government imposes penalties on foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2026-28: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Pressure on export sector from supply-chain and trade shocks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine moderates.
2026-28: Recognition of risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market encourages trade diversification.
Taxes 2024-25: Personal and corporate tax reform plans of the government led by Giorgia Meloni will be difficult to implement. Several banks opt out of payment of a one-off levy on additional bank profits earned in 2023 (0.1% of their assets).
2026-28: If implemented, 15% global minimum corporate tax rate to replace "digital tax" on foreign multinational firms.
Financing 2024-25: After raising interest rates sharply in 2022-23 to curb inflation, the European Central Bank will gradually loosen monetary policy.
2026-28: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign persists. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market 2024-25: Citizens' income abolished in 2024, replaced by new anti-poverty scheme; pension reforms partly reinstated.
2026-28: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Bureaucratic obstacles constrain government plans for higher investment spending. Increased investment in energy infrastructure to boost security and diversification of supply.
2026-28: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keeps research and development (R&D) spending low.
2026-28: Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Overview: Italy's macroeconomic environment score and rankings improve in the forecast period, reflecting slowing inflation and a narrowing of the budget deficit. However, the government still faces major macroeconomic policy challenges, including supporting investment and employment, raising productivity, putting public debt on a sustainable downward path, and making policies more socially inclusive. Monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2022-23 to combat the surge in inflation caused government bond yields to rise and risk premiums to widen, pushing up government borrowing costs. The start of an easing cycle in June 2024 should help gradually to reduce interest payments on Italy's government debt during the forecast period.
Strengths: Measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are planned under Italy's NRRP, but implementation is likely to remain a challenge. The ECB has instruments at its disposal to avoid a further sharp rise in financial fragmentation risk in the euro area. We expect the bank to intervene, if necessary, to help to contain a further rise in government borrowing costs for heavily indebted countries such as Italy.
Weaknesses: Despite some progress in recent years, economic reforms have generally been introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and implementation has remained an issue. Although the deficit is expected to narrow during the forecast period, it is still large, and Italy's government debt to GDP ratio remains one of the highest in the euro area.
What to watch
- The size of the country's public debt and its record of weak government effectiveness will continue to be causes of concern for Italy's EU partners, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector. Room for manoeuvre will be limited in the 2025 budget following the European Commission's recommendation to open excessive-deficit procedures against Italy and several other EU countries.
- Despite some delays, as at end-2023 Italy had already received EUR102bn from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) out of a total EUR194.4bn (EUR71.8bn in grants and EUR122.6bn in loans). At the time of writing the Commission was assessing Italy's application for a fifth tranche worth almost EUR11bn. The remainder of the funds are due to be drawn down in five more tranches under a tight timeframe, with all "milestones" (qualitative objectives) and "targets" (quantitative goals) having to be completed by August 2026.

Overview: Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and the justice system. Political pressure has generally limited the effectiveness of Italy's regulatory bodies. EU directives have generally been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy, transport and professional services. Italy's current right-wing government has indicated that it will reduce the state's stakes in a range of companies, including the post office, Poste Italiane; the energy group Eni (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi); and the state railway company. However, the sales are designed to generate revenue to reduce government debt rather than boost competition in the affected sectors.
Strengths: In 2021 the previous government, led by Mario Draghi, a former governor of the Bank of Italy (the central bank) and president of the ECB, introduced new out-of-court procedures for business restructuring. This should help to accelerate the process, with the courts intervening only in the event of a failure to reach an agreement between the debtor and creditors.
Weaknesses: Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent to foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases were introduced in the previous parliament. However, political opposition and resistance to change remain strong in the judicial system, which is likely to hamper implementation. Implementation is also likely to be an issue without an overhaul of the public administration. As with past reform plans, aspects of the 2022 competition bill faced strong opposition within some political circles and business associations. Following the collapse of the Draghi government, the bill was diluted. The new bankruptcy code adopted in early 2019 represents a major improvement, but it only came into force in part in mid-July 2022, with safeguarding procedures delayed until end-2023.
What to watch
- Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the state-owned development bank, already has sizeable stakes in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates Eni and Enel; Italy's electricity transmission company, Terna; the shipbuilder Fincantieri; and Poste Italiane. We expect CDP's role in the economy to expand further, as it is increasingly being used to rescue struggling Italian firms and represent the state's interests in companies deemed to be of "strategic" importance. However, its efforts since the beginning of 2023 to reach a deal with Italy's TIM, which is majority owned by Vivendi, a French telecoms group, to buy the former state company's fixed-line network have so far failed.
- An agreement reached between the European Commission and the Italian government in 2021 allowed a new company, Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA Airways), to be carved out of Italy's loss-making national carrier, the formerly state-owned Alitalia, after more than four years in administration. However, since then the Italian airline and its minority shareholder, Lufthansa, have been embroiled in an EU state aid case brought by a rival budget airline, Ryanair. At present, it appears that an agreement will be reached to drop the case in exchange for ITA relinquishing some of its slots at Milan's Linate airport. This will increase competition on long- and short-haul flights at the airport, where ITA is the dominant airline.

Overview: Italy's score and rankings for policy towards foreign investment deteriorate in the forecast period. FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. Hardening sentiment at the EU level towards foreign takeovers and non-EU inward FDI-with a particular focus on inflows from China-has resulted in tighter regional screening provisions since 2017. On the back of deteriorating EU-China political relations, the Meloni government announced in late 2023 that Italy would withdraw from the 2019 Memorandum of Understanding with China to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative-China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan-when it came up for renewal in 2024.
Strengths: The main strength of Italy's business sector has been its many family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies, which specialise in products that require high-quality design and engineering as well as luxury and high-end goods.
Weaknesses: The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to its bureaucratic and legal complexities, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Past labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and the streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues. However, given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU countries.
What to watch
- The impact of the Ukraine crisis and Gaza conflict on international trade and the prices of energy and other commodities, as well as higher interest rates compared with historical averages, will weigh heavily on firms' balance sheets and equity valuations. This is likely to renew foreign interest in acquisitions of Italian companies.
- The current right-wing government's populist tendencies are likely to make Italy less open to foreign investment, especially in sectors that it considers "strategic", such as energy and telecoms.

Overview: Italy's score in this category improves in the forecast period, leading to substantial improvements in its global and regional rankings. The improvement reflects our expectation of a moderation of the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis on global trade and supply-chains, to which Italy has been particularly vulnerable. The country's foreign trade regime is largely defined by its EU membership. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU; most non-tariff restrictions have been abolished; and administrative costs related to cross-border trade are low. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). All of these arrangements exclude agriculture. Trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties, with bilateral and regional agreements providing for lower or zero tariffs, as well as co-operation on non tariff barriers. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market, particularly China, will encourage greater trade diversification.
Strengths: The EU remains committed to the WTO and its dispute arbitration procedures. As support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed the EU has shifted its focus towards negotiating bilateral trade deals. These include agreements with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and New Zealand, an upgrade of its deal with Mexico, and the launch of trade talks with Indonesia. However, after five years of negotiations with Australia, talks collapsed over terms of access to the EU agricultural market in October 2023.
Weaknesses: The global trade environment has deteriorated as a result of protectionist sentiment and a moderate slowdown of world trade growth. An as yet unresolved appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body since late 2019 has undermined the effectiveness of the multilateral trade system.
What to watch
- On the assumption that Joe Biden wins the US presidential election in November 2024, trade relations between Europe and the US are likely to remain unchanged. However, big shifts on trade policy would be likely under Donald Trump. The Republican front-runner has said that he will impose a 10% tariff on all imports-compared with average tariffs of less than 3% on EU imports at present. Although imposing such a blanket tariff would face congressional hurdles, there could be a rise in tariffs targeting some particular sectors. These could include tariffs on automotive imports, which Mr Trump backed away from in 2019, but may want to revive. The other big risk is that the US decides not to agree to or implement the OECD global tax deal, gets hit by the EU digital services tax (as these have been put on hold while this deal is finalised) and chooses to retaliate with a new array of tariffs.
- If fully implemented, the provisional EU trade agreement with Mercosur, the South American trading bloc, following 20 years of talks would create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people. However, owing to opposition in some EU member states to aspects of the deal (mostly related to agriculture and climate), the ratification process has stalled, and we do not expect it to be completed in the forecast period.

Overview: Italy's low score for taxation remains unchanged in the forecast period, resulting in falls in the country's global and regional ranking. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, we expect the tax system to remain complex, making compliance costly and time-consuming for private-sector companies. Despite a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017, Italy's standard rate of corporate tax is relatively high, at 24%. In 2020 the government introduced a 3% "digital services tax" on multinational companies. This tax was replaced in 2024 by the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed in 2021. According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue as a share of GDP (including social-security contributions) stood at 42.5% in 2023, broadly unchanged compared with the previous three years. The euro zone average in 2022 (latest available data) was 41.9%, according to Eurostat, unchanged from 2021.
Strengths: Given the extent of tax evasion and avoidance there is plenty of scope in Italy to widen the tax base, close the tax gap (between potential and actual revenue), and shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour. According to Eurostat, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base for low-wage earners), at 43.5% in 2022, compared with the euro zone average of 38.4%. At 16% in 2022, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU.
Weaknesses: The tax system is complex, varies across regions and goes through frequent changes. Tax evasion and avoidance remains widespread in Italy, having been encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, the limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. In addition to Italy's high corporation tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Company social-security contribution rates are also high by international comparison, at up to 30% (about 9% for employees, down from about 9.5% as a result of measures adopted in the 2024 budget). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest rates in Europe), is significantly reduced. For the 2022 tax year the number of personal income-tax brackets was cut from five to four. In 2024 the number was cut to just three, with a view to eventually extending the flat-tax regime available to the self-employed to employees. The marginal personal income-tax rate has been kept at 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR50,000 (EUR75,000 up to 2021).
What to watch
- The personal income tax changes in the 2024 budget, which benefited low-earners, were only funded for one year. If they are to remain in place in 2025 and beyond, additional savings will be needed from spending cuts or other tax increases. The government's room for manoeuvre in the 2025 budget will be extremely limited.
- The NRRP contains measures to improve the tax administration, simplify the tax system and reduce evasion, but implementing such reforms will be challenging. We expect the tax burden to remain high owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements.

Overview: Italy's score improves in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation in the banking sector, support recapitalisation, and tackle the issue of high non-performing loans (NPLs) accumulated following the global and euro zone sovereign debt crises. NPLs have declined considerably. At 2.7% of total credit at the end of the first quarter of 2024 the ratio is well below the peak of 18.2% in 2015, but still above the EU average of just under 2%. A system of guarantees (the garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) introduced in 2016 contributed significantly to the decline and the emergence of a secondary market for NPLs. The scheme expired in July 2022, after several extensions approved by the European Commission. However, since taking office in late 2022, the Meloni government has shown at times limited awareness of the potentially negative effects of its policies on the financial system. In late 2023 financial market fallout forced the government to backtrack on a planned one-off additional tax of 40% on banks' extra profits earned from higher interest rates. The government also came in for widespread criticism over measures also announced in late 2023 to allow households and small businesses to buy back NPLs at a discounted price to improve their creditworthiness. The Financial Stability Board and the ECB have both warned that the measures risk undermining the functioning of the NPL market. Italy's large number of small and medium-sized firms continue to rely heavily on bank borrowing for financing.
Strengths: The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2023 included eight Italian banks: Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), Banco BPM, Mediobanca, BPER, Iccrea Banca (Istituto Centrale del Credito Cooperativo) and Cassa Centrale Banca-Credito Cooperativo Italiano. Under the adverse scenario, the most severe in recent rounds of testing, Italian banks performed better on average than those in the EU, with a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5% by 2025, a fall of 351 basis points from end-2022. In the EU as a whole the fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 10.4% in 2025, a fall of 459 basis points. MPS, which was the worst-performing bank in the bloc in the 2021 stress tests, showed a marked improvement, with its fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio falling by 551 basis points to a still-solid 10.1% in 2025.
Weaknesses: Progress towards consolidation in the sector has been slow, but the successful takeover in 2020 of UBI Banca, Italy's sixth-largest bank, by Intesa Sanpaolo, the second largest, suggests that a new wave of bank mergers and acquisitions is likely during the forecast period. However, government efforts to encourage one of Italy's main banks to take over its stake in MPS have so far been unsuccessful. Having rescued MPS, Italy's fifth-largest bank at the time, at a cost of EUR5.4bn in late 2016 when it came close to collapse, the Italian state has injected further capital while the bank's new management implements a fresh restructuring plan before trying again to sell the bank.
What to watch
- The resilience of the financial sector will be tested by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, followed by the cost-of-living and energy crises. An array of support policies at the disposal of the ECB, as well as domestic stimulus measures by the government and the Bank of Italy, has helped to bolster liquidity and hold down banks' funding costs.
- A renewed increase in loan losses amid higher unemployment and business failures and bouts of global financial market volatility could put pressure on individual lenders' balance sheets, potentially exposing areas of weakness and curbing lending as the economic recovery slows.

Overview: Italy's global ranking deteriorates by five places in the forecast period, as we expect the country to continue to perform poorly in the labour market category, especially compared with its EU peers. In May 2023 the Italian government approved a decree law including measures to increase labour market flexibility, with a moderate easing of restrictions on fixed-term contracts; reduce labour taxes; improve active labour policies; and change social-welfare benefits to incentivise people who are out of work to seek employment. However, the measures are limited so are unlikely to have any lasting positive impact on Italy's labour market performance. The high level of pension spending in Italy will keep social-security contributions high, curbing employment growth.
Strengths: Labour market reform is a major component of Italy's NRRP. However, rather than focus on contracts, as past reforms have largely done, it will seek to improve job activation schemes, as well as the retraining and upskilling of workers, increasing the effectiveness of the national employment agency, and improving education outcomes.
Weaknesses: The shortcomings that persist in the Italian labour market leave it particularly vulnerable to severe economic and social disruption in the event of another economic downturn. Despite the gap narrowing, Italy's headline jobless rate remains above the euro area average. Youth unemployment also remains particularly high at about 20%, the fifth highest in the euro area. Italian labour market participation also remains low, particularly among women and young people, and fell sharply during the pandemic. Italy's employment rate was 66.3% in 2023, above its pre-pandemic average of 63.5% in 2019 but well below the euro area average of 74.7%. The female employment rate averaged 56.5% in Italy (69.8% in the euro area).
What to watch
- We expect sectoral wage bargaining between unions and employers' associations at the national level to continue to determine wage levels and employment conditions. Negotiations can be protracted, however, resulting in many contracts expiring well before they can be renewed, contributing to industrial unrest.
- The social partners agreed in 2018 to implement second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains, but progress in this area was halted during the pandemic, and such plans will face resistance.

Overview: As reflected in Italy's relatively low score in this category and its decline in the global and regional rankings, the quality of its infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment over the past 25-30 years, and corruption investigations and opposition from local interest groups have been a relatively common reason for blocking or delaying several major projects. Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in the transport and energy sectors, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.
Strengths: Backed by EU recovery funds, Italy's NRRP focuses on a wide range of infrastructure investments in areas such as sustainable energy and transport, as well as in the digital economy, including the deployment of ultra-fast broadband, and 5G and satellite technology. It remains to be seen how effective implementation and monitoring of the investments will be during the forecast period. The collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in 2018 highlighted the urgent need for maintenance of existing infrastructure. However, the reconstruction of the bridge in record time (it reopened in July 2020) highlights that when there is political will to overcome bureaucratic obstacles there is ample scope for improvement in Italy's performance.
Weaknesses: Successive governments have promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt-servicing costs, combined with competing demands within coalition governments, have made a radical change in policy direction difficult. Limited domestic energy sources, popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation and the Ukraine crisis will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor energy distribution infrastructure will also keep upward pressure on costs in the medium term. Investment projects in the sector are also likely to continue to face strong local resistance.
What to watch
- Building a high-speed broadband network across the country has been a policy priority of successive Italian governments. Progress has been extremely slow so far, but the NRRP's focus on the need to accelerate Italy's digital transition may provide some much-needed momentum.
- Central to Italy's high-speed broadband investment plan has been a proposed merger of the network assets of Open Fiber, a wholesale broadband operator jointly owned by Enel and CDP, and TIM (formerly Telecom Italia), but resistance from TIM's largest shareholder, Vivendi, a French telecoms group, has been strong. The merger would help to speed the rollout and avoid unnecessary duplication. However, there is some concern that it would also stifle competition.

Overview: Italy's technological readiness score and rankings improve in the forecast period, partly driven by measures contained in the NRRP, including digitalisation of public services. During the pandemic, growth in e-commerce accelerated, to 34.8% year on year in value terms in 2020, moderating to 13.4% in 2021, 6.4% in 2022, 4.7% in 2023 and 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024, according to Istat. However, this was from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales in 2019 (compared with about 20% in the UK). According to the European Patent Office, after declining by about 1% in 2022, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy rose by 3.8% in 2023-compared with an annual average increase of 1.8% in Europe as a whole-but accounted for only 5.9% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at 85.3 per 1m population, ranking Italy 18th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany and France, but almost on a par with the UK and well ahead of Spain.
Strengths: Mobile-phone penetration is among the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive.
Weaknesses: Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D), has risen gradually since the beginning of the 2000s but is low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. Total R&D spending was the equivalent of just under 1.5% of GDP in 2021, according to the OECD, compared with an OECD average of 2.7%. Italy ranks as a "moderate innovator" in the European Innovation Scoreboard 2023. Its performance relative to the EU has improved since 2016, but its score declined sharply in 2023 from 2022.
What to watch
- We expect a slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base.
- Italy's NRRP has earmarked total EU funds of about EUR21bn for investments in research and innovation to be spent by late 2026. The projects focus mainly on enhancing research structures with the creation of national research centres; improving researchers' skills, particularly in the fields of digital technologies and ecological transition; and facilitating more collaboration between businesses and universities.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), drafted by the previous government, will remain its main economic policy anchor, given the vast sums of money on offer (about EUR200bn in grants and loans for 2021-26) from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. The implementation of structural reforms and investment plans agreed with the EU will remain patchy but sufficient to continue receiving recovery fund disbursements. With its strong right-wing populist tendencies, the government is instinctively wary of liberalisation and reforms aimed at creating a level playing field among businesses, encouraging innovation or boosting productivity. Comprehensive reforms in areas that are crucial to addressing the country's structural weaknesses and enhancing its growth potential-such as taxation, reducing inequalities, pensions and competition-are unlikely.
In terms of taxation, in March the Meloni government approved a new tax reform bill that includes tax cuts and a less redistributive tax framework. Measures include a reduction in the number of personal income-tax rates from four to three, with the objective over the medium term to move to a single flat rate by 2027; a reduction in the corporation-tax rate, currently 24%, for companies that invest and create employment; the gradual elimination of the unpopular regional business tax; streamlining of the system of tax-deductible expenses; and lower value-added tax (VAT) rates on essential goods.
With regard to pensions, the Meloni government chose not to address the structural flaws in the pension system but decided to tinker with the eligibility criteria by introducing the so-called quota 103 (62 years of age with 41 years of contributions, compared with the statutory minimum pension age of 67 with at least 20 years of contributions) in order to ensure flexibility for those seeking to retire early. A shrinking population, combined with rising life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending is already among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP, despite repeated reforms since the early 1990s.

Government debt 137.1 138.1 139.5 139.7 139.7 139.8
Italy's public finances will remain among the most precarious in the EU. The general government deficit narrowed to 7.4% of GDP in 2023, well above recent government projections of 5.3%. The overshoot was largely attributable to difficulties in dealing with the unwinding of generous construction subsidies (the so-called superbonus). The size of the slippage raises concerns about the ability of Italy's relatively inexperienced right-wing coalition government to get to grips with the challenge of putting the public finances on a firmer footing once the EU's new fiscal rules kick in in 2025. This could fuel uncertainty in the sovereign debt market, pushing up government borrowing costs further. With interest payments forecast to rise from 3.8% of GDP in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024 and 4% in 2025, the government will have limited leeway for promised tax cuts and spending increases in the 2024 budget. EIU expects the budget deficit to narrow as a share of GDP in 2024 but remain among the widest in the euro zone, at 5.2%.
We forecast that the budget deficit will narrow gradually to 3.2% of GDP in 2028, remaining above the 3% EU reference target. The public debt/GDP ratio (net of EU aid)-which at 137.1% at end-2023 was the second highest in the euro zone after Greece-will increase marginally over our forecast period, coming to about 140% at end-2028. In late June the European Commission announced that it intended to launch excessive-deficit procedures (EDPs) against seven EU countries, including Italy, for breaching the bloc's fiscal rules (ie the 3% of GDP fiscal deficit threshold, or a government debt ratio of above 60% of GDP that is not diminishing at a satisfactory pace). The Italian government will need to present a roadmap to the Commission by September 20th setting out how it aims to get the public accounts back in line with EU rules, and in theory could face fines if it does not submit a credible plan-although this has never happened in the past and it is unlikely to happen in the future, especially as we expect the government to show some willingness to co-operate.

Long-term interest rate (av) 4.3 3.8 3.7 3.5 3.5 3.5
At its latest monetary policy meeting, on June 6th, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its key policy rates by 25 basis points, after raising them by 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023. The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, admitted at the press conference that recent data were disappointing, but added that the disinflation process was "sufficiently advanced" to allow the bank to cut interest rates. She did not commit to a particular rate path after the June cut and reiterated that the bank would follow a "data-dependent" and "meeting by meeting" approach. However, bumpy disinflation in the euro zone means that ECB easing is likely to be very gradual. We expect the ECB to keep rates on hold in July and then cut its rates by another 50 basis points later in 2024 (25 basis points in both September and December), with the deposit rate falling from 3.75% currently to 3.25% at end-2024 and settling at about 2.3% in 2026-28 (well above the near-zero average in the 2010s).

Real GDP in Italy will grow by 1% in 2024, following a similar expansion in 2023-well above the average over the past 20 years (0.3%). A gradual increase in real wages as a result of a tight labour market and easing inflationary pressures should underpin a further 0.7% expansion in private consumption this year. EU-funded investment will also offset an expected contraction in real estate investment. Industrial output will continue to contract on an annual basis (albeit less severely than in 2023) but should pick up in the second half of the year, on the back of rising demand for Italian exports from euro zone partners such as Germany and from the US. A further expansion in economic activity will be prevented by still-tight monetary policy, with interest rates in the euro zone remaining at a record high until June, and the phase-out of subsidies in the construction sector.
In 2025-28 growth will remain above the pre-pandemic trend and potential growth (we expect the Italian economy to expand by 1% on average). This will be driven by steady growth in private consumption, helped by monetary easing in the euro zone from mid-2024, and EU-funded investment (especially in digital infrastructure and green technologies). EU-funded investment could deliver stronger economic growth in 2024-28, but we expect the implementation of structural reforms and investment plans agreed with the EU to remain patchy.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In 2023 industry (excluding construction) accounted for 24.3% of nominal gross value added, compared with 27.6% in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, increased trade frictions and protectionist tendencies in the context of the US-China rivalry. In 2023 manufacturing accounted for 16.6% of gross value added, down from 17.5% in 2007. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP-almost a quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat, which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services. Italy's automotive production, which is mainly geared towards exports, was badly affected by the pandemic and microchip crunch. We expect only a gradual recovery in sales and output over the forecast period as global automotive demand remains subdued in the short term. We expect the Italian automotive industry to see further rationalisation after FCA merged with its French counterpart PSA in early 2021 to form Stellantis. Electric-vehicle sales will pick up pace in 2024-28, supported by government incentives and improving charging infrastructure.
In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as a lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities. This has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation and research and development has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Activity in the construction sector accounted for 5.5% of gross value added in 2023, up from 4.6% on average in 2017-22. We expect the sector to perform relatively well in 2024-28 compared with recent years, mainly owing to construction-related economic stimulus measures introduced since the pandemic. The superbonus scheme allows homeowners a tax deduction of up to 110% (although it has been reduced to 70% since January 1st and 65% from 2025) on expenses related to property renovation. This can be used in conjunction with the "sismabonus" and "ecobonus" to reduce seismic risk and make energy-efficiency upgrades.
Accounting for about 74% of gross value added, the services sector will continue to rebound following covid-related disruptions. The retail sector also suffered in 2020-21. In contrast, the ICT sector has benefited from the increase in remote working, and we expect a continued rise in its share of real value added. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, that are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotive-Italy's main export sectors-should continue to perform well, despite production in some sectors increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are low.

We forecast that EU harmonised inflation will slow sharply to an average of 1.3% in 2024 (from 5.9% in 2023). The slowdown in inflation will be driven by a sharp drop in commodity prices, which will be only partly offset by still-strong nominal wage growth in Italy (which we expect to stand at 3.2% in 2024, down from an estimated 3.5% in 2023). We expect the ongoing increase in global shipping costs as a result of a flare-up of tensions in the Red Sea in early 2024 to be temporary. Inflation will then average 1.8% per year in 2025-28.

We expect the euro to depreciate slightly against the US dollar this year, to US$1.09:EUR1 at the end of 2024, from US$1.11:EUR1 at the end of 2023. Factors such as an improvement in the euro zone's terms of trade and overall economic outlook will continue to provide some support to the euro. However, growing interest-rate divergence between the ECB (which began its easing cycle in June) and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank, which we expect to begin in September), will put a lid on the euro appreciation vis-à-vis the dollar in the remainder of 2024. We expect a gradual appreciation in 2025-28, as a widening average current-account surplus will support the currency's value.

We forecast that the current account will register a surplus of 1.1% of GDP in 2024. This is due to an improvement in the trade balance, which will register a larger surplus owing to declining energy prices (Italy is heavily dependent on energy imports). We expect the current-account surplus to widen gradually in 2025-28, to 1.9% of GDP in 2028, driven by a larger trade surplus. It will nonetheless remain below its 2016-20 levels (3% of GDP on average); a rebound in domestic demand will keep import values high in historical terms, despite a gradual decline in import prices.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy Stocks and flows Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows contracted in 2020 to negative US$22bn, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, and remained negative in 2021 at US$30bn-with inward FDI positive at US$24.9 (1.2% of GDP)-before rebounding to US$15.9bn in 2022 and US$10.1bn in 2023. Inward FDI flows declined from US$62.7bn (3% of GDP) in 2022 to US$33.1bn (1.5% of GDP) in 2023, in line with a cyclical slowdown in GDP growth in Italy. Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$710bn in 2023, about 60% of total FDI in France, a third of that in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. As a share of GDP, the stock of FDI was 31.5% in 2023, lower than in every other EU country except Greece. FDI outflows have generally been small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy.
Origin and distribution FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2022, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from France (US$92.9bn), the US (US$43.7bn), Germany (US$40.7bn), the UK (US$27.5bn), the Netherlands (US$25.3bn), Switzerland (US$22.5bn) and Luxembourg (US$21.3bn), although FDI from the Netherlands and Luxembourg is likely to include investment originating elsewhere using these countries as a conduit.
Determinants The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$58,238 at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2023. Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted typical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, a low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-tech investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact According to the Italian Trade and Investment Agency (ITA), foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and a half times more in research and development than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central and northern Italy in GDP per head terms (at less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times that in the north.
Potential The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period (2024-28) will be hampered by the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. Over the forecast period a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's ongoing green transition, there could be potential for investment in the still-state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources. Political opposition to foreign ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature.

The population is projected to decline further Italy's population has been shrinking since 2015-to 58.9m in 2023, according to the UN's population estimates-and EIU expects it to decline further over the long term. This has been mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population, which has outpaced net immigration. In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic also put pressure on Italy's death and birth rates and immigrant arrivals. The number of births in Italy was the lowest recorded since the country's unification in 1861, and the death toll was the highest recorded in any year since the second world war. Net migration to Italy dropped significantly to about 88,000 in 2020, or about 1.4 per 1,000 residents-about half the rate of arrivals in 2019.
In 2023 Italy's total population dropped by 7,000 on annual basis (-0.1 per 1,000 inhabitants)-following a drop of 33,000 in 2022 and an average annual decline of 2.8 per 1,000 from 2014 to 2021. According to Istat, the national statistical agency, the birth rate was at an all-time low, with just 379,000 births in 2023, while deaths declined to 54,000 over the previous year (or a mortality rate of 11.2 per 1,000). Declining mortality resulted in improved life expectancy, which averaged 83.1 years in 2023, six months higher than in 2022. The fertility rate or average number of children per woman decreased from 1.24 in 2022 to 1.20 in 2023, approaching the all-time low level of 1.19 recorded in 1995. Italy's migration inflows recovered further in 2023, while emigration declined; the net balance was 274,000. We forecast that the population will fall over the long term, in line with falling birth rates and despite an expected increase in migration inflows.
According to Istat, the proportion of foreign residents in the total population increased from 4.5% in 2005 to 9% in 2024. As at January 2024 the foreign population was 5.3m, an increase of 3.2% compared with January 2023. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for more than 11% of the population at end-2023. The five largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians, Moroccans, Chinese and Ukrainians, which together account for about 50% of the total number of foreign residents.
Labour market reforms seek to increase labour mobility Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north-east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market. According to Istat, the employment rate rose to 61.5% in 2023, up by 1.3 percentage points on 2022, while remaining 15 percentage points lower than the EU average and the lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 will gradually address some of these issues during the forecast period (2024-28). In line with the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will shrink by 0.3%.
The rise in the proportion of the elderly will put pressure on pensions Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to those of working age) was an estimated 39% in 2023, already the highest in the EU, and it is predicted to reach 44% by 2028. This trend, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending is already among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP, despite repeated reforms since the early 1990s.
Risks to the fiscal sustainability of Italy's social security system have increased since a partial rollback in 2018 of a pension reform introduced in 2011. Changes to past reforms (including by the Meloni government) have tended to focus on broadening the possibility of early retirement, which the European Commission has warned might negatively affect labour supply in a context where Italy is already lagging the EU average for the participation of older workers in employment, thereby hampering potential growth and worsening the sustainability of public debt.

Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of about 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at an estimated US$58,238 in 2023. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 55% of that in the north. Development policies over the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 20%-just below the level in France, but significantly above that in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK (all at 16%). EIU expects it to decline only gradually during the forecast period (2024-28), largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low, but interest rates on consumer loans in 2024-28 will remain higher than in the pre-covid decade, which will keep the proportion of disposable income spent on debt-servicing high in historical terms. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock. Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to be introduced in order to meet budgetary targets.

Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor over the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's competitiveness substantially. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. This will hold back capital spending in the medium to long term. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration will be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population over the long-term forecast period (2024-50). EIU expects Italy's labour market participation rate to rise from the current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age. However, it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72%) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 1.2% in 2024-50.
External conditions: Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. Small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-tech sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D, innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic "Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short-lived. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition. In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. Without more drastic cuts, public spending on pensions will now rise again until late 2040. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government partly rolled back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which will lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high dropout rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth Long-term performance: Our baseline forecast is that Italian real GDP growth will average 0.7% per year in 2024-50. The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2023 fell from 107% of the EU average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change will have a moderate but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, especially among the country's growing elderly population. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such as citrus fruits and wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination and regional capital, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure.
Technological developments Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0" or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the internet of things, cloud technologies or "big data" analytics. The share rises sharply in firms with 250 or more employees, to about 47%, compared with 6% for firms with fewer than ten employees. In 2020 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.5% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile, in 2021 Italy's technology balance of payments reached an all-time high, with a surplus of EUR2.6bn (up from EUR1bn in 2020). Since 2016 a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, and higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Olaf Scholz of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) governs as chancellor at the head of the country's first three-party federal coalition, with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and The Greens. Germany has a strongly centrist and consensus-based political culture, and EIU expects the coalition to serve its full term, to October 2025. Policymaking has tended towards unwieldy compromises to satisfy the various coalition partners. However, compromise has become harder to achieve as these parties have seen their support erode, experienced disappointments at state elections and had their fiscal spending plans derailed by a court judgement. This means that frictions and divisions will increase in face of a weak economic outlook and as the 2025 election nears.

- Germany's score in our business environment model rises from 8.14 in the historical period (2019-23) to 8.31 in the forecast period (2024-28). The country climbs by two places to seventh in the global ranking, and ranks fourth among its regional peers, behind Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden. We expect gradual reform-led improvements in infrastructure, technological readiness and financing, but rising protectionism globally will result in a hardening of policy towards foreign investment and trade. Germany's main strengths are a stable political culture, openness to foreign trade and investment, and its research and innovation framework. Weaknesses include the tax regime, which places a heavy burden on labour income; a weak demographic outlook, elevating skilled labour shortages; and persistent red tape in certain sectors.

- Near-term economic prospects are gloomy, owing to weak investment sentiment and fiscal tightening. Growth in 2024 will be marginal, supported by monetary easing by the European Central Bank (ECB), and we do not expect a more substantial recovery in economic growth until later in the forecast period. Risks are tilted to the downside. Germany's trade- and export-oriented economy is highly exposed to rising global protectionist measures. The economy's large size and competitive advantage in high-value industrial goods will help it to weather external trade risks. However, more profound reforms are needed to improve domestic structural conditions, expand the labour pool, and finance investments in the green and digital transitions.

Population growth   0.4 0.1
Working-age population growth   -0.1 -0.8
Labour force growth   0.8 0.3

- The pandemic in 2020-21 resulted in a higher death rate, lower net immigration and slightly fewer births than in 2019. The arrival of more than 1m Ukrainian refugees after Russia invaded Ukraine raised the population to 84.7m by end-2023, but a period of demographic decline will nevertheless occur in the coming decades. As elsewhere in Europe, the population is ageing, elevating the old-age dependency ratio in the forecast period. The share of the population that is of working age in Germany dipped below that of Italy in 2018 and the UK in 2020, and is falling more swiftly than in any of the country's regional peers. This will increase pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems over the medium to long term, and exacerbate labour shortages.

- Germany is forecast to be the world's fourth-largest economy at market exchange rates in 2028, and is the biggest EU economy. It is the largest consumer market in Europe by population, but demand is constrained by a substantial tax wedge and high savings rates. Slowing inflation and rising real wages will support a strengthening of the retail sector, although households are more cautious than before the cost-of-living crisis about spending disposable income. Consumer demand for convenience will continue to rise, alongside demand for products that are sustainable; for ethnic, organic and local products; and for the expanding luxury segment. The share of online retail sales was boosted by the pandemic. An ageing demographic profile will increasingly shape demand.

Growth of real GDP per head 1.1 1.5 1.4
Growth of real GDP 1.1 1.2 1.2
Labour productivity growth 1.8 1.7 1.7

- Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate (2024-50) is 1.2%. The poor demographic outlook is the main driver of the weakening overall growth rate; total factor productivity will remain supportive of growth, as will capital spending. Long-term growth will be sustained by Germany's highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and openness to innovation. A more protectionist global trading order and geopolitical tensions with China will weigh on future German growth, but the huge international presence of German firms and investments will on balance support growth.

Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45) Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be removed only by the election of a successor. Federal coalitions are typically made up of two parties, but voter fragmentation was such in the 2021 election that the current government is the first three-party coalition at the federal level.
Policy issues: Priorities include reigniting a stagnating economy, while undertaking fiscal consolidation in the aftermath of a Federal Constitutional Court ruling limiting the use of off-balance-sheet investment funds. Spending pressures will continue to rise, however: the government has committed to higher defence spending (a special fund for which has been enshrined in the constitution); the energy transition will require a surge in public investment; the industrial sector is undergoing significant transformation; and the cost of health and social care for an ageing population will continue to rise. Investment spending will need to increase in the forecast period to meet these goals.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The solidarity tax was phased out for most income bands from 2021. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social-security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 20%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus came to US$245bn in 2023, in line with the historical trend. Germany's single largest goods export market is still the EU, but the country has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets. Trade with China, although significant, has fallen in recent years.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Germany is a federal democracy, with major powers delegated to the 16 states (Länder). The 2021 election marked a turning point for the political landscape as Angela Merkel stood down after 16 years as chancellor. Her party, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), performed poorly in the election, as voter preferences had fragmented and previously solid electoral blocs (such as the blue-collar vote) had dispersed.
As a result, for the first time, three parties were needed to reach a majority at the federal level, with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) ruling together with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and The Greens. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and far-left Left Party both lost vote share compared with 2017, but support for the AfD has since risen on the back of rising anti-immigration sentiment and a backlash against green policies. The bicameral parliament comprises the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), whose members are elected on a system of modified proportional representation, and the Bundesrat (the upper house), which consists of representatives of the 16 state governments. The coalition has a majority in the Bundestag, but not in the Bundesrat.

Political outlook: Political stability Germany has a strongly centrist and consensus-based political culture, and EIU expects the ruling coalition to serve a full term to October 2025, despite its substantial unpopularity and internal frictions. Olaf Scholz of the centre-left SPD governs as chancellor at the head of Germany's first three-party federal coalition, with the liberal FDP and The Greens. Opinion polls show declining support for all of the coalition parties since the 2021 election, and only one in five voters think that the government is doing a good job. Both the SPD and The Greens lost seats in the European Parliament in the June elections. Nonetheless, the government has a comfortable majority, and the constitution underpins political stability: only the chancellor can call a no-confidence vote, and only the president can call an early election (this has only happened once since reunification).
Falling public support and disappointing results in state and European Parliament elections have made the coalition partners less amenable to compromise. Frictions will increase as the 2025 election nears, amid a weak economy and a tighter than expected fiscal stance following an adverse court ruling regarding the 2024 budget. Negotiations over the budget for 2025, now under way, will prove flashpoints for further coalition strains. Public discontent with the coalition and the abrupt shift to fiscal consolidation means that strikes and protests are likely to occur sporadically throughout 2024. Mr Scholz will continue to focus considerable effort on keeping his coalition in line and public dissatisfaction under control, inhibiting his role (and influence) in wider European affairs.
Support for the far-right anti-immigration AfD party has surged over the past year. This is controversial, as the party is more extreme than its far-right counterparts in west European countries such as France or Italy: a number of local chapters of the AfD are classed as "extremist" and are under investigation by the domestic intelligence service. The AfD is currently in joint-second place in opinion polls, and came second in the European Parliament elections in June-despite a chaotic campaign with neo-Nazi extremism and Chinese spying allegations against its two lead candidates. Although the party's popularity has moderated since January, it continues to poll well above its 10.3% vote share in the 2021 federal election.
How mainstream parties deal with the AfD is now the key challenge for the German political scene. Although we expect the taboo among mainstream parties against co-operating with the AfD to remain in place, the AfD's surging popularity is prompting mainstream parties to re-evaluate their policy stances-as evidenced by the government's tightening of immigration rules. Although there has been some talk within the opposition centre-right CDU about potentially co-operating with the AfD at the local level after the autumn regional elections, doing so would draw intense criticism from within the party and risk a sharp public backlash. Co-operating at the federal level will remain out of the question.
A new party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), set up by Ms Wagenknecht, formerly of the Left Party, has taken left-wing economic positions along with a pro-Russian, anti-immigration stance and scepticism towards climate policies. In the European Parliament elections, the first test of the party's electoral appeal, the BSW won 6.2% of the vote, pulling voters from most of the established parties. The emergence of the BSW will further complicate regional coalition-building efforts, especially in eastern Germany.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The quality of administration is high, and the implementation of policies that have been passed by parliament is sound. The federal structure of the government means that considerable responsibility falls on the 16 states that constitute the republic. An advantage of this is that many issues are decided with the closer democratic involvement of the electorate. States have a strong incentive to improve their own quality of governance, as comparisons with other states are easy to make, although one drawback is that the quality of public services such as education remains heterogeneous across states. Another disadvantage is that co-ordination can be difficult in policy areas in which the states have a large role. For instance, although the federal government has allocated additional funds for infrastructure investment in recent years, state governments have often been unable to use these for additional investment owing to capacity constraints; the same can be said for EU funds utilisation. The design of the system also means that the constitutional powers enjoyed by the Bundesrat may, on occasion, limit the ability of the federal government to push through reforms in the face of opposition at state level, as state interests are represented in the Bundesrat.
A substantial majority of Germans agree that the Bundestag is too big. It has 736 members of parliament (MPs) at present, making it the largest democratically elected parliament in the world, and it is therefore expensive to run. A bill to reduce its size has been passed by the Bundestag but is currently stuck at the Constitutional Court. The bill contains three key changes: a cap on the number of MPs at 630, a more proportional distribution of seats and a stricter application of the 5% threshold for representation in parliament.
Thorough coalition agreements support smooth policymaking, up to a point Majority coalitions are the norm in Germany at both the federal and state level. This generally ensures smooth policymaking, as the coalition agreement usually sets out in advance what the government will be working on throughout its term (although of course not everything can be anticipated in advance). In the case of the current three-party federal coalition, reaching this agreement involved 22 working groups, bringing together 300 politicians, and resulted in compromises and key wins for each of the parties. The consensus-oriented political culture underpins political stability, but the current federal government is finding that the need to reach compromises between the three ruling parties makes policymaking much slower and less coherent than would be ideal.
Political outlook: Election watch The next federal election will be held in autumn 2025. The CDU (together with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU) remains the most popular party and appears well placed to return to power. Recent polls show stable support of about 30%, up from 24% in the 2021 election (and the party won 30% of the vote in the June 2024 European Parliament elections). A coalition with the FDP, the CDU's preferred partner, is unlikely to have a majority, but the CDU may be able to choose between governing with the SPD and The Greens, using competition between the two to extract maximum policy leverage.
State elections in late 2024 in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg-all part of the former East Germany, where the AfD's support is concentrated-are likely to result in the far-right party's strongest-ever vote share. As the political scene has fragmented in recent years, regional-level coalition-building has become harder. With most mainstream parties set to perform poorly in these states, there is a risk that forming a majority government without the support of extreme parties will not be possible. Co-operating with the AfD, the BSW or the Left Party would be highly controversial, but cannot be entirely ruled out.
A new electoral reform law will remove exceptions to the 5% threshold for proportional seats to reduce the size of the Bundestag (currently the largest democratically elected parliament in the world). This would mean that the Left Party and the CSU would lose parliamentary representation if they failed to secure more than 5% of the national vote at the 2025 election. Both parties are challenging this in court.
Political outlook: International relations Germany's first National Security Strategy, published in 2023, reaffirms support for NATO, the 2% of GDP defence spending target (which Germany has yet to meet, despite large planned increases) and Ukraine's defence against Russia. A separate strategy on policy towards China stresses the need for "de-risking" in strategic sectors such as critical minerals and infrastructure, but leaves the onus for doing this on companies. Germany's economic exposure to the Chinese market is much greater than that of its EU peers, and overall we expect de-risking to underwhelm, with trade and investment ties remaining substantial. The application from July of provisional EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicle (EV) imports will, however, damage German carmakers (such as BMW) with substantial production facilities in China, and make future investments in Chinese EV plants less attractive.
The EU, along with the US and other Western allies, has imposed financial, sectoral and individual sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will remain in place throughout our forecast period and beyond as the West and Russia continue their economic decoupling. We expect the war to be a protracted conflict with no clear-cut resolution. As the war drags on and costs to Ukraine's Western backers increase, there is a risk that "conflict fatigue" leads to less generous funding and military support. Should Donald Trump win the US presidential election in November, there is a high risk of a sharp decline or withdrawal of US support for Ukraine. This would strengthen Russia's position in the war and heighten security threats across Europe.

Overview: Germany's score in EIU's business environment model rises from 8.14 in the historical period (2019-23) to 8.31 in the forecast period (2024-28), lifting the country to seventh in the global ranking and fourth among its regional peers, behind Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden. The improvement mainly reflects a gradually stabilising macroeconomic environment and its beneficial impact on market opportunities; reform-led changes will be modest amid economic headwinds, fiscal constraints and tense geopolitics.
Strengths: Germany has a skilled and reasonably productive labour force, a stable political culture, fairly solid macroeconomic fundamentals, openness to foreign trade and investment, and a strong research and innovation framework. It has sound legal and regulatory structures, a broadly pro-business policy orientation, and a resilient financing environment.
Weaknesses: The tax regime places a heavy burden on labour income, and the demographic outlook is poor, which implies an ongoing issue with skilled labour shortages that will constrain potential growth. Network infrastructure is extensive, but ageing in some areas, with the digital transition lagging many regional peers. Energy costs and levels of bureaucratic "red tape" are high in a regional context.
What to watch
- Efforts to boost digitalisation and the transition to a low-carbon economy will continue, but amid coalition tensions, constrained fiscal space, a sluggish economy, and increased demands on defence and climate-related spending, policymaking will be contentious and reform progress sluggish until the next federal election, scheduled for late 2025.

Overview: Europe's largest economy has solid fundamentals for the most part, as shown by its elevated rankings. However, the global supply shocks of recent years have exposed vulnerabilities that have hindered economic performance relative to most peer countries and will constrain growth potential in 2024-28. A rise in the category score reflects our expectation of more stable trends in inflation, the exchange rate and asset markets, amid a gradual cyclical recovery from the adverse terms-of-trade shocks triggered by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Structurally, Germany faces major challenges given its previous overreliance on Russian energy and trade with China, self-imposed fiscal constraints, a lacklustre approach to supply-side reform over the past decade, and the high exposure of its large industrial sector to a global economy characterised by intensifying competition and increasing trade restrictions.
Strengths: Germany has a resilient labour market with a high employment rate and a skilled workforce. The economy is diversified, with sophisticated industrial and services sectors, a large base of innovative export-focused small and medium-sized firms (the Mittelstand), robust research and development (R&D) structures, and a long-standing external surplus. Average income levels are high, private-sector debt is moderate (by regional standards) and there is a strong institutional framework.
Weaknesses: Ageing demographics, a shrinking working-age population and rising tensions over immigration point to a growing problem of skilled labour shortages. The competitiveness of Germany's long-standing export-oriented and industry-focused growth model has been weakened amid the end of cheap Russian gas, more competitive exports from China and a more protectionist global trading environment. Poor medium-term trends in investment spending, alongside policy complacency over the past decade, mean that Germany lags many peer countries in terms of the pace and scope of its digital and green energy transitions. Labour and energy costs are high in a regional context.
What to watch
- After two years of stagnation, we expect that the economy will slowly gain momentum in 2024-25 amid a cyclical recovery across Europe. However, structural constraints, coalition tensions and complex geopolitics will temper the scope of the upswing. Fiscal space is limited, with a legal ruling in late 2023 having clamped down on the government's regular use of off-balance-sheet vehicles to circumvent the "debt brake" fiscal rule. Consolidation measures will need to be agreed in the 2025 budget, which could heighten coalition strains.
- The scale and pace of monetary loosening by the European Central Bank (ECB) will have a considerable bearing on economic activity in Germany and across the euro zone, in terms of influencing sentiment and consumption over the coming months and in shaping the investment outlook and fiscal space over the five-year forecast period. A too-timid ECB or sticky supply-driven price pressures could lead to a slower than expected policy easing cycle, constraining growth prospects.

Overview: Germany offers a reasonably attractive environment for private enterprise, albeit with more restricted services competition and more complex planning regulation than in some peer countries. Amid the comparatively poor performance of the economy in recent years and increased cost-competitiveness pressures, criticism by business of the regulatory burden in Germany has intensified. We do not expect any significant improvements in the forecast period. The level of state involvement in the economy is modest in a European context but has risen since 2020, and this trend will probably persist over the forecast period, in the context of a broad EU (and global) shift towards greater industrial sovereignty and increased subsidy intervention.
Strengths: Private enterprise is supported by a robust and fairly transparent institutional structure, a stable legal code, high-class research and innovation capacity, and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. Price controls are limited and there is strong protection of private property and intellectual property rights. The competition authority, the Federal Cartel Office, is reasonably efficient, and administrative processes for accessing utilities, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency are fairly straightforward.
Weaknesses: While robust, the overall regulatory framework can be more complex and expensive for businesses to navigate than in many peer countries. The time and costs involved to establish a new business, hire labour and gain planning approval tend to be above the OECD average, owing in part to dense bureaucratic procedures, the limited scope and variable quality of e-government services, and staff shortages across the public administration. There are relatively high barriers to competition (in a regional context) in certain transport, utilities, retail and business services sectors.
What to watch
- Regional tensions over state aid and the green transition could intensify as the EU implements its Green Deal Industrial Plan in response to increased US spending on green industrial policy-under its Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)-and amid efforts to reduce the bloc's supply dependence on China. Relaxed state aid rules for "investments in renewable energy and decarbonising industry" have been extended by the European Commission to end-2025, in part to mitigate the IRA's impact, which risks diverting investment away from the EU by providing subsidies for North American-based production. Germany (and France) will probably benefit the most, having more capacity to support domestic industries than smaller member states, which have raised concerns over distortion of the bloc's "level playing field" provisions.
- In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy-price shock, in 2022 the government fast-tracked targeted legislation that streamlined planning and approvals procedures in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, leading to the completion within a year of several new LNG import terminals-a rapid turnaround for a major infrastructure project. In May 2024 the coalition agreed on reform proposals aimed more broadly at simplifying bureaucratic procedures for new investment projects. The changes look to be fairly modest in scope and are still to be approved by parliament.

Overview: Policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) is fairly liberal (as in most EU countries), and Germany will remain a major destination for capital inflows in 2024-28, given its economic size and solid business environment. The country's relative attractiveness as an FDI destination has deteriorated slightly in recent years, amid a broad tightening of FDI screening provisions at EU level and a general hardening of sentiment towards non-EU capital inflows (especially from China owing to concerns over intellectual property transfer). In addition, the indirect effects of a global shift towards subsidised industrial policy and structural constraints in Germany have become more evident. This is reflected in moderate falls in the category score and rankings.
Strengths: Germany's skilled labour force, good transport infrastructure, strong research and innovation capacity, an extensive network of supplier companies, and a reliable administrative and legal environment are all appealing features to foreign investors. Specific restrictions on foreign ownership or control apply only in a few sectors, such as media, defence and infrastructure. Foreign and domestic investors are treated equally in terms of investment incentives (which tend to be limited) and protection of real and intellectual property.
Weaknesses: These largely mirror the investment-related challenges faced by domestic firms, such as comparatively high tax rates and energy costs, skilled labour shortages, shortcomings in digital infrastructure, and comparatively stringent regulations (Germany has traditionally adopted a fairly strict interpretation of EU regulations when transposing them into national law, to a greater extent than many other member states).
What to watch
- The scope of the monitoring framework has broadened significantly in recent years, with mandatory reviews now likely for a large share of FDI transactions. Scrutiny of prospective foreign investments is likely to be tightened further over the forecast period through additional amendments. As well as a degree of official interpretation over what constitutes "critical sectors" and "national security risk", this implies a less predictable framework for investors with regard to the processes of FDI screening and project approval.
- Global competition for high-tech green investment will be fierce, amid expanded state subsidy schemes in the EU and the US that aim to counter state subsidies in China. Data are patchy, but a recent increase in FDI flows into the US (including major projects by German automotive and ICT companies) is likely to have included some "diverted" investment from the EU. It is not a one-way street, with EU subsidy programmes playing a major role in securing recent large investments in Germany, including from Intel (US), Northvolt (Sweden) and the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC (Taiwan). However, some firms are dissatisfied with some aspects of the business environment, and attracting new FDI (and retaining incumbents) will be a more challenging task than in previous years.

Overview: A high category score reflects Germany's traditional openness to international commerce, the importance to the economy of foreign trade and the country's membership of the EU, which provides for freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons within the bloc. The score declines slightly for 2024-28, reflecting exposure to what is likely to be a more unstable geopolitical environment and an underlying deterioration in trading conditions amid increased protectionism and regionalisation, tighter bilateral controls on technology, and gradually worsening West-China relations.
Strengths: Germany has a diverse and sophisticated export mix, as well as an extensive and established global supply-chain network. Attention often focuses on the large (and important) automotive and chemicals sectors, but the huge number of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs-the Mittelstand) are the principal underlying driver of export and economic activity. Bureaucratic obstacles to foreign trade are fairly low. Trade with other non-EU countries is subject to moderate customs duties.
Weaknesses: The country's export-focused manufacturing sector comprises a comparatively large share of cyclical goods (such as cars, chemicals and machinery equipment) and so is more exposed to shifts in global industrial and consumer demand than other major advanced economies. The pivot away from Russian gas and the ongoing green transition in the energy and automotive sectors are prompting major structural changes to the economy and an erosion of competitiveness in some sectors.
What to watch
- Cost-competitiveness has been weakened by the supply shocks of recent years and faces ongoing challenges amid structurally higher costs, expanding higher-value competition from Asia and heightened global industrial policy. We assume that EU-US ties will remain reasonably stable in the near term as shared geopolitical concerns overshadow bilateral trade issues, but this dynamic could shift over time, particularly if the 2024 US presidential election results in a second Donald Trump presidency, which would probably reshape many areas of trade and foreign policy, including on China and Russia.
- EU-China tensions have risen as China has come to be viewed more as a systemic rival, with the bloc adopting a more forceful stance on strategic sector access, human rights issues, investment screening and "de-risking" efforts to mitigate supply-chain dependence. We expect a gradual deterioration in EU-China bilateral ties. Germany's stance towards China has toughened, but is likely to remain less antagonistic than that of most EU peers (in the near term at least), reflecting its relatively high trade exposure to China, the substantial investments of many large German companies in the country and the reality that China will remain a key market in many firms' global value chains given that it is a dominant source of many raw materials.

Overview: The tax regime is predictable but fairly complex and one of the weaker areas of the business environment, levying a comparatively high tax burden on labour income and companies. Only minor changes are expected in 2024-28, with Germany losing ground in the global ranking. As in most peer countries, the tax/GDP ratio has trended higher in recent years and was 42% in 2022 (latest comparable Eurostat data), similar to the euro zone average. Taken together, direct taxes on personal income and net social-security contributions (labour taxes) account for a higher than average proportion of tax receipts, whereas revenue shares from environmental, property and wealth taxes are below the regional average. The standard VAT rate is 19%, slightly below the EU average, with a reduced rate of 7% on certain goods and services. Most employees pay social-security contributions into insurance funds covering pensions, healthcare, unemployment and long-term care.
Strengths: The stability of the tax regime is generally supportive of medium-term business investment planning, more so than in the UK, for example, where electorally motivated tinkering with tax rates and thresholds is a regular occurrence. The integrated nature of the tax system with the broad framework of social-security contributions supports a broad tax base and underpins comparatively high levels of social welfare in the economy. A relatively smooth tax administration process for businesses also supports the category.
Weaknesses: The labour tax wedge is among the highest in the OECD. This burden particularly affects lower-income workers and acts as a disincentive for second earners, partly contributing to Germany's modest full-time female employment rate. The effective tax burden for companies is on the higher side in a regional context, despite a moderate headline federal corporation tax rate of 15%. Including a local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and other levies, the effective average corporation tax rate rises to about 30%. The corporate tax framework is moderately complex, but reforms are actively being implemented.
What to watch
- The Growth Opportunities Act, implemented in April 2024, comprised minor reforms aimed at supporting business investment, simplifying VAT rules and reducing tax bureaucracy for smaller firms. It included a slightly expanded R&D allowance and higher tax-exemption thresholds. Owing to coalition tensions, the act was significantly watered down from the original plans that had included tax credits and green-related investment tax incentives.
- Given the subdued economic outlook and self-imposed fiscal constraints, the government may consider reforming certain taxes or reducing tax credits for distortionary subsidies to boost tax revenue. A carbon-pricing system introduced in 2021 will be gradually amended as the EU phases in its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism by end-2025. We expect modest progress in digitalisation of the tax administration. A delayed reform of property tax is due to take effect from 2025 (the current system is based on values dating from the 1960s), but another deferral is possible.

Overview: Germany compares favourably for its financing environment, which has been resilient amid the economic shocks of recent years, supported by the stabilising effects of policy support, a competitive banking sector and the prominent role of the KfW (the largest national development bank in Europe). A higher category score in 2024-28 reflects a gradual expansion of non-bank funding channels and an ongoing post-pandemic reduction in state distortions (with these trends mirrored in most peer countries). The three-tier banking system comprises large private commercial banks (the two biggest are Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank), state-owned regional lenders, and an extensive network of local credit co-operatives and public-sector savings banks (owned by local authorities) that primarily service the Mittelstand. Alongside the KfW, this offers a range of finance options, but also puts downward pressure on bank margins. Internally generated funds account for an above-average share of corporate financing, reflecting firms' relatively low reliance on capital markets.
Strengths: Bank capital levels and liquidity coverage are above regulatory minimums, asset quality appears sound, and there is a low level of non-performing loans (NPLs). Higher interest rates drove firm gains in revenue and profitability in 2022-23-after a protracted period of weakness-which has improved cost-income ratios and overall stability. Bank credit is the preferred SME funding channel, being relatively cheap and available at long maturities.
Weaknesses: In a European context, Germany's retail banking sector has long struggled with a comparatively high cost base, weak profitability and low returns on equity, reflecting in part its fragmented and competitive structure. The recent strong net interest income gains have driven an improvement, but structural banking indicators will remain weaker than in most regional peers. Venture capital markets have expanded only slowly and are less developed than in most large high-income countries. Availability of early- and late-stage growth capital for start-ups and smaller firms remains fairly restrictive.
What to watch
- Credit demand is expected to strengthen gradually in 2024-25 as economic activity firms, but will remain relatively subdued. Loan losses remain at a low level, but have risen slightly since mid-2023. The recent tailwind to banks' net interest income and profitability will moderate amid higher deposit funding costs, the pass-through impact of subdued economic activity and an expected gradual reduction in official euro zone policy interest rates from mid-2024.
- Vulnerabilities in the German residential and commercial real estate sectors increased steadily over the historical period, in the context of rising financialisation, low borrowing costs, constrained housing supply, loosened credit standards and pandemic-driven changes in property demand. Real estate prices rose strongly, particularly in major cities, with prices in some segments appearing increasingly misaligned from fundamentals. Higher interest rates and cost-of-living pressures have dampened mortgage demand and driven a modest correction in property prices, but underlying imbalances will persist.

Solid labour market indicators in the decade prior to the pandemic, and a resilient performance since 2020, reflect a generally productive, skilled and flexible workforce, which stems in part from major liberalising reforms in the 2000s. However, there are a number of weaker areas, and poor demographics imply an ongoing serious issue of skilled labour shortages. We expect little change in the score or rankings in 2024-28.
Strengths: Germany has a skilled and reasonably productive workforce, low unemployment, defined employer-employee relations, a statutory national minimum wage, and a well-established framework of vocational training and apprenticeships. The proportion of ICT specialists is slightly above the regional average (although it still lags demand, constraining the pace of digital transformation). Employment prospects (and the participation rate) of older workers have improved, partly in response to a phased rise in the statutory retirement age (to 67 by 2031), although early retirement schemes remain in place.
Weaknesses: A declining working-age population implies persistent labour supply challenges and skills shortages in 2024-28. A spike in sickness absence, to a record level in 2023, points to a recent further impediment for the labour market. Unit labour costs and average living costs are comparatively high. Participation of women in full-time employment is modest, constrained by limited childcare availability (despite reforms since 2017) and tax disincentives for second earners. There is a large gap between employment rates of female EU and non-EU nationals (more so than for men), implying transition issues into the labour market. The share of low-skilled, low-wage employment in the economy has risen steadily over the past decade.
What to watch
- There has been a more concerted policy focus in recent years on programmes aimed at better integrating disadvantaged groups-young workers, the lower skilled, women and foreign nationals-into the labour market, but their impact will be only gradual.
- An influx of approximately 1m immigrants due to the conflict in Ukraine has relieved some labour-shortage pressures. Since mid-2023 amendments to the Skilled Immigration Act have led to a moderate loosening of fairly complex rules for foreign workers with tertiary degrees or professional and vocational training. In addition, a new law was passed in January 2024 allowing for multiple citizenships, leading to record naturalisation rates in 2023. More liberalising reforms are needed to alleviate labour shortages, but the government's stance towards immigration is likely to turn more restrictive, in line with shifting public attitudes towards migrants.

Overview: Network infrastructure is for the most part extensive and of good quality, but low capital investment over the past decade has led to a gradual ageing and deterioration in standards, constrained the pace of digital transformation, and raised capacity concerns in the energy transition policy (Energiewende) around renewables. The fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war has led to recent investment efforts being focused primarily on energy security, inhibiting progress in other areas. The investment focus will broaden in 2024-28, but we expect only a minor improvement amid coalition strains, a recent scaling-back of fiscal plans, regulatory hurdles and external market pressures.
Strengths: Germany's infrastructure is well integrated into European networks. Transport infrastructure is of a good standard, the retail and distribution network is of high quality, and operational disruptions are comparatively rare (although there has been a gradual increase in capacity-related delays, especially to north-south freight transport). Germany compares favourably at the regional level for overall digital connectivity, with high mobile and broadband penetration rates, competitive pricing and strong progress in its 5G network rollout. A substantial amount of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure came online in 2023, improving Germany's energy security and reducing its reliance on Russian gas to zero, from 55% of total gas use before the Ukraine war.
Weaknesses: Internet speeds are only around the EU average and well below the world's leading digital countries. Despite recent stronger momentum in the provision of ultra-fast broadband services, availability of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband connections is among the lowest in the EU. Years of spending restraint have heightened road congestion and repair backlogs, with poor co-ordination between the different levels of government delaying high-speed rail projects and the planned Fehmarn Belt link with Denmark. Firms building new supply-chain warehouses and factories face a bureaucratic and protracted approval process.
What to watch
- Upgraded public investment plans (supported by EU grants) are targeted towards digital connectivity and skills, decarbonisation, hydrogen technology, and rail network modernisation. The huge scale and disruptive impact of the green and digital transitions imply only a gradual pace of change, with progress constrained by structurally higher energy and financing costs, fiscal constraints, a sluggish economy, stringent planning laws, and pushback from vested interests.
- Accelerated plans for FTTH rollout, ongoing 5G network builds and targeted policy support (including EU grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility-RRF) will bring gradual improvements in full-fibre availability and further narrow the urban-rural digital divide, but achieving nationwide full-coverage targets for gigabit-ready broadband (by 2025) and full-fibre access (by 2030) will be challenging. A 13% FTTH share of connections at end-2023 was similar to that in the UK and Austria, but well below an EU average of near 50% and shares of more than 80% in Spain and Sweden.

Overview: Germany scores highly in this category, which builds on the scope and decent quality of its digital infrastructure and the robust framework for research and innovation. We expect it to maintain an elevated position in the rankings, although there is more room for improvements in the digitalisation of government services. R&D intensity has trended gradually higher over the past decade, driven primarily by large firms in medium- and high-tech manufacturing (the electric-vehicle shift in the automotive industry has been a major driver). Total investment in R&D has averaged just above 3% of GDP in recent years, one of the highest ratios in the EU and well above the 2.2% average, although an official target of 3.5% by 2025 is unlikely to be met. In recent years Germany has slipped from being an "innovation leader" to a "strong innovator" on the European Commission's Innovation Scoreboard, with national indicators of innovative high-growth firms, start-up activity and SME innovations having weakened slightly-mostly owing to stronger incentives elsewhere.
Strengths: Germany has reasonably strong e-commerce and e-business penetration, a national Industry 4.0 initiative aimed at supporting digital manufacturing, an above-average share of ICT specialists, and well-developed innovation structures. A mandate for e-invoicing for tax receipts by 2025 will reduce paperwork burdens.
Weaknesses: Less favourable aspects are a comparatively slow pace of ultrafast fibre broadband rollout, modest rates of digital adoption (and innovation activity) by SMEs, below-average basic digital skill levels and limited early-stage financing support for start-ups. Germany lags well behind most peer countries in the quality and scope of digital public services.
What to watch
- The stated policy focus is to bolster digital adoption by SMEs and the quality of e-government services (particularly in the health system, and by harmonising infrastructure across the federal, state and municipal levels), as well as increasing the share of ICT specialists in the workforce. Funding will be supported by RRF grants, which will also be directed to EU-wide initiatives in microelectronics and next-generation cloud infrastructure.
- In March 2024 the EU implemented its first AI Act, establishing a common regulatory and legal framework for AI models and systems. It implies tighter controls than in the US, the UK and Asia, raising concerns in some quarters that it could impede innovation in the bloc and lead to AI investment leaking abroad.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government is now in the second half of its term, and much of its coalition agreement has been enacted or affected by adverse events. Amid coalition tensions, constrained fiscal space, a weak economy, and increased demands on defence and climate-related spending, policymaking will be contentious and reform progress sluggish until the next federal election in 2025.
The war in Ukraine and the energy price shock have focused investment efforts on energy security and building infrastructure for liquefied natural gas (LNG). This has slightly inhibited medium-term capital investment projects relating to semiconductors, 5G mobile technology and automotive innovation. Green investment is another area of focus, although proposals have been scaled back since a Federal Constitutional Court ruling in 2023 upended fiscal plans. The Climate and Transformation Fund has been reduced by EUR12bn in 2024 and a further EUR45bn up to 2027. However, it will still involve EUR160bn in investment, targeted towards hydrogen infrastructure, incentivising the switch to clean energy in industry and a change to the funding of renewable power to reduce the burden on consumers.
Controlling immigration has become a more salient issue amid the rise in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and an increase in refugee inflows. The government recorded 352,000 asylum applications in 2023, a 50% rise from the previous year. The government plans to tighten rules governing the asylum system and has imposed temporary border checks with Poland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Austria.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Government debt 63.6 62.8 61.7 60.7 59.9 59.0
German fiscal policy was thrown into disarray by a ruling from the Federal Constitutional Court in November 2023. Germany has had a constitutionally mandated "debt brake" since 2009, limiting the annual structural federal budget deficit to 0.35% of GDP outside recessions or national emergencies to contain the debt/GDP ratio. Amid a push to bolster historically modest levels of public investment, the government had turned to off-balance-sheet vehicles to circumvent the debt brake constraints. However, the court ruling struck down the planned reallocation of EUR60bn of funding from an off-balance-sheet vehicle for pandemic relief into one for green investment. This forced the coalition to retroactively suspend the debt brake for 2023 and completely overhaul its 2024 budget. The two largest funds are unaffected: a EUR100bn investment fund for the armed forces is constitutionally protected, and EUR200bn in energy support is due to be phased out. However, similar vehicles are likely to be eschewed in future.
The new 2024 budget struck a compromise between the parties' competing demands, resolving the impasse over a EUR17bn annual funding gap. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) avoided invoking the crisis exemption to the debt brake but agreed to higher business costs (including a plastic levy), higher carbon taxes and reduced business subsidies. The Greens protected core provisions of the Climate and Transformation Fund but accepted a cut in spending, including an earlier than planned removal of subsidies for solar power and electric vehicles (EVs). The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Greens secured welfare benefit levels, but households will face higher electricity and petrol costs. There will be some offsetting impact from higher income-tax thresholds and tax relief for firms under the Growth Opportunities Act. However, Germany's investment deficit with peer economies will widen as capital spending on green initiatives, transport infrastructure and the digital transition falls behind.
We expect that fiscal consolidation this year will shrink the budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP, from 2.5% in 2023. Public debt will fall slightly from 63.6% of GDP in 2023 to about 59% at end-2028. There is limited political appetite to repeal or significantly reform the debt brake (any change would require a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag), but this could change if the current period of economic weakness becomes markedly more protracted.

The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its interest rates for the first time at its meeting on June 6th, after raising them by 450 basis points since July 2022. The 25-basis-point cut was in line with our forecasts, and makes the ECB the first major global central bank to start monetary easing (we expect the US Federal Reserve to follow suit in September). The ECB reiterated its view that rates were at an appropriate level for inflation to converge to its 2% target in a "sustained manner", while continuing its gradual transition to a more dovish stance. Headline euro zone inflation rose to 2.6% year on year in May, from 2.4% in April, with core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy prices) also increasing from 2.7% in April to 2.9% in May. Disinflation will remain bumpy, amid pockets of resilient services inflation, structurally higher energy price pressures and ongoing labour supply constraints. We forecast that the bank will cut its key policy rates by 25 basis points again in September and December, with the main refinancing rate falling from 4.25% currently to 3.75% at end-2024 and settling at about 2.3% in 2026-28 (well above the near-zero average in the 2010s).

Near-term economic prospects are finally starting to improve after a prolonged period of stagnation. Real GDP in the first quarter of 2024 remained slightly smaller than two years earlier, but quarter-on-quarter growth turned positive, and high-frequency indicators suggest that this gradual improvement will be sustained. We forecast a 0.3% expansion in the economy this year, still the worst outturn in the G7 group of countries, but an improvement from zero growth last year. A number of factors will support this. Real wages are turning positive amid slowing inflation, and the labour market remains resilient, strengthening domestic demand. Financing conditions are set to improve now that the ECB has begun monetary easing, supporting growth in investment spending. And although global trade activity remains weak, the export sector is recovering, with demand rising from the US and China.
We expect stronger growth in 2025, at 1.2%, supported by robust household finances and pent-up consumer spending demand, plus the resilient capacity of the large group of diverse small and medium-sized firms (the Mittelstand). Global economic growth will also strengthen, providing a more favourable external context. However, the pace of expansion will remain constrained by geopolitical pressures, notably strains with China (including over EU EV tariffs) and the risks posed by the US election. Should Mr Trump win the presidency in the US-Germany's largest export market-in November (not our core forecast) and impose blanket import tariffs on trading partners, we would revise our inflation forecasts up and our growth forecasts down.
In the longer term, German economic growth will be held back by structural challenges arising from low public investment spending, sluggish digitalisation, comparatively slow adaptation to trends in the automotive sector and the green energy transition. Germany's ageing demographics and declining working-age population also imply that labour shortages will become a more pressing issue over the next decade. We forecast 1.3% average growth in 2026-28.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Services account for about 70% of GDP, industry for almost 30% and agriculture less than 1%. The share of industry in the German economy exceeds those of all the other major economies in western Europe, with Italy at about 24% and the UK and France at about 18%. Much of the German economy is built upon this industrial base, helping the economy to retain high-value jobs and research centres, and elevating its position in global value chains. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed the risks of Germany's dependence on its industrial sector. Although German industries have made strong progress in reducing energy usage, input costs are set to remain higher than historical levels, weakening the competitiveness of German firms. The industrial sector is therefore likely to gradually lose global market share over our forecast period.
The automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition Germany's most important manufacturing sectors are automotive; electrical and mechanical engineering; chemicals; and food, drink and tobacco. Germany is the global leader in the production of premium cars, an industry that has benefited from robust competition between several domestic companies, ownership structures that have enabled firms to make long-term investments, and a host of innovative supplier companies in the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Cluster effects are significant, and Germany's industrial champions increasingly provide value added through services supplied in conjunction with manufactured products.
The automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles, having historically invested heavily in diesel technology and entered the electric market comparatively late. This transition will be particularly disruptive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that produce intermediate components for the carmaking sector, as electric motors require far fewer components than internal-combustion engines, with the most significant component being the battery. A Tesla (US) gigafactory that opened in March 2022 outside Berlin, the capital, was built in an exceptionally fast 22 months, and is producing batteries as well as electric cars. Germany is set to be the largest manufacturer of batteries in Europe in the coming years, with about 550 GWh of capacity set to come online in the coming years. The major investors are Northvolt (Sweden), CATL (China), CustomCells and PowerCo (both Germany), in addition to many smaller producers. Many of these factories will be financed by subsidies under the EU's answer to the US's green subsidy plan, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Although China will continue to dwarf Europe's lithium battery production capacity, an upcoming increase in EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), following an anti-subsidy probe, will help to bolster Europe's domestic EV production, and hence also its battery production supply chain.
Trade ties with China are weakening. China was Germany's second-largest export market in 2022 but fell to fourth place in 2023, behind the US, France and the Netherlands. Although the EU and to a lesser extent Germany are aiming to reduce their dependence on trade with China, this will only occur slowly owing to Germany's strong investment ties with China. The sale in October 2022 of a stake in the port of Hamburg-Germany's largest port and the third busiest in the EU-to a Chinese investor was particularly controversial. Germany's BASF (the largest chemicals producer in the world) has decided to permanently downsize its operations in Europe while investing in a EUR10bn plant in China. Indeed, many automakers, including Volkswagen (Germany), are doubling down on their investments in Chinese production facilities to serve the increasingly important Chinese market, despite growing competition in Germany from Chinese marques. The Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) are in favour of tougher restrictions on trade and investment deals with China, and US pressure will be in the same direction, but the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will aim to keep change gradual, to protect German industry.
Most industries derive competitive advantages from Germany's well-developed system of vocational training, good physical infrastructure and research base, and a tax system that encourages capital investment. Fiscal stimulus measures targeted towards infrastructure improvements, the green and digital transitions, and energy security will continue to support the construction sector, although consumer demand is moderating in the face of rising interest rates.
A stable services sector has counterbalanced industrial weakness The services sector is the largest component of GDP and comprises a broad range of activities, from retailing to financial services, logistics and healthcare. Many of the changes prompted by the pandemic-more remote working, less business travel, a rise in e-commerce at the expense of bricks-and-mortar retailers-will endure throughout our forecast period. The financial services sector is important in Germany, but at 4.2% of GDP in 2023 it is smaller relative to the size of the economy than in Japan (5%), the US (6.9%) or the UK (8.3%). It coped well with the economic shocks from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, aided by extensive monetary and fiscal support, as well as reforms and restructuring over the past decade. Capital levels and liquidity coverage are well above regulatory minimums, but conditions will remain challenging in the coming years amid a sluggish economy, tight financing conditions, firmer price pressures and a softer housing market.

Labour costs per hour (US$; level) 51.1 52.6 55.3 58.5 61.0 63.4
We forecast that inflation will ease to an average of 2.4% in 2024, from 6% in 2023. Moderating energy and food prices will be the main drivers of the slowdown, but inflation will be stubborn in the services sector, held up by robust wage growth. We expect commodity prices to broadly stabilise (although there are upside risks in a strained geopolitical environment). Annual inflation will remain above the ECB's 2% target until the very end of the year, largely owing to base effects. As interest rates fall and the economic recovery slowly gains momentum, we expect a shift from mostly supply-side to demand-side inflationary pressures. We expect annual average inflation of 2% in 2025-28.

We expect the euro to depreciate slightly against the US dollar this year, to US$1.09:EUR1 at the end of 2024, from US$1.11:EUR1 at the end of 2023. Factors such as an improvement in the euro zone's terms of trade and overall economic outlook will continue to provide some support to the euro. However, growing interest-rate divergence between the ECB (which began its easing cycle in June) and the Federal Reserve (which we expect to begin in September), will put a lid on the euro appreciation vis-à-vis the dollar in the remainder of 2024. We expect a gradual appreciation in 2025-28, as a widening average current-account surplus will support the currency's value.

Secondary income balance -69.8 -62.5 -65.9 -59.9 -50.8 -40.6
We expect the current-account surplus to stabilise over the forecast period at about 5-6% of GDP as merchandise imports strengthen and in response to more subdued demand for German exports than before the pandemic. This will reflect relatively sluggish growth in major export markets in Europe, softer trend demand from China (due to economic and geopolitical factors), structural global shifts in key export sectors such as automotive, and the weakened price competitiveness of domestic industry following the supply-side disruption of recent years and the end of cheap Russian gas imports. Key risks are a tit-for-tat trade war with China following new EU EV tariffs, and Mr Trump's proposed tariffs should he win the US election (not our core forecast). Germany will continue to record a comparatively large merchandise trade surplus and a sizeable primary income surplus, the latter driven by income returns from investments abroad financed by the substantial stock of domestic savings.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Germany Stocks and flows Germany is an attractive destination for foreign investment, but the country's role as an exporter of long-term capital is more important: it is the fourth-largest investor in the world. The country's net international investment position has risen in recent years to EUR2.8trn by the third quarter of 2023. The skills of its workforce, the availability of supplier companies, the quality of the research and innovation framework, and a reliable administrative and legal environment make Germany one of the most attractive global destinations for inward foreign direct investment (FDI). However, relative to GDP, the stock of such investment is lower than in some comparatively sized economies. Following a significant increase in inflows during the 1990s, the rate of growth of FDI slowed, falling below the world average, and outflows have exceeded inflows since 2004-with the exception of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the progress of investment deals. Following a record-high net investment outflow of $117bn in 2022, weaker global investment sentiment reduced net outflows to $64bn in 2023. EIU expects net outflows to rise slightly in the forecast period, averaging US$77bn in 2024-28 as global economic sentiment improves. At end-2023 the inward FDI stock was $2.16trn, or 48.4% of GDP; the outward FDI stock was $3.26trn, or 73% of GDP.
Origin and distribution About two-thirds of Germany's inward FDI stock originates from other EU member states-although this sometimes includes investment from outside the EU that is transferred through countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg, often for tax reasons. The most important investor from outside the EU is the US, which accounts for 8% of the total stock. The US was responsible for the largest number of greenfield and expansion projects in 2022, at 279, and also for the largest single investment-a EUR17bn deal by Intel (US) to build a "mega fab" chip manufacturing plant in Magdeburg, which will benefit from subsidies under the EU's European Chips Act. Authorities and companies have become increasingly hesitant about increasing investment from China (which amounts to just over 1% of the FDI stock), which often targets mid-sized companies with significant technological know-how. In 2023 there were 257 cases under review under Germany's investment screening framework, 96 of which related to investment from the US, while only 21 concerned investment from China. Only ten cases resulted in restricting measures against the investment project. The presence of Chinese investment is small, but increased scrutiny of Chinese investments will nevertheless impact the appetite for Chinese-origin investments, including the proposed expansion of the CATL battery factory in the central German town of Arnstadt. Most outward investment is to other EU countries, but investment in Switzerland, the US and China is also significant. German firms have massively disinvested from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leading to a flow of EUR3bn back to Germany. Many investments were lost, written down or expropriated by Russia, leading to significant losses for German firms. Financial and insurance activities made up the largest share of the inward FDI stock in 2023, at about 44% of the total.
Determinants Germany's attractiveness as an investment location stems from its robust institutional framework, stable legal code, strong research and innovation capacity, and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. The country also has good infrastructure, a number of innovative high-tech clusters and a high-quality workforce. Labour costs are among the highest in the world, but compare strongly with European peers owing to a lengthy period of wage restraint. Germany Trade and Invest is the first point of contact for foreign investors, and provides details about recent trends and growing areas of demand-although the number of FDI projects in 2023 was 1,759, 24 less than in 2022, the annual volume of FDI rose by 37%. Foreign investors, including private equity firms, are attracted by the large number of profitable medium-sized companies specialising in niche markets. Regulations such as the right of worker representatives to sit on company boards (up to half of board members) have deterred some foreign investors, but in practice the system of workforce representation in companies often helps management bodies to communicate their strategies and, where necessary, explain the need for changes in working practice-or even reduced pay in difficult circumstances.
Impact Foreign-owned companies employ about 2.5m people in Germany. Many FDI inflows take the form of acquisitions rather than greenfield investment, and hence the immediate impact on employment is not clear (and in some cases is initially negative). In industry, especially manufacturing, the dominance of German firms means that FDI has had only a limited impact. Foreign investment in Germany's services has had a larger impact on the domestic economy, boosting productivity via the introduction of new technology and fewer hierarchical organisational structures. Investment by private equity groups has also helped to inject capital and managerial expertise into slow-growing family-owned businesses.
Potential Germany's skilled workforce and sound infrastructure make it a good location for specialised manufacturing. More generally, the structure of German industry is still relatively fragmented, providing foreign investors with the opportunity to participate in sectoral consolidation and reap economies of scale through acquisitions. The generational changeover at the helm of several small and medium-sized companies provides opportunities for foreign investors, although in many cases foreign involvement is not appreciated. The still-moderate level of property prices-by west European standards-and increasing demand for housing, especially in urban areas, may attract investors into this sector. A poor demographic outlook, with population growth set to stagnate and then decline, will constrain Germany's potential as a consumer market. Government screening of inward investment has increased recently and will remain high, as political pressure to protect sensitive industries has increased in recent years. This is the case across Europe, and has led to delays in approving projects and more frequent rejections of takeovers. A greater impetus in promoting a European industrial strategy may boost investment subsidies in strategic sectors, particularly for supply chains critical to the green and digital transitions.

The total population will begin falling from 2029 onwards Germany's population declined between 2002 and 2011, but high levels of net immigration underpinned population growth in the 2012-19 period. Population growth has slowed since then, not least because of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21. The arrival of just over 1m Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine will raise the total population to about 85m by end-2024, but this was a one-off bump, and EIU nows expect a period of population decline.
The population has recorded a natural decline in every year since 1972, with the death rate higher than the birth rate, and this will continue to be the case in 2024-28. The birth rate plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, especially in the former East Germany. Although the fertility rate has since risen to 1.46 in 2023, owing to an expansion in childcare provision and parental benefits and a higher fertility rate among immigrant communities, it remains well below the replacement rate of 2.1 needed to keep the population size constant in the absence of migration.
Population growth will depend on net immigration, given no natural growth Population growth since 1972 has come entirely from positive net immigration. This peaked in 2015 during the migrant crisis, when migrants and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa were attracted to Germany in particular because of its strong economy and initially welcoming policy stance. However, the sheer volume of arrivals soon proved politically unsustainable, prompting a hardening of the government's position. The influx of migrants slowed in 2016-17, reflecting the closing of the Balkan route into the EU and an agreement (brokered by Germany) between the EU and Turkey to stop migrants crossing into the bloc illegally from Turkey. In 2022 Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted another outflow of refugees, but the European identity and cultural similarities of these people, along with strong political support for the country's plight across the EU, meant that the popular reaction was much more positive. So far Germany has accepted just over 1m refugees, the largest number in the EU after Poland (1.8m). The EU has agreed on a temporary mechanism for Ukrainian refugees that gives them the right to live and work in the bloc for up to three years without complex asylum procedures, aiding their integration into the labour force.
The working-age population is declining more swiftly than the European average Nonetheless, the demographic outlook will remain poor. As in the region more broadly, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline. We expect the share of the population aged 15-64 to fall throughout the forecast period, from 63.3% in 2023 to 60.7% in 2028. The share of the working-age population in Germany dipped below that of Italy in 2018 and the UK in 2020. By 2028 the share of the working-age population in Germany will be lower than in all of Europe, except for France. In addition, the size of the working-age population is forecast to contract the fastest in Europe (tied with Italy), at an average of -0.8% per year in the forecast period. This will lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, while exacerbating labour shortages. Efforts have already been made to attract more women and older workers into employment, but there will be diminishing returns from these measures over the forecast period. Policy innovation will also be needed to attract immigrants into the labour market.
Germany has the second-highest number of immigrants in the world, after the US, with more than 20m first- and second-generation immigrants (18% of the total population). The largest groups in 2022 (latest available data) were from Turkey, Ukraine (many of whom were refugees from the war), Syria, Romania and Poland. The rate of immigration from elsewhere in the EU has slowed since the 2010s, reflecting rising wages and living standards in immigrants' home countries, and these arrivals have been replaced by immigrants from non-EU countries. Germany has largely been successful at integrating the migrant labour force, and this has been the case with Ukrainian refugees as well. A majority of these refugees plan to return to Ukraine once this is possible, but the protracted nature of the conflict means that their presence will probably become less temporary as the war drags on.

Germany will remain the fourth-largest economy in the world in 2027 Measured by GDP at current exchange rates, Germany is currently the third-largest economy in the world, behind the US and China. According to EIU's forecasts, Japan's economy will overtake Germany by 2028, with German GDP at about US$5.4trn. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, the German economy is the fifth largest in the world, behind China, the US, India and Japan. Germany is the largest economy in Europe, about 1.4 times the size of the French economy, the second largest; and accounts for just over 20% of total EU GDP. It is the largest consumer market in the EU in terms of population size, and GDP per head is the highest of the big economies. However, the market for consumer goods is reduced by an elevated savings rate, a cultural reluctance to buy on credit and the second-highest tax wedge as a share of labour costs in the OECD.

Consumption demand will recover, but only slowly The recent cost-of-living crisis has led to significant changes in household consumption patterns in Germany. Retail spending remains depressed and is struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels. We forecast a continued, albeit protracted, recovery in consumer spending in 2024, followed by a more robust cyclical improvement in the rest of the forecast period. Despite the start of monetary easing by the European Central Bank, elevated interest rates and tight lending standards will shape much of the spending outlook in the coming quarters. Support will come from a resilient labour market, rising real wages and a steady recovery in disposable income, but consumer sentiment and buying intentions will take time to recover, with confidence still very weak in historical terms. There is an ongoing post-pandemic reallocation of spending from goods back towards services, with "revenge tourism"-to make up for the years of pandemic-related travel restrictions-still a notable trend in the EU. Retail sales volumes-which account for about a third of consumer spending in Germany-have remained weak so far in 2024, and we only expect 0.5% growth this year. The retail sales forecast for 202-28 is slightly stronger, averaging 1.1% growth per year.
Convenience, sustainability and luxury are growing areas of consumer demand Germany has a mature consumer market, relatively high average incomes and a steadily ageing population. The main characteristics of the grocery sector are its high concentration among four major retailers and comparatively low food prices (in regional terms), owing to a large and competitive discount sector. A major focus of grocery (and other) retailers in recent years has been revising store formats and services in response to growing digitisation and consumer demand for convenience-trends that were reinforced by the pandemic. This process will continue through the expansion of cashier-free and 24-hour stores, "scan and go" purchases, click-and-collect services, and online grocery delivery (or quick commerce). In addition to convenience, consumer demand will continue to grow for products that are sustainable; for ethnic, organic and local products; and for the expanding luxury segment. Online marketplaces will evolve in 2024--28, amid new e-commerce taxation and increased regulatory scrutiny. Online sales were hit by falling disposable incomes, declining by about 4.3% per year in 2022-23, but we forecast a recovery of about 2% in 2024, with growth strengthening in the remainder of the forecast period. We expect the online share of retail sales to rise gradually, to 18% of total sales by 2028.
Population ageing will influence longer-term spending patterns Demographic and social trends will influence spending patterns in the coming years. The rise in the number of single and two-person households, which now comprise three-quarters of the total, will support sales of white goods. There is also a rising demand for services for older consumers, particularly in the health and tourism sectors.

Initial conditions: Germany is a highly developed social market economy that is unusually export-oriented for its size (exports account for nearly 50% of GDP, versus about 31% in France, 32% in the UK and 11% in the US). More than half of production from sectors such as carmaking, mechanical and plant engineering, chemicals, and medical technology is exported. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), known as the Mittelstand, account for 99% of the total number of companies. A world-famous vocational education system and strong spending on research and development (R&D) underpin the industrial sector. Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, good infrastructure and stable institutions. Moreover, the structural shift away from manufacturing and towards services has been less pronounced in Germany than in other OECD members, with a strong outlook for services linked to the industrial sector.
The demographic outlook will prove the biggest drag on long-term growth Demographic trends: Germany's demographics will weigh on growth in the long-term period, with the total population set to shrink by an annual average of 0.2% in 2024-50, and the working-age population set to decline at an even more rapid rate of 0.6% per year. The retirement age is gradually being raised to 67 by 2031, but the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) has ruled out any further increase. Efforts to increase the participation rate are more likely to focus on tightening the conditions for long-term unemployment benefits and bringing more women, immigrants, lower-skilled and older workers into the active labour force. The negative rate of natural change in the population will continue to be slightly offset by positive immigration, with further liberalisation of immigration rules for highly skilled workers from non-EU countries possible. Policy will remain more welcoming to refugees and immigrants from central and eastern Europe than those from the Middle East or Africa, given cultural similarities.
External conditions: As an export-oriented country, Germany stands to lose significantly from the slow erosion of the liberal international trade order, and its attempts to push for reform at the World Trade Organisation have not been successful. Germany has so far suffered less than other developed countries (such as Italy) from competition from emerging markets, such as China and India, owing to its specialisation in high-technology capital goods. However, Chinese companies are increasingly able to compete with German firms in sophisticated industrial manufacturing, which is driving a growing focus in Germany on digitalisation and innovation (Industry 4.0), and, belatedly, on the move to electric mobility. Germany will gradually reduce its economic reliance on China, in line with the EU's de-risking policy, but this will be a much less decisive shift than in the US. There are significant German manufacturing investments in China, and many companies are still placing the growing Chinese market at the core of their investment strategies. Within the EU the liberalisation of services trade will continue, but slowly.
Rising investment and structural reforms will support productivity Institutions and policy trends: Low growth in the early 2000s focused the minds of politicians and policymakers on the need for economic reforms, many of which were implemented, along with more flexible bargaining on wages and other working conditions. These changes have put Germany at an advantage in the region more recently. EIU expects that national and EU initiatives will continue to strengthen productivity, with continued domestic efforts to reduce regulatory barriers and to make financing easier for innovative new firms. Greater investment in infrastructure and digitalisation in the coming years will help to make up for recent shortfalls in spending driven by an overwhelming focus on fiscal probity, and will support economic growth. Public debt increased sharply during the pandemic but remains manageable; reforms to the pension system to make the public finances sustainable in the long term are, however, not yet in sight.
Long-term performance: Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate (2024-50) is 1.2%. A falling working-age population is the main driver of this slowdown; total factor productivity and capital spending will still support growth. The picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with growth of real GDP per head averaging 1.4% in 2024-50. GDP per head in 2050 will therefore come to US$124,190, ahead of the UK and France but behind the US. In terms of the size of the German economy overall as measured by nominal GDP (US$), we expect it to fall from the third-largest economy in the world now to the sixth largest by 2050, owing to stronger growth in Asia. The German economy is currently only smaller than the US and China, but by 2050 we forecast that it will be behind China, the US, India, Indonesia and Japan.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The Energiewende, or energy transition, which focuses on expanding renewable energy and reducing Germany's carbon footprint, has been a critical element of the country's energy policy for the past decade. With The Greens now in government, an agreement has been reached to accelerate the energy transition, raising the target for the share of renewables in power generation to 80% by 2030. In 2023 a milestone was reached, with the majority of net electricity generation (60%) now coming from renewable energy sources (including nuclear). Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced a revision of Germany's energy policies, given the country's historically heavy reliance on gas imports from Russia. This put energy sovereignty and diversification at the forefront of energy policy, replacing Russian natural gas imports with liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, while accelerating renewable energy adoption. To bolster energy provision a temporary measure was made to reactivate up to 8 GW of coal-power capacity in 2022. Nevertheless, coal energy remains in structural decline, and the government has already shut down 15 coal plants in 2024, with four more planned later in the year (Germany continued to operate about 58 coal-power plants in total in mid-2023). In addition, in June 2024 the EU approved a EUR1.75bn payment to the energy company LEAG (which supplies about 10% of total coal energy in Germany) to aid its decarbonisation initiatives. These efforts will support the government's goal of a total coal-power phase-out by 2038, particularly if more coal exit deals are agreed and if the EU's carbon pricing becomes more expensive.
Germany plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65% from 1990 levels by 2030, reaching climate neutrality by 2045. Total carbon emissions fell by 10% in 2023. Although the government expects to meet its 2030 target, climate advisors have warned that energy-intensive industries, such as construction and transport, will struggle to meet the goals. The authorities have taken measures to streamline approval processes for solar and onshore wind projects, while increasing subsidies for solar power. Germany aims to become a global leader in green hydrogen (hydrogen produced solely with renewable energies), with an ambitious national hydrogen strategy announced in 2020, followed by a bill in 2024 expediting hydrogen infrastructure by facilitating permit procedures and reducing legal hurdles.
Although public support for emissions reduction is generally high, frictions are emerging. Closing coal-fired power stations will have a disproportionate impact on parts of eastern Germany where jobs are scarce and support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which denies human responsibility for climate change, is well established. Broader political support for the energy transition is also waning, in line with the falling popularity of The Greens.
Germany's exposure to the impact of climate change will remain comparatively low, given its geographical position, with limited coastal areas and a temperate climate. However, in recent years changes in rainfall patterns have led to low water levels in the Rhine (an important river for goods transportation), and in 2024 flash floods destroyed houses and infrastructure in the southern part of the country, forcing thousands to flee. Drought risks have remained elevated since 2018, and higher levels of climate unpredictability will continue to affect businesses and people. We expect the government to remain willing to provide the infrastructure upgrades necessary in the face of more extreme weather patterns in the future, although in the short term construction firms will struggle with capacity constraints. Supply-chain risk may increase as countries on which the export-oriented German economy depends are damaged by climate change.
Technological developments Technological advancements will have a significant effect on Germany over the long term for a number of reasons. First, the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher there than in most other developed European countries, with industry accounting for almost 30% of the economy. According to the OECD, manufacturing is the sector most exposed to automation globally (along with agriculture), and jobs in Germany (as well as in central and eastern Europe, and Japan) are easier to automate than those in the UK, the US, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Second, Germany is typically strong at research and development (R&D) and innovation, which could make a transition to higher automation rates both more likely and quicker. In 2022 Germany spent 3.1% of GDP on R&D, among the highest rates in the EU (the average was 2.2%), but slightly behind Belgium, Sweden and Austria. The government aims to increase R&D spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2025-a highly ambitious target. Germany also filed 12.5% of all patents at the European Patent Office in 2023, the second-highest share in the world, after the US with 24%.
Third, Germany is already starting from a strong position. In 2022 it was ranked by the International Federation of Robotics as the third most highly automated country in the world, after South Korea and Singapore. Robot density increased to 415 robots per 10,000 workers in 2022, with Germany accounting for 37% of all industrial robots in Europe, and efforts to embed new technologies (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning) across the industrial sector will continue over the long term. This is likely to be disruptive for the automotive sector in particular as e-mobility gains pace. It is also likely to prove difficult for the Mittelstand, the often family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) found across the country that are central to Germany's manufacturing prowess, as they may struggle to acquire the digital skills needed to compete with new challengers. Nevertheless, SMEs demonstrate considerable innovation capability, accounting for 32% of Germany's innovation expenditure and 35% of total R&D spending. Efforts to make these firms more resilient to digital disruption will gain pace in 2024-50, including policies to lower immigration barriers for skilled workers from non-EU countries in high innovation sectors. Although the country will not supplant the US as a leader in innovation, adoption of new technology will be consistently strong.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite its role in fomenting Venezuela's socioeconomic crisis, EIU expects the civic-military regime, led by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to retain power in the 2024-28 forecast period. Mr Maduro's firm control over the country's institutions will support his position, as will his ability to use repression and intervene in the electoral process to hinder the opposition from making inroads into the political system. The regime manages internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces. In terms of foreign policy, Venezuela will seek to strengthen its strategic relationships with authoritarian countries-such as China, Russia, Cuba and Iran-but will otherwise remain geopolitically isolated, as we believe that the upcoming July 28th presidential election will be neither free nor fair.

- Our business environment rankings model puts Venezuela as the world's least attractive investment location in both the historical period (2019-23) and the forecast period (2024-28). The country's score improves modestly in the forecast period, owing to a more stable macroeconomic environment and some partial liberalisation reforms. However, burdensome regulations, an unfair playing field that benefits state-owned firms and a small domestic market decimated from the 2014-20 economic depression will continue to hurt the investment climate. Although the Maduro regime has warmed up to private investment (out of necessity rather than conviction), US sanctions and lingering macroeconomic distortions will continue to act as a drag on growth prospects.

- Although the implementation of piecemeal liberalisation measures will help to engender a higher degree of macroeconomic stability compared with previous years, the overall business environment will remain abysmal. After a full-year contraction in 2023, we expect the economy to grow by 3.6% this year, aided by temporary relief from US sanctions, before softening to a tepid annual average of 2.6% in 2025-28. High outward migration, a dearth of private-sector credit, reimposed US sanctions and weak confidence in the rule of law will continue to weigh on the outlook for the Venezuelan economy. Weak confidence in underlying policymaking means that the regime will struggle to rid itself of the vestiges of hyperinflation and depression, such as an incomplete process of dollarisation, widespread labour informality, and archaic infrastructure.

- Venezuela's population has declined in recent years, as the political and economic crisis has led to outward migration: more than 7.7m Venezuelans are estimated to have left since 2014. We forecast that outward migration will continue in the forecast period (albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of the crisis), given persistent goods shortages and the lack of job opportunities. Despite this exodus of millions of working-age Venezuelans, the old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards. However, population ageing will put increasing strain on the heavily indebted social security system, particularly against the backdrop of precarious public finances.

- Venezuela's 2014-20 hyperinflation-riddled depression has led to a deep crisis that will significantly limit market opportunities: poverty and unemployment have surged as incomes have collapsed. Acute economic inequality will also curb opportunities in the consumer market. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, a high degree of legal and policy uncertainty will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

- Assuming that international oil prices remain supportive, we expect Venezuela's recovery to continue over the long-term forecast period (2024-50). Macroeconomic mismanagement and vulnerability to shocks will keep real GDP growth meagre until 2030, at just 2.5% per year, but we forecast that growth will accelerate to 3.8% in 2031-50, based on our sanguine assumption that successor governments will gradually put forward structural reforms to the oil sector and the business environment. Capital and labour are also likely to contribute to growth (as the skills base and capital stock are gradually rebuilt). However, productivity growth will be disappointing, as structural barriers will prevent the rapid adoption of new technologies.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and rampant corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to oust him from power, before his death in March 2013, failed. His chosen successor, Nicolás, has seen his own popularity plummet, as his macroeconomic mismanagement-aggravated by wide-ranging US sanctions-has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically dismantled institutional checks and balances. In August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) granted itself control over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly, which had been under opposition control since December 2015. The ANC was dissolved at end-2020, after the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged. The judiciary lacks effective autonomy and is composed of regime loyalists.
Policy issues: Following a deep depression in 2014-20, the most pressing policy issue is the need to smooth macroeconomic volatility and spur GDP growth. The monetisation of vast public deficits created an excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Concurrently, mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of almost all foreign-currency inflows into the country) and US sanctions on the energy sector that have been in place since 2019 have caused a sharp contraction in oil production. Incremental pro-market reforms, including dollarisation, have brought some stability, enabling the economy to return to growth in early 2024. However, major macroeconomic and monetary distortions, a lack of confidence in the legal framework and wide-ranging US sanctions continue to limit the extent to which domestic economic policy can drive more robust growth.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 16%. In May 2024 Congress passed a new tax of up to 15% on private-sector payments to workers (including salaries and bonuses).
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$11.1bn in 2016 (the last year of official data), owing to a long-term decline in oil exports. EIU estimates that the surplus fell further in 2023, to just over US$1bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República, has been in power since 1999 and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006. The populist-nationalist PSUV was led by Hugo Chávez from 1999 until his death in 2013; since then the party has been led by the president, Nicolás Maduro. While in power the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested authority, initially owing to Mr Chávez's large popularity, and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and exclude them from state institutions. Against this backdrop, EIU believes that Mr Maduro will win re-election easily on July 28th, with a significant risk that he will stay in power beyond 2030, when his third mandate would be due to end. However, continued regime interference in the electoral process means that we do not expect the international community to accept the result of the election, which will exacerbate Venezuela's isolation on the global stage. Mr Maduro's legitimacy was already contested after winning re-election in 2018 in widely questioned polls, which prompted the leader of the opposition coalition, Juan Guaidó, to declare himself interim president in 2019. This attempt to delegitimise the regime both domestically and internationally largely failed, although a number of countries (including the US) and multilateral institutions (such as the IMF) do not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate president. With Mr Guaidó now in exile, the opposition coalition Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD) appointed Edmundo González, a little-known former ambassador, as its candidate in the election after the regime prevented other candidates from running, including the highly popular María Corina Machado. Looking ahead we expect the PSUV to retain its supermajority in Congress in the next legislative election, scheduled for 2025. The PSUV and its allies currently hold 243 out of 277 seats. Alianza Democrática, a coalition that was set up for the 2020 legislative election and includes many of the parties that are in the PUD, has only 20 seats.

Political outlook: Political stability The July 28th presidential election is approaching, and we expect Mr Maduro to secure a third consecutive term. Notwithstanding high voter frustration fuelled by years of government repression and economic hardship, Mr Maduro is unlikely to face any meaningful threat to his hold on power. This reflects his unchecked authority over all branches of government, as well as an ingrained patronage structure that rewards high-ranking officials and punishes dissent.
Mr Maduro has shrugged off pressure from the PUD for a free and fair vote in July and has brazenly backtracked on commitments that he made in Barbados last year, when he signed a landmark deal pledging to avoid violence, open up the process to international observers and respect the outcome.
Earlier this year, for example, the regime-controlled Supreme Court banned the most popular opposition figure, Ms Machado of the PUD, from holding public office for 15 years, effectively blocking her from running for president. Her substitute, Corina Yoris, was also unable to represent the PUD, when a disorderly registration process prevented the coalition from registering her before the deadline. The PUD then formally backed its third candidate, Mr González, a little-known former ambassador, who was able to register minutes before the deadline expired in March. Although Mr González lacks the popular appeal of Ms Machado, most opposition figures (including Ms Machado) have rallied round his candidacy, making for a fairly strong and united opposition. As the race draws nearer, we believe that Mr Maduro will step up interventions in the electoral process, or even manipulate the results on election day, to deny a possible opposition victory.
Looking ahead, there is a high risk that Mr Maduro will stay in office beyond 2030 (when his probable next term would be due to end) owing to his strict control over the security forces and the absence of democratic counterweights in Venezuela. However, the Maduro regime will still have to contend with the latent risk of social unrest in the face of its ongoing repression of political opponents and their supporters. Widespread dissatisfaction over the weak economy is another potential trigger for turmoil. The recent reinstatement of US sanctions-which had been temporarily lifted in October-April in response to Mr Maduro's democratisation promises in Barbados-is likely to weigh on the incipient recovery.
Another challenge facing the Maduro regime is to establish control over a precarious security situation involving gangs in urban centres, as well as Colombian rebels in border areas. Although these groups lack the resources to oust the regime, they will still hinder the enforcement of law and order, putting political stability at risk.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Venezuela will retain the weakest political and institutional framework in the region in the 2024-28 forecast period. PSUV rule has fuelled corruption and eroded institutional effectiveness, owing largely to the dismantling of institutional checks on the executive branch. Concerns about the credibility of the country's institutions, and about a lack of accountability and transparency will persist. Extensive graft and cronyism in the provision of welfare schemes will also curb political and policy effectiveness. Similarly, PDVSA (the state-owned oil company) is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders and will continue to be run by army personnel, rather than by professional technocrats.
Drug-trafficking will remain a cause for concern, as criminal networks are well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Another worrisome issue is the high rate of violent crime, largely perpetrated by gangs in large urban centres including the capital, Caracas. Although homicide rates have fallen in recent years, Venezuela remains one of the most violent countries in Latin America; the country's murder rate stood at 26.8 per 100,000 people in 2023, the highest in South America. Aside from elevated homicides, high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas have fuelled concerns about bribery and mismanagement in the police. Crime will remain high in the absence of measures to reduce impunity, boost youth employment and-above all-to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system.
Even in the event of a political transition (not our baseline forecast), there would be little progress on addressing Venezuela's political and institutional weaknesses within the forecast period, as approving numerous structural frameworks and eliminating vested interests would require considerable political capital, which would probably be in short supply. A new government would be constrained on the one hand by public calls to punish corruption in the Maduro administration, and on the other hand by the practical need to preserve at least some of the regime's bureaucratic apparatus, given that the opposition has not been in power for more than two decades. Furthermore, a political transition could exacerbate problems such as violent crime, which is fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement bodies. The issue could be aggravated further by attempts by a future government to disband colectivos (armed pro-PSUV civilian groups), as they would probably continue to operate as gangs under a future government.
Political outlook: Election watch The next presidential election is due on July 28th and the next legislative election in 2025. Most polls indicate that Mr González is leading in voting intention and that he would beat Mr Maduro by a landslide. According to a survey conducted in April by Datincorp (a local pollster), 50% of respondents said that they would vote for Mr González, compared with Mr Maduro's tepid 18%. Even so, we maintain our view that the upcoming election will be neither free nor fair. With the Barbados deal all but dead and US sanctions relief over, Mr Maduro will be free to resort to outright fraud and other forms of electoral interference to hold on to power.
Political outlook: International relations US policy towards Venezuela has been less aggressive under the current president, Joe Biden, than under his predecessor, Donald Trump (2017-21), as demonstrated by the October-April period of sanctions relief. Although a second Trump administration does not form part of our baseline forecast, US-Venezuela tensions would escalate in this scenario and possibly result in stiffer sanctions against the Maduro regime from 2025, dampening the incipient recovery of the Venezuelan economy.
Relations between Venezuela and neighbouring Guyana remain delicate. In late 2023 the regime held a controversial referendum on Venezuela's historical claim to the oil-rich Essequibo region of Guyana, with voters, and even prominent opposition figures, broadly in support of the regime using any means necessary to annex the territory. This raised concerns about a potential war with Guyana, but tensions have started to de-escalate following bilateral meetings at which the Venezuelan and Guyanese authorities committed to avoid violence. Against this backdrop, we believe that a direct military conflict is unlikely, although the regime will continue sabre-rattling and using its territorial claim over Essequibo to rally popular support in the run-up to the election, which will sustain the risk that potential regime miscalculations trigger a war with Guyana.
In the meantime, the government's crackdown on dissent will attract rebukes from many countries in the region. Even long-term allies such as Brazil and Colombia have taken the rare step of criticising Mr Maduro after the regime impeded several opposition figures from registering for the election earlier this year. A withering of Venezuela's ties with both countries would be highly detrimental in the light of Venezuela's economic, security and humanitarian linkages with Colombia and the diplomatic leverage that Brazil can provide. We believe that the regime will have to accept a further loss of credibility on the global stage, assuming that the upcoming election will be neither free nor fair. This will leave Mr Maduro with little option other than to move closer to other authoritarian regimes such as China, Russia and Iran.

Overview: Venezuela is the worst performer among all 82 geographies that EIU covers in its business environment rankings. Although Venezuela's position improves modestly in the 2024-28 forecast period-as we expect an economic recovery following a hyperinflation-riddled depression in 2014-20-US sanctions, a legacy of state intervention in the economy and the erosion of the rule of law will continue to pose significant operating risks to firms.
Strengths: The Venezuelan regime has carried out piecemeal liberalisation measures in recent years. It has eased currency and price controls, allowed informal dollarisation to expand, and tightened fiscal and monetary policy. These policies have helped to narrow the fiscal deficit and reduce the pace of currency weakening, supporting greater price stability. Indeed, annual inflation returned to the double digits in February 2024 for the first time in 15 years.
Weaknesses: Venezuela's abysmal business environment reflects the absence of democratic counterweights, burdensome regulations, a dismantling of the legal framework to investors and a corrupt, poorly managed state-led model, which hampers private competition and deters foreign capital. Physical infrastructure will remain archaic and will deteriorate further as the government fails to invest in the transport, water and electricity systems. The labour market will suffer from a loss of skilled labour, given that close to 8m people have left Venezuela since the socioeconomic crisis began in 2014.
What to watch
- Following a six-month relief period, the US reinstated economic sanctions on Venezuela in April 2024 in response to the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, violating its promises to ensure a level playing field ahead of the July 2024 presidential election. There is still a high risk that the US will impose tougher sanctions on the regime from 2025, especially if the former president, Donald Trump (2017-21), returns to the US presidency.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Government relaxes price controls further. Graft and discriminatory application of regulations are common, undermining free competition.
2026-28: Contract rights remain weak; red tape and state interventionism continue to hurt sentiment towards Venezuela, keeping investment below potential.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: US sanctions and weak confidence in rule of law remain major deterrents to foreign investment, despite some token liberalisation efforts made by government.
2026-28: Speculative purchases of Venezuelan assets continue. Intellectual property protection and private property rights remain weak.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Government stops enforcing most exchange controls, but access to foreign currency remains limited. Regional allies dial back support for the regime, owing to probable evidence of fraud in July 28th election, hurting foreign trade.
2026-28: Government extends tariff exemptions on imports to address continued domestic goods shortages.
Taxes 2024-25: Government explores options to broaden the tax base, but high levels of informality and tax evasion delay progress.
2026-28: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2024-25: Shallow domestic capital markets mean that only short-term financing is available.
2026-28: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2024-25: Disinflation and a slower pace of currency depreciation support private consumption, although real wages remain among lowest by regional and global standards. Emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2026-28: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increased flexibility in hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2024-25: La Niña fuels weather-related volatility, impairing water network and electricity grid. Prolonged power outages, owing to adverse climate incidents hobble business operations.
2026-28: US sanctions deter investors from committing to long-term capital projects. Adverse weather events continue to impair infrastructure.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Private digital services expand to fill vacuums in domestic markets, mainly in fintech and e-commerce.
2026-28: Government makes efforts to expand 5G access, but internet and mobile coverage is limited following years of underinvestment.

Overview: Venezuela remains the least attractive macroeconomic environment of all 82 geographies that we cover. On a positive note, the score for this category improves in the forecast period, owing to an expected recovery from a contraction in 2014-20 that shaved off more than three-quarters of GDP. Nevertheless, our modest average annual growth rate forecast of 2.8% for 2024-28 will not be enough to make up for the loss of output during the depression, or to significantly reduce the economy's vulnerability to shocks. US sanctions, a legacy of state intervention in the economy and limited structural reforms will continue to weigh on the macroeconomic environment.
Strengths: A major area of improvement in the macroeconomic environment will be the public finances, which will benefit from a narrower budget deficit as election-related spending falls and the Maduro regime takes firmer steps towards fiscal consolidation. On this basis, we believe that the government will continue to dial back price and currency controls, while benefiting from stronger growth in tax revenue as the economy recovers. Another positive factor is that Venezuela's improved inflation dynamics and more modest pace of currency depreciation will support consumer spending on goods and services, keeping a floor under economic growth.
Weaknesses: The scale of state interventionism will make it difficult to undo the myriad of distortions across the economy. Although the authorities have made strides towards price and currency stability, the country is still highly vulnerable to external, as well as domestic demand shocks, as evidenced by a full-year GDP contraction in 2023, which followed an inflation spike that began in late 2022. In addition, the reimposition of US sanctions in April 2024 means that the Maduro regime will again be forced to sell its oil through intermediaries at a hefty discount, curbing export revenue.
What to watch
- Most recent polls indicate that Mr Maduro is trailing his main rival, Edmundo González of the Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD, a ten-party opposition coalition) by a wide margin. As a result, we believe that Mr Maduro will manipulate the results on July 28th to ensure his continued hold on power. If the results are considered fraudulent, investor sentiment towards Venezuela could deteriorate further, triggering foreign capital outflows and substantial currency depreciation, to the detriment of the macroeconomic environment.
- The Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) has pursued strict monetary tightening in order to contain inflation. However, this has come at the cost of a highly restrictive 73% reserve requirement on the banking system since 2022, which has constrained credit growth and dampened economic dynamism. The BCV has so far resisted calls to ease the reserve requirement and we expect it to continue doing so at least until the economy is on a more solid footing for sustained growth.

Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for policy towards private enterprise and competition is still extremely weak, but it rises from a low base, causing the country to jump up four positions in the global ranking and one position in the regional ranking. The improvement primarily reflects the government's liberalisation efforts, in particular with respect to the rollback of several price and currency controls, as well as the fact that it has scaled down the monetisation of public deficits. However, the Maduro regime will maintain an erratic and interventionist approach in many areas of policymaking. That, coupled with the erosion of the rule of law and a lack of adequate protection for property rights, will continue to create an adverse environment for private-sector activity to expand.
Strengths: The government has recognised the need to attract private investment, which involves creating a more level playing field between the public and private sectors in the domestic economy. One of the most radical measures has been the re-privatisation of many state-owned assets, from partial equity to full transfers to the private sector. The rollback of some macroeconomic distortions has also helped to spur private-sector activity in areas such as real estate, construction and manufacturing. However, most of this expansion reflects a low base of comparison, given Venezuela's decades-long economic contraction, rather than a sustained shift in the direction of policymaking.
Weaknesses: The private sector has to contend with challenging operating conditions, characterised by rampant corruption, the absence of democratic counterweights and lengthy delays in the enforcement of contracts. Difficulties in access to finance inhibit a more favourable environment for small and medium-sized businesses to emerge. Overall, larger firms that are either state-owned or otherwise closely associated with the regime dominate the economy. As a result of decades of underinvestment in energy infrastructure and inadequate maintenance, businesses also suffer from an intermittent supply of fuels and electricity.
What to watch
- Recent efforts at re-privatisation and the establishment of joint operations have been targeted largely at government insiders and other figures linked to the regime, allowing these actors to derive rents from activities that were once dominated by the state. The government could step up re-privatisation efforts in order to boost investment at a time of flagging growth.
- State capture of the country's institutions means that regulatory bodies are not independent and will primarily benefit state interests. This adds risks to private investors who face weak protection of their property rights. There is a risk that efforts at liberalisation will be rolled back if the regime's authoritarianism is consolidated further after the 2024 election.

Business environment outlook: Policy towards foreign investment                
Value of index a   Global rank b   Regional rank c

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged in the forecast period, resulting in no movement in the regional or global positions either. There have been some efforts to attract foreign investment in recent years, particularly to revive the oil sector, but these have been limited by far-reaching US sanctions, which prevent most oil firms from operating directly in Venezuela or with state-owned companies. Although expropriation risk is lower than in the past, a legacy of state intervention in the economy, as well as widespread labour informality and archaic infrastructure remain major deterrents to foreign investment in the non-oil sector.
Strengths: Since 2020 the government has made some efforts to incentivise private (particularly foreign) investment, in order to compensate for the state's limited ability to meet the country's investment needs. One of the most important moves to this end is an anti-blockade law that includes provisions designed to encourage private-sector investment, including in joint operations with public companies and anonymity for foreign investors to sidestep US sanctions. The government has also created five special economic zones (SEZs) with preferential fiscal regimes, which will help to promote a higher degree of private competition.
Weaknesses: Erratic policymaking, a substandard legal framework that gives preference to state interests and the reinstatement of US sanctions will make it extremely difficult for the Maduro regime to attract foreign investment on a consistent basis. As the government has been in default on its external debt obligations since 2017, firms will not be able to access investment protection schemes. Moreover, the regime has shown reluctance to compensate firms that have been affected by nationalisations in the past. A small domestic market, still decimated from the 2014-20 depression, also offers few attractive opportunities for foreign investment in the non-oil sector.
What to watch
- In 2023 the government announced the SEZs, four of which have since been officially inaugurated (Morón, Paraguaná, Ureña, and the Orinoco Belt). Fiscal benefits will include refunds of income and customs taxes, accelerated depreciation, discounts on port tariffs, and other deductions. However, the mixed success of these projects elsewhere in the region puts into question how effective they will be.
- The Maduro regime has been considering an oil reform bill since 2021 that would allow foreign firms to control majority stakes in new projects. Although the reform appears to be shelved, the government will probably reconsider enacting it after the 2024 election to partly offset the impact of reimposed US sanctions. The government is also pursuing efforts to expand the renewable energy sector, but it remains in its infancy and will require significant foreign assistance to develop.

Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves just enough for it to rise by one position in the global ranking, but the country still slips by one place regionally. Although the relaxation of capital controls, higher export earnings (owing to supportive oil prices) and steady inflows of workers' remittances from abroad will help to increase the availability of US dollars, supply will still fall short of market demand, and businesses' limited access to hard currency will constrain foreign trade. More generally, trade policy will remain inconsistent, and Venezuela will continue to be an unreliable partner, racking up significant debt in unpaid invoices to suppliers, owing to the country's financing constraints.
Strengths: Exchange-rate controls were eased in 2018, when a single currency, the bolívar soberano, superseded the previous dual-currency system, which had engendered a large black market for US dollars. In order to tame hyperinflation, the regime also began a deliberate policy of dollarising the economy, reaching a peak of over 60% of all transactions in dollars in 2022, although this has since fallen to about 40% following the introduction of a foreign currency tax of 3% on large transactions that same year. Despite the tax, individuals and companies can now freely buy or sell foreign currency at private and state-run currency exchanges or banks.
Weaknesses: Foreign trade will continue to suffer from US sanctions, particularly those imposed on the oil sector, which represents Venezuela's main source of foreign revenue (and which in turn is used to finance imports). Venezuela's banking sector has also been a major target of sanctions, making it extremely difficult for the country to get external financing, especially given that Venezuela has been effectively locked out of global bond markets since 2017, owing to its debt default in that year. For the few companies that the US government has exempted from sanctions, payment is made in the form of oil-for-debt swaps, which limits the export revenue that Venezuela can collect.
What to watch
- Dollarisation remains a tricky issue for the regime. The authorities must balance the price stability and confidence afforded by the widespread use of the US dollar with the risk of reduced demand for the local currency, which can fuel inflation given the country's high dependency on imports. We believe that the government will seek to maintain the current level of dollarisation (40%) in the forecast period, owing to Venezuela's improved inflation dynamics and the more stable bolívar.
- The US government has ordered that all US companies that established operations or investments in Venezuela during the six-month sanctions relief period (October 2023-April 2024) must either wind them up or apply for special licences for them to continue. Most of these licences are likely to be afforded on special terms, such as oil-for-debt swaps, which will curb the export revenue from these investments.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for taxes improves moderately in the forecast period, resulting in a one-position rise in the global ranking, but the country remains the poorest performer for this category of all 12 geographies that we cover in Latin America. Although taxes are not particularly onerous and there have been few instances of new or higher taxes being introduced in recent years, the unwieldy and inconsistent tax regime will remain a major barrier to private investment. In theory, Venezuela offers both foreign and domestic investors a full and equal range of investment incentives (now enhanced by the SEZs), special credit financing and export incentives. In practice, however, these do little to encourage investment, owing to other structural impediments.
Strengths: Rates of taxation are moderate and are roughly in line with those in many other Latin American countries. The top personal and corporate income tax rates are set at 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), and value-added tax (VAT) is 16%. Capital gains taxes are set at the same level as income taxes. The inclusion of new taxes, as well as major changes to tax rates, have been relatively rare, although there is a permanent risk that the regime will introduce new taxes arbitrarily. Smaller changes to the tax system, such as adding or removing specific exemptions, are more frequent, however.
Weaknesses: Tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to unexpected modifications. The system is also extremely complex. Businesses must make dozens of separate payments each year to comply with time-consuming tax requirements; Venezuela is about three times worse than the Latin American average in terms of both number of payments and time taken to comply. The effective corporate tax rate is heavy, accounting for 60% of profits in 2024, according to Ecoanalítica (a local think-tank); the regional average is about 29%. There is very little consultation between government and the private business sector on fiscal matters.
What to watch
- The government has recently eliminated a tax exemption scheme that covered over 3,000 products spanning the gamut of consumer, intermediate and capital goods, which were exempt from import tariffs and VAT. This scheme was established in 2021 in order to alleviate domestic goods shortages and was given two annual extensions. We believe that the end of this exemption scheme will help the government raise tax revenue and drive a gradual narrowing of the budget deficit.
- In May 2024 Congress passed a new tax of up to 15% on private-sector payments to workers (including salaries and bonuses), in order to increase the contribution of businesses to the beleaguered pension system. However, the additional tax obligation will raise operating costs for businesses and dampen private-sector profitability in Venezuela, threatening to hinder the country's incipient economic recovery.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for financing improves slightly in the forecast period, but the country remains the poorest performer for this category among all 82 geographies that we cover. The modest improvement for 2024-28 reflects an expected increase in bank lending to the private sector, assuming that the monetary authorities will ultimately embark on a gradual easing cycle as inflationary pressures abate. Nevertheless, Venezuelan corporates and state entities will remain shut out of international financial markets throughout the forecast period, as the sovereign is still in default. Despite recent efforts made by the Maduro regime to restructure as much as US$154bn in defaulted debt, including US$67bn held by private bondholders, we expect any debt reconciliation process to be lengthy and highly complex. Another complicating factor is that US sanctions will prevent Venezuelan debt sales in US markets, hindering negotiations between bondholders and the Maduro regime.
Strengths: Venezuela's financing environment has few strengths, but despite the aggressive monetary-tightening cycle that followed the 2014-20 inflationary spiral, the country broadly avoided a banking crisis similar to those in 1994 and 2009-10, when the government was forced to bail out or take over numerous struggling banks. This resilience is partly due to the large presence of the state in the banking sector (it accounts for nearly two-thirds of assets), and the fact that low levels of lending have helped to avoid a rise in non-performing loans, even in the face of a difficult environment for businesses.
Weaknesses: At 73% since 2022, the official reserve requirement for banks underpins a restrictive monetary policy designed to prevent the money supply from spiralling out of control. However, this has severely limited credit to the private sector, which we estimate to be a meagre 0.3% of GDP (from 20% at the end of 2017, which was already low by regional comparison). What little credit banks provide is mostly in the form of directed lending (mostly to agricultural producers and microenterprises) at preferential rates. Loans from multilateral institutions are the only major source of external lending, but these are primarily directed towards development projects and humanitarian aid.
What to watch
- The private sector is pressuring the government to reduce reserve requirements to promote credit growth, but we only expect this to happen once inflation falls more substantially. Another demand by private enterprises is to allow dollar-denominated credit (currently only dollar-indexed credit is permitted), as they seek to take advantage of the significant proportion of dollar deposits, which account for roughly half of the total.
- Venezuela has been in default since 2017, and US financial sanctions, coupled with official US non-recognition of the Maduro regime, further restrict the ability of bondholders to negotiate with the Venezuelan government. Nevertheless, the Maduro regime sent a positive signal to investors in early 2024 by hiring Rothschild & Co (a France-based financial advisory company) to help restructure its huge debt pile.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Although the labour market is the strongest category of Venezuela's business environment, the country still ranks poorly by global and regional standards; it falls to the worst position in Latin America and slips one place globally in 2024-28. The score reflects major skills shortages in the labour market following a mass exodus of almost 8m Venezuelans (mostly of working age) since 2014. Many of those who have left the country are skilled workers who are unlikely to return until the economy is on a much firmer footing, if at all. The informal sector is large and employs nearly 60% of the country's labour force. Rigid labour laws deter formalisation, although wage regulation is lax and supports the labour market score.
Strengths: Labour costs, particularly for businesses that operate primarily in foreign currency, are low, following a collapse in real wages during the 2014-20 hyperinflation crisis. Likewise, living costs in Venezuela are favourable for workers who earn in foreign currency, which helps to make up for other drawbacks, such as poor services and high levels of urban crime. Despite massive outward migration in recent years, there is still a relatively large pool of educated workers; according to the latest data from UNESCO, the mean length of schooling stands at 11.1 years, higher than in large economies like Brazil (8.1), Mexico (9.2) and Colombia (8.9).
Weaknesses: The labour market will remain extremely inflexible, which will exacerbate shortages and incentivise informality. Staffing levels (other than for managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements, which typically take the form of extremely generous severance payments that add to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers-a factor that workers and union representatives use to their advantage.
What to watch
- The minimum wage has remained stagnant since March 2022, when it was set at BsD130 per month (equivalent to US$30 at the time but just US$3.6 currently). In May 2024 the government announced a raise in the ingreso mensual íntegro, a monthly bonus that is partly composed of food vouchers, but the remainder is only applicable to certain workers registered in the Patria platform, which has been accused of being used for government monitoring.
- The government's resistance to raise the minimum wage has resulted in outbreaks of social unrest from unions and public-sector workers who have traditionally been among the regime's closest allies. Many public-sector workers remain grossly underpaid and private wages are currently outpacing those in the public sector. Government crackdowns on protesters (including the arrests of union leaders) have further decreased support from these sectors.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: The score for infrastructure strengthens slightly in 2024-28 on the back of a modest improvement in broadband connection speed, owing to stronger imports of technology goods (particularly from China), but Venezuela falls by one position in the global ranking and remains the poorest performer regionally. Venezuela's infrastructure remains archaic following years of underinvestment. The lack of funds to carry out even routine maintenance and sustain basic service provision manifests itself most clearly in prolonged power, water, and petrol shortages. Multilateral assistance will remain limited in 2024-28, assuming that US sanctions remain in place, which will force Venezuela to rely on allies like China, Russia and Iran to assist in bringing idle infrastructure back on stream.
Strengths: The road network is one of the Venezuela's strongest infrastructure assets, accounting for the bulk of passenger and cargo transport. Moreover, the country has adequate port facilities to handle large volumes of crude exports and other cargo. The Maiquetía International Airport in Caracas handles most of the country's air freight, but other regional airports are small and poorly maintained.
Weaknesses: A combination of fiscal constraints and US sanctions means that it is difficult to attract long-term investment in infrastructure projects. There is considerable mismanagement and corruption in the enforcement of contracts. Despite the importance of the oil sector, there have been persistent petrol shortages in recent years, owing to the country's idle refining capacity; the higher costs of processing Venezuela's heavy crude further exacerbate these shortages. The six-month period of US sanctions relief was not long enough to promote any major foreign-financed infrastructure project.
What to watch
- Venezuela is highly vulnerable to drought risks, given the country's dependence on hydroelectricity production, particularly from the Guri Dam, which generates about half of Venezuela's energy. These risks may be compounded by changes in climate conditions, especially if a strong La Niña phenomenon were to arrive in the second half of 2024. A fall in reservoir levels could lead to prolonged power outages and cause significant disruption to business operations.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for technological readiness improves slightly in the forecast period, which results in a rise of two positions in the global ranking and one in the regional ranking. In recent years government programmes have driven an expansion of the digital market. The Maduro regime has encouraged the spread of cyber-cafés, as well as publicly funded connection centres and wider availability of bundle packages, driving a modest increase in internet usage. However, Venezuela's score for technological readiness remains among the poorest in the world, as the country's dire economic situation produces knock-on effects for its telecoms sector; there is little private investment, and the few businesses operating in Venezuela have to contend with significant government intervention and regulatory hurdles, as well as severe and prolonged blackouts that have at times left up to 90% of the country without internet access.
Strengths: Venezuela was one of the region's earliest adopters of mobile telephony, and mobile-phone penetration overtook fixed-line penetration earlier than in most other Latin American countries. Although mobile-phone penetration fell to an estimated 66.7 per 100 people in 2024, compared with a peak of 103.6 per 100 people in 2012, disinflation will support real incomes and lift consumer demand for mobile phones in 2024-28, which will drive a gradual recovery in penetration rates.
Weaknesses: Although the Maduro regime will continue to emphasise its commitment to promoting the use of WiFi technology to expand internet access, in practice it will lack the funds to do so. The weak state of the domestic economy, coupled with US sanctions and a lack of confidence in the rule of law, will also deter the scale of private investment that is needed to engender robust and sustainable growth in the technology sector.
What to watch
- With the Maduro regime on a firmer fiscal footing, there are plans to invest more heavily in tech-related areas such as research and development (R&D), university laboratories and scientific-talent hunting. This is largely based on an import-substitution model, in order to reduce dependency on foreign technology. However, financing constraints, coupled with the country's meagre existing R&D base, suggest that these plans will have little impact over the medium to long term.
- The government is planning to hold a tender for 5G spectrum and to phase out legacy systems like 2G by 2025 (most mobile traffic is fairly evenly split between 3G and 4G). This is part of a relatively ambitious national telecoms plan, which also involves an expansion of the fibre-optic network, internet exchange points and data centres.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Policymaking under the president, Nicolás Maduro, will lack credibility and consistency, and Venezuela's nascent economic recovery will remain vulnerable to setbacks. The country fell back into recession last year, but it will level out to consistent if unspectacular annual growth averaging 2.6% in 2025-28 following a strong bounce-back in 2024 amid a firmer disinflation process and a more stable local currency. The government will make some progress in lifting oil production, but it will struggle to revive the non-oil economy, given the lack of economic diversification and weak productivity following decades of underinvestment. A long-standing reliance on consumer and capital imports financed by oil revenue had left the country with a poor industrial base, even before the economy began to contract in 2014. Those businesses that have survived the years of hyperinflation, red tape and burdensome government regulations have had to reduce staffing levels, increase their use of informal practices and ultimately contend with weaker profits. The temporary boost stemming from US sanctions relief (which started in October but expired in April) has given the energy sector an important reprieve in the immediate term, in the light of the increase in foreign investment and other forms of business transactions carried out during late 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. However, the boost will not extend into 2025-28, as EIU expects US sanctions to remain in place in the foreseeable future.
On a positive note, the government has gradually shifted away from its previous statist and interventionist approach by implementing piecemeal liberalisation measures in recent years. It has dialled back most price and currency controls, allowed informal dollarisation to expand and continuously narrowed the fiscal deficit. It has even sought to privatise some state-owned assets, albeit with partial success. Nonetheless, all these moves reflect economic necessity rather than policy conviction, and we do not believe that the government will be willing to undertake the structural economic and institutional reforms that are required to put Venezuela back on a firmer economic footing.

Government debt 318.3 326.7 334.6 330.4 320.5 313.5
Although the authorities have not published fiscal data since 2011, figures on monetary aggregates and private-sector reporting indicate that fiscal policy has tightened sharply in recent years. The currently high oil price environment will buoy export receipts and give the Maduro regime some leeway to avoid harsh spending cuts this year-an especially welcome development in an election year. We therefore expect the deficit to narrow slightly, from an estimated 4.4% of GDP in 2023 to 4% of GDP this year, which is still wide given the scale of fiscal consolidation that is needed to stabilise Venezuela's large public debt/GDP ratio, which we estimate at 318.3% in 2023.
Fiscal performance will largely hinge on the oil industry; if production remains tepid, the deficit could be wider than we forecast. Moreover, widespread business and labour informality will hinder tax collection, despite recent regime measures to increase revenue by imposing additional taxes on private-sector payments to workers (including salaries and bonuses).
Over the medium term we expect the government to continue spending on wages, pensions and fixed investment to prop up the economy, but it will pare back spending on subsidies and federal transfers. As a result, the fiscal deficit is forecast to narrow, although it will still be large, at 3.2% of GDP in 2028, as US sanctions and falling oil prices (particularly from 2025) will curb growth in oil receipts.
Meanwhile, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain burdensome, averaging 325.1% per year throughout the 2024-28 forecast period. Although high inflation has reduced the real value of outstanding domestic debt, currency depreciation has raised external debt-servicing costs. A sovereign default in 2017, in addition to US sanctions on the financial sector, means that the regime will have virtually no access to financing other than from the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank).

Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 10.3 14.1 15.2 11.9 10.5 11.1
The BCV will be slow to loosen monetary policy in 2024-28 as it seeks to keep monetary aggregates under sufficient control to ward off another inflationary spiral. The central bank's preferred policy instrument is the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which has stood at about 73% since 2022. Meanwhile, the BCV's average overnight interbank rate fell to 30.8% in April, compared with the 2023 average of 61.4%, indicating that liquidity constraints on banks are easing. However, low levels of financialisation and credit mean that monetary policy has limited pass-through effects on the economy. Moreover, directed lending rules and interest-rate caps will limit transmission from the interbank rate to lending rates. Elevated lending rates, along with the high CRR, will stifle private-sector credit, which is unlikely to rise much above its current low level of 1% of GDP.
After rising in 2023, dollarisation levels have fallen modestly this year, as the more stable bolívar encouraged greater use of the local currency. As at February 2024, an estimated 32.7% of transactions were made in US dollars, down from about 50% at end-2023. We expect dollarisation to remain close to its current level throughout our forecast period as greater confidence in the bolívar supports its use among the population.

After a 1.2% contraction in 2023, real GDP growth is forecast to recover this year and expand by 3.6%, mostly reflecting the temporary boost for the oil industry-and positive spillover effects into the non-oil sector-stemming from the period of sanctions relief in October-April. A slightly more favourable macroeconomic environment, characterised by cooling inflation and a slower pace of currency depreciation, will also prop up the economy, via stronger private consumption growth. Further ahead, we forecast that economic growth will soften to an annual average of only 2.6% in 2025-28 as reimposed US sanctions dampen investment and export volumes; a myriad of enduring macroeconomic distortions and limited structural reforms also contribute to the weak outlook.
The regime has struggled to lift oil production, which came in at just 860,000 barrels/day in April. We expect oil output to increase modestly, exceeding 1m b/d by the end of our forecast period-a far cry from the typical output of 2m-2.5m b/d over the previous decade. Capacity constraints mean that PDVSA (the state-owned oil firm) needs to bring several new rigs on stream to lift production consistently. There are now only two active drilling rigs in service, compared with a peak of 70 a decade ago. A further obstacle is Venezuela's archaic energy infrastructure following years of underinvestment and inadequate maintenance. The regime is seeking to resolve these issues with technical assistance from Russia and Iran, although progress will be piecemeal, as those partners will lack confidence in PDVSA's debt-servicing ability. PDVSA's cashflow will benefit from elevated oil prices, but the reinstatement of US sanctions will partly offset the gains, as the company will need to sell its oil through intermediaries at a discount (which we estimate at about 20%).
Election-related volatility is a source of downside risk to our GDP growth forecast in the near term, and political stability risks will affect economic performance into the medium term. Growth could also come in lower than our forecasts if oil production fails to pick up.
Overall, poor macroeconomic fundamentals, weak institutions, widespread labour informality and a business environment that is not conducive to either risk-taking or long-term planning will curb market opportunities and leave the economy chronically exposed to shocks.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends With proven levels surpassing 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement, owing to political interference and crippling US sanctions. The state has exclusive ownership of PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Since 2007 oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%, which has forced foreign companies to establish joint ventures with PDVSA.
According to the latest data from the International Energy Agency, Venezuelan oil output is in the midst of a modest upswing; production averaged about 860,000 b/d in April 2024, compared with an annual average of 771,000 b/d in 2023. The incipient recovery follows several years of sustained declines caused by severe operational constraints at PDVSA that made it increasingly difficult for the firm to maintain production, let alone invest in exploration in order to lift future capacity. PDVSA's problems worsened significantly from 2017 as a result of US sanctions. Restrictions were tightened in 2019, reducing the pool of potential buyers of Venezuelan crude. This has made Venezuela reliant on exporting via third-party intermediaries in order to evade sanctions, at a sharp discount and often leaving PDVSA at risk of fraud from these intermediaries. Sanctions also exacerbate extant operational difficulties by hindering the imports of diluents that are blended with Venezuela's predominantly heavy and extra-heavy oil.
The recent increase in production mostly reflects the fact that major oil companies like Chevron (US), Eni (Italy) and Repsol (Spain) ramped up their operations in Venezuela during the six-month relief period from US sanctions over October 2023-April 2024. Despite these positive developments for Venezuela's mainstay energy sector, we believe that PDVSA's aim of lifting oil output to 1m b/d by end-2024 is overly optimistic. In theory, PDVSA's cash flows could benefit from supportive oil prices (even considering the discount that the company must offer buyers to compensate for sanctions risk). However, PDVSA has been unable to fully capitalise on the tighter oil market because of logistical bottlenecks, and because of the difficulty and high costs involved in bringing dozens of idle oil rigs back on stream. Given the extremely poor state of Venezuela's oil infrastructure and the fact that US sanctions were reimposed in April 2024, oil output is unlikely to rise significantly in the coming years. As a result, we expect Venezuelan oil production to reach 1.1m b/d by end-2028, a far cry from the typical output of 2m-2.5m b/d over the previous decade.
Lifting production more significantly would require huge private investment, prospects for which will remain poor for as long as US sanctions remain in place. These sanctions are tied to commitments made in Barbados in October 2023 for democratisation reforms and the holding of free and fair elections in 2024, which the regime has manifestly failed to do. As a result, the regime has pursued unconventional means of boosting private investment in the sector, for example through an anti-blockade law that gives the executive considerable powers to establish confidential new deals with private firms and countries. The Maduro regime has also considered reforming the hydrocarbons law so as to abolish the requirement for PDVSA to have at least 50% equity in joint ventures, reduce oil royalties and provide exemptions for municipal taxes. However, we are sceptical about prospects for large-scale investments, given the discretionary legal framework, the abysmal state of local infrastructure and the high costs of doing business.

After peaking at 42.1% in early 2023, monthly inflation eased to 2% in April 2024, mostly reflecting a steadier local currency. However, given that the US has reimposed sanctions, foreign companies will be reluctant to engage with the Maduro regime for fear of incurring the wrath of the US authorities. Increasingly negative investor sentiment towards Venezuela will therefore curb inflows of foreign exchange to the country (or even trigger some short-term capital outflows), exerting new weakening pressures on the bolívar and causing monthly inflation to accelerate in the near term.
Although there is a high degree of uncertainty attached to the long-term trajectory of the bolívar (which influences inflation trends, in the light of the economy's reliance on imports), we believe that partial dollarisation will mitigate the risk of a return to hyperinflation. Even so, inflationary risks will persist, owing to chronic deficit monetisation, supply shortages and enduring depreciatory pressures on the bolívar, which will keep import costs elevated. As a result, we expect annual inflation (despite cooling from 189.8% at end-2023) to remain very high, ending 2028 at 48.6%.

Bolívar depreciation began to ease in late 2023 and continued to moderate in April, to just 0.3% (compared with 5-10% per month in mid-2023), taking the exchange rate to BsD36.5:US$1 by the end of that month. The BCV has intervened continuously in the currency markets in the form of US dollar sales to support the value of the bolívar, but modest foreign-exchange reserves (US$10bn as at end-April) leave the BCV with limited room for manoeuvre over the medium to long term.
There are significant risks to our view that the bolívar will end the forecast period at BsD358.3:US$1, as the regime's poor debt-service record and the structural vulnerabilities of the economy will sustain investor risk aversion. Confidence would erode further if the US were to impose harsher sanctions on Venezuela (a likely development if the former president, Donald Trump (2017-21), were to win the US presidency this year), potentially intensifying currency depreciation.

A poor policy mix, US sanctions and structural deficiencies will prevent Venezuela from harnessing the fairly high oil price environment to spur macroeconomic stability. Although gross international reserves have risen in recent years, roughly half of the current levels comprise a US$5.1bn allocation of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) that the authorities cannot access because the Fund has not recognised the Maduro regime since 2019.
Despite a supportive current-account position (owing to high energy prices and subdued import growth), the BCV's misguided currency strategy will prevent reserves from increasing significantly. We expect reserves to rise to just over US$11.1bn (including SDRs) by end-2028-barely a quarter of their pre-crisis peak in 2014. Nevertheless, given the lack of a credible and consistent policy framework, we do not rule out the risk of tighter controls or an outright currency crisis.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela Stocks and flows According to the latest data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$21.9bn in 2022, which is less than half of the peak of US$45.6bn in 2006. This decline can be attributed to significant disinvestment as a result of a poor business climate, economic mismanagement and weak investor protections. Investment plunged after Venezuela fell into depression in 2014. However, given the collapse of GDP after that point, the stock of FDI as a share of GDP has actually risen. FDI outflows jumped in 2019, when the country's political crisis was at its peak and US sanctions were tightened significantly. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable but is dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company. After peaking at US$26.5bn in 2013, the stock of outward FDI has begun to decline modestly, reaching US$25.5bn in 2022, according to UNCTAD.
Origin and distribution The energy sector, and oil in particular, has been the main magnet for FDI in Venezuela. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even following changes to the ownership structure of most contracts that forced firms into joint ventures with PDVSA. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). Owing to wide-ranging US sanctions and restricted access to external finance, short-term efforts will focus on courting investment from China, Russia and Iran, although success will be fairly limited.
Determinants Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecoms openings, an uncertain political and policy environment (including threats of nationalisation) and a volatile macroeconomic climate have kept FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, under which PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector and private partners must pay high taxes and royalties. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt require substantial technical know-how and huge investment to be put to production-an environment where major oil companies would thrive. US sanctions, which have been particularly severe on the energy sector, also impair investment, as companies that deal with PDVSA face significant restrictions in the US. Venezuela's oil sector would be a major draw for FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies and if US sanctions were lifted, but EIU does not consider either of these changes likely to take place over the medium term.
Impact Foreign investment in oil boosted output growth from 2.4m barrels/day in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output that was also caused by poor management at PDVSA. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing and services, resulting in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential Given the scale of economic mismanagement and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and productive capacity, there is huge potential for investment in Venezuela. Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism, and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example leather goods, cocoa and rum). However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns about the government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment, the fragility of the legal framework, and US sanctions. A recovery in investment is unlikely under the current leader, Nicolás Maduro, as exchange-rate distortions and controls on local prices will remain unaddressed. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, and only if the new government were to engage in structural economic reforms.

High rates of emigration will continue while the Maduro regime is in power Venezuela's population will continue to decline in the 2024-28 forecast period, owing to a falling birth rate and large-scale emigration. Annual population growth has been slowing steadily, from 2.6% in the 1980s to 2.1% in the 1990s and 1.6% in 2000-10. EIU estimates that Venezuela's population declined by an annual average of 2% in the 2019-23 historical period, as a result of the country's deep socioeconomic crisis-a product of a depression that lasted from 2014 until 2020. Looking ahead, we expect the population to continue to shrink, albeit at a more modest pace, averaging a negative 0.5% per year in 2024-28. The UN High Commission for Refugees estimates that more than 7.7m Venezuelans have left the country since the economy began to contract in 2014, and that at least 2.9m of those reside in neighbouring Colombia. Although the Venezuelan economy returned to growth in 2021, it fell back into recession in 2023, and it is a shadow of what it used to be, having contracted by about three-quarters since 2014. Given the dearth of economic opportunities locally, we expect outward migration to persist throughout 2024-28, albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of the crisis. On this basis, we expect the total population to fall to 27.9m by 2028 (from an estimated peak of 31.6m in 2018), with about a quarter of the population aged 14 and under and two-thirds aged 15-64. Population density is low, at 32 people/sq km, according to World Bank estimates from 2021 (latest data available). Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with almost 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure and limited job opportunities in the countryside will result in continuing urbanisation in 2024-28.
Official statistics belie the dire state of the labour market Analysis of the labour market is complicated by a lack of credibility in official statistics. Based on official numbers, the labour force participation rate rose from 70% in 2013 to 73% in 2018 (latest data available). However, these data are at odds with official figures for economic activity, which show that real GDP was in a downward spiral from 2014 until 2020. As a result, we believe that labour force participation has broadly kept declining in recent years (to about 50% in 2023), as deteriorating economic conditions are likely to have discouraged potential job-seekers from entering the market. We believe that the 2014-20 depression-and the associated large-scale emigration-will have had a pronounced and lasting impact on the size of the workforce. As a result, the labour force participation rate will pick up only marginally over the forecast period on the back of a modest economic recovery, reaching 59% by 2028.
According to the national statistics agency (INE), the unemployment rate fell from 15% in 2010 to 7% in 2018 (the INE has not produced unemployment statistics since then). However, even accounting for rigid labour laws, these data seem extremely disconnected from the country's economic realities. Our own projections put the unemployment rate much higher, at 34.3% in 2023. As macroeconomic conditions stabilise, we expect unemployment to fall more substantially, to 27.6% by 2028 (still extremely high by regional and global comparison). Moreover, a poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will hamper job quality and make more people dependent on the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for more than half of the country's workers.
Healthcare and education services will remain underfunded The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure and a lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. Equipment is mainly imported or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have been constrained by a lack of foreign currencies, particularly US dollars. Mismanagement and rampant corruption also limit the extent to which public spending can improve social outcomes. Other long-standing problems include a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals (particularly doctors and nurses). Based on these various factors, we expect the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services to remain poor for the foreseeable future.

Venezuela's deep economic depression in 2014-20 caused a sharp decline in living standards, with GDP per head falling by more than four-fifths, from a peak of US$12,921 in 2012 to an estimated US$1,784 in 2020. EIU estimates that GDP per head rose to US$3,673 in 2023, as a result of real currency appreciation and lower inflation. In purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, our estimate of GDP per head is higher, at US$5,845 in 2023, although this is still considerably lower than most large regional economies. We expect a moderate improvement in both GDP per head at market exchange rates and at PPP in the 2024-28 forecast period on the back of a slightly more stable macroeconomic environment. Even so, the economy remains highly vulnerable to currency depreciation and inflationary shocks, which are strongly related to one another because of the country's high dependence on imports, particularly of food and consumer goods. Political uncertainty will pose a major risk to the economic outlook in the lead-up to the 2024-25 election cycle (the presidential election is due to be held on July 28th 2024, followed by a legislative election in 2025).
Poverty rates will remain extremely high despite some recent improvement Apart from weak domestic purchasing power, several factors will constrain market opportunities in 2024-28, including persistently high rates of poverty and income inequality. According to the government, the poverty rate has fallen consistently, from 29.6% in 2004 to just 17.7% in 2021 (latest data available), with extreme poverty at just 4.1% in that year. However, these data contrast starkly with independent measures of multidimensional poverty. According to the Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida (Encovi, an annual survey conducted by three well-regarded local universities), the poverty rate rose from 39.3% in 2014 to 65.2% in 2021, which is consistent with the socioeconomic impact of the country's depression. An economic rebound in 2022 caused poverty to decline noticeably, to a still-high 50.5%, before edging up again in 2023, to 51.9%, as the economy fell back into recession. Based on Encovi figures, Venezuela's Gini index score-a measure of income inequality that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete inequality)-rose from 0.407 in 2014 to 0.512 in 2023. This makes Venezuela one of the most unequal societies on the planet.
An abysmal investment climate offsets many of the country's advantages Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition. Venezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location. However, this will not translate into real gains until a more market-friendly administration takes over (not our baseline forecast for 2024-28). The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions and a fairly favourable geographical location (given its proximity to the US). However, poor macroeconomic fundamentals have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and deteriorations in public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, a deterioration in the quality of healthcare and education provision in the past three decades has contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, as has an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

Retail sales volumes will be subdued in medium term As in the rest of Latin America, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure; this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped, owing to government controls and the country's severely damaged productive capacity. Moreover, limited availability of foreign exchange has resulted in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically. The weak outlook for economic recovery will subdue retail sales volumes throughout 2024-28.

EIU expects Venezuela's real GDP per head to grow by an annual average of just 2.8% in 2024-30, as the current regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), does not seem inclined to undertake the economic, legal and institutional reforms needed to engender more robust and sustainable growth. On a positive note, our long-term real GDP growth forecast of 3.4% in 2024-50 assumes that successor governments will gradually put forward structural reforms to the oil sector and the business environment. Nevertheless, the country's weak institutions, its dependence on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth. As a result, we forecast that real GDP per head will grow by a modest 2.2% per year in 2031-50, and that per-head GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) will be just US$18,090 by the end of that period. This will be lower than before the 2014-20 depression-extremely low for a country with Venezuela's endowment of national resources.
The 2014-20 depression will impair productivity in 2024-50 Initial conditions: Under the previous president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), the economy expanded strongly on the back of a global oil price bonanza and aggressive public spending (apart from a slump in 2009-10 caused by the global financial crisis). However, growth decelerated sharply in 2013, leading into a deep depression amid a collapse in oil prices, serious policy mismanagement and inefficiencies stemming from large-scale corruption. We estimate that real GDP contracted by a whopping 78% in 2014-20-the largest recorded collapse for any country not at war. A pivot towards more orthodox macroeconomic policies and the elimination of distortionary controls helped to stabilise the economy in 2021, which returned to growth in the first quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, the 2014-20 crisis will have long-lasting effects, many of which will prove extremely hard to reverse. Corruption and cronyism are deeply ingrained in the political culture, and rooting these out will be difficult. The emigration of most skilled labour and underinvestment in human capital will undermine the quality of the labour force for years to come. The infrastructure deficit will also widen, as fiscal constraints will impede public investment.
Demographic trends: As in most other developing countries, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, although the labour force itself will grow more quickly as participation rates rise. Even despite an exodus of young people since 2014, Venezuela will benefit from supportive population dynamics, as the dependency ratio of old to young will remain low by OECD standards. The share of the population aged 65 years and over will only be about 11% in 2050, whereas the share of the population of working age will remain high, at 67%. A particular risk to productivity is brain drain, as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad in recent years and are unlikely to return.
Oil will remain crucial to Venezuela's economic prospects External conditions: We estimate that oil accounts for close to 91.6% of export revenue. Although there will be a drive to diversify the productive base in the long term, it will be limited, and Venezuela will remain highly dependent on exports of oil and other commodities. We expect Venezuela to develop existing links with China, Russia and Iran; it will not develop links elsewhere until US sanctions are lifted, which we do not expect to happen until later this decade, at the earliest. In the longer term, however, we assume that governments will implement structural economic and political reforms, which will allow Venezuela to diversify away from oil to some degree and will breathe life back into its trade relationship with the US.
Institutions and policy trends: We assume that the Maduro government will take a more pragmatic approach to policy than it did before the 2014-20 depression. This implies that the government will continue its efforts to rein in fiscal imbalances and scale back distortionary controls. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty attached to our outlook, given that the government regards policy efficacy as subordinate to the need to maintain political control. Moreover, even assuming that the government does not reverse course on policy, prospects for improvements in other areas of the business environment are weak, as structural microeconomic reforms will not be forthcoming. Much-needed reforms to the social security system, labour legislation and trade policy will all be left to future administrations. In 2031-50 we assume that an eventual return to democracy will bring policy improvements, but gains will be slow to materialise, given the country's institutional weakness.
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy have been abandoned, Venezuela's GDP growth potential will be constrained by the erosion of the country's skills base and the large-scale capital destruction that has taken place over the past decade. However, there is still scope for recovery: we expect real GDP growth to average 3.5% in 2031-40, before picking up to 4% in 2041-50. Higher GDP growth rates are possible in the long term if new, more market-friendly administrations pursue reforms to the country's long-standing economic and political policies. Our forecasts assume that capital and labour will be the main contributors to growth, both recovering from a low base of comparison. However, productivity growth will disappoint, as adoption of new technologies remains challenging. The overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing boom-bust cycles, which will undermine macroeconomic stability and growth and will hamper prospects for catch-up with more developed economies.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, owing both to its geographical limitations and to the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the high concentration of the population along coastlines on unstable terrains (about 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean Sea). Given poor infrastructure maintenance and little disaster preparedness, population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in a rising number of extreme events per year in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded local university, concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration but would also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patterns (which are aggravated by oscillatory climate patterns such as El Niño) may disrupt hydroelectricity generation. This is a major problem, given that hydropower accounts for more than 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infra-structure projects, and minimal attention is given to disaster preparedness. Official data on carbon emissions and pollution in the country are scarce, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialist observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations.
Migration and urbanisation Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century, when the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of the population living in urban centres grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large Latin American countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real-estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spillover from the country's oil wealth, the exodus from rural areas to cities created sprawling shanty-towns across major metropolises, which public-housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, more than 7.7m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 in search of protection and a better life. Although to some degree this reflects a search for better economic opportunities abroad, some migrants have been driven from Venezuela by political factors and by crime (the country has one of the world's highest murder rates). Anecdotal evidence suggests that most outward migrants are young, well-trained professionals; the loss of these people will do significant damage to the country's long-term economic prospects. Under EIU's baseline assumption that there will not be a political transition in the short term, outward migration will continue (albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of Venezuela's crisis, in 2018-20).
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), scored some important victories in his first year in office. These include the passage of a reform that simplifies Brazil's cumbersome tax system and a new fiscal framework that establishes a ceiling for public spending. Nevertheless, Lula will face mounting challenges during the rest of his four-year term as his relationship with Brazil's right-leaning Congress deteriorates amid intense political polarisation and his popularity dips owing to a softer economy. Electoral considerations will make it increasingly difficult for Lula to push other items on his agenda (including a proposed income tax reform) through Congress as parties in his tenuous congressional coalition jockey for position in the run-up to the 2026 general election.

- Brazil's overall business environment score improves in EIU's 2024-28 forecast period, but greater advancements elsewhere mean that the country falls down the global ranking. Brazil remains in the middle of the regional ranking. The Lula administration's preference for statist development policies that require higher spending will weigh on the macroeconomic environment; government debt will rise, particularly as limited revenue-raising capacity will keep fiscal deficits wide. However, improvements in market opportunities, taxation, the labour market and infrastructure will more than compensate for the weaker macroeconomic environment score. Brazil performs well in foreign trade and exchange controls, policy towards foreign investment and financing, but political effectiveness will remain a weak spot.

- The legacy of high interest rates, coupled with a weak soybean harvest and unprecedented flooding in Brazil's south, will weigh on economic activity in 2024. We expect growth to accelerate later in the forecast period as a robust labour market, curbed inflation and lower interest rates lift investment and private consumption. However, given that the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) has kept rates high for longer than initially expected, the Brazilian monetary authorities are likely to slow their easing cycle, to the detriment of GDP growth. We forecast tepid average annual growth of 2% in 2024-28, based on the ramifications of Lula's statist economic policies for the business environment and limited structural reforms.

- Brazil's demographic dividend is nearly over, and deteriorating dynamics will weigh on long-term growth. An ageing population-the result of a declining birth rate and increasing life expectancy-means that workers will come under greater pressure to finance pensioners. The population will remain younger than in most high-income countries, but working-age population growth will fall below general population growth in 2024-28, limiting economic performance.

- Brazil returned to the list of the world's ten largest economies in 2023, reflecting a firm recovery from its pandemic-induced recession. However, GDP growth prospects are tepid owing to fiscal constraints, an ageing population and limited structural reforms. Moreover, it will be difficult to replicate the gains achieved in the decade before the 2014-16 recession in terms of reducing income inequality (reflected in job creation in low-skilled sectors, minimum-wage rises and a consumer credit boom). On a positive note, Brazil will offer attractive investment opportunities, especially in infrastructure, agriculture and energy, but also in critical minerals and potentially green hydrogen, which are important inputs for the global green energy transition.

- We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.8% in our long-term forecast period (2024-50). Slow labour force growth and subpar labour productivity will weigh on performance, despite progress in infrastructure and education, trade expansion, a stronger presence of multinational firms, and the development of Brazil's ample oil reserves. Growth could outperform our forecasts if improvements in policymaking and the business environment exceed expectations. Performance will fluctuate with commodity cycles, as agriculture and natural resource extraction remain major components of the economy. Climate change will curb agricultural growth despite technological advances to make crops more resistant to adverse temperatures.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and liberalised the economy. Brazil reaped the benefits of these reforms under the left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), and enjoyed a commodity-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended under Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), a weak economy and large corruption scandals contributed to public discontent that resulted in nationwide protests and ultimately led to her impeachment. The next administration, led by a far-right populist, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), was notable for stoking polarisation, attacking the judiciary and mismanaging the covid-19 pandemic. Amid heightened political polarisation, Lula returned to the presidency in 2023 for his third term, which is due to end in 2026 (although he could seek re-election).

Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by the Supreme Federal Court. The president can push legislation through using temporary decrees, but the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. More than 20 political parties are represented in Congress, and party discipline has traditionally been weak.

Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to rigidity in central government primary spending. Congress passed a robust pension reform in 2019, and in 2023 approved a new fiscal framework that limits public spending by up to 70% of revenue growth. However, Lula adjusted the targets in April 2024 to accommodate his plans to increase social spending and accelerate public works, weakening the credibility of the framework. Fiscal consolidation will be slow. The public debt/GDP ratio stood at 74.4% at end-2023 and the fiscal deficit at 7.5% of GDP. After embarking on an aggressive monetary-tightening cycle in early 2021 with the aim of taming inflation, the Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) started to lower interest rates in August 2023, taking the Selic rate from 13.75% to 10.5% as at mid-June.

Taxation: Brazil's poorly structured revenue system is characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy. In 2023 Congress passed a long-awaited reform to simplify the tax system by combining several taxes into a dual value-added tax. However, the new structure will be implemented 0ver a long transition period, which is due to end in 2033.

Foreign trade: According to the World Bank, the trade-weighted average tariff rate was 7.8% in 2021, well above the Latin American average (4.9%). Goods export earnings totalled US$339.7bn in 2023, and imports amounted to US$240.8bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) returned to the presidency in January 2023 for his third four-year term, having served two terms in 2003-10. Lula is suffering a dip in popularity amid a moderation in economic growth and a highly polarised society. His approval ratings currently stand at about 45-50%, compared with more than 70% at the end of his second term. Lula will seek to spur the economy and stabilise his position by stepping up public investment, as shown through the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC, a state-led growth acceleration plan).
Political parties will squabble with the executive over budget allocations for projects in their constituencies as the October 2024 municipal elections approach, sustaining governability challenges. Electoral considerations will continue to weigh on governability in the second half of Lula's term as parties in his fragile congressional coalition jockey for position in the run-up to the 2026 general election. Lula's PT holds less than 10% of the seats in the Senate (the upper house) and 13.3% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Although Lula's coalition-building efforts have given him a narrow majority in each house of Congress, the bloc is unwieldy and includes influential right-wing parties, which will make it harder for him to pass his statist and progressive agenda.

Political outlook: Political stability Now 18 months into his four-year term, Lula is suffering a dip in popularity due to disillusionment with his administration's record. He will seek to bolster his approval ratings by overseeing federal relief and reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of devastating floods that hit the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul in late April and early May. However, his efforts to own the recovery will stoke tensions with the governor of that state, Eduardo Leite of the centre-right Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira (PSDB), who has presidential aspirations and will spearhead the state's own efforts.
Lula will also hope that monetary easing and the PAC buoy the economy, stabilise his position and deliver a political boost for the PT and its allies ahead of the October 2024 municipal elections. He pushed landmark fiscal and sales tax reforms through Brazil's fragmented, right-leaning Congress in 2023, but local election considerations will make legislators reluctant to pass other reforms, and legislative activity will grind to a halt once campaigning begins in August. Political parties will also squabble with the executive over budget allocations for projects in their constituencies ahead of the local election campaigns, complicating governability.
EIU expects governability to erode in the second half of Lula's term as parties in his congressional alliance jockey for position ahead of the 2026 general election, making it harder for him to advance the rest of his statist and progressive agenda (including income tax reforms). To complicate matters, Brazilian society is heavily polarised, and this will remain the case in the 2024-28 forecast period, sustaining political stability risks.
Lula has a multi-party majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but it includes some influential right-wing parties and is unwieldy, meaning that it will not by any means provide a rubber stamp for his legislative agenda. Nor would it provide him with much support if his popularity were to collapse. Moreover, Lula's alliance with the leaders of the lower and upper houses, Arthur Lira and Rodrigo Pacheco respectively, is shaky. Both are pragmatic centre-right politicians and have co-operated with Lula on parts of his agenda (including tax simplification), but they will be less helpful on other aspects, such as the progressive elements of his income tax reform proposals, which may not come up for debate in Congress until after the local elections. Congress will elect new leaders for a two-year term in February 2025 (neither of the incumbents will stand), meaning that the balance of power between the legislature and the executive could shift. Congress has gained more budgetary control in recent years, but the president's powers of patronage remain formidable, which has allowed Lula to secure support for his agenda.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness In recent years Brazil's political environment has become sharply polarised between right and left, compounding many long-standing factors that have weakened governability and fuelled political instability. These include a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, extremely slow legal processes, high levels of crime and job informality, and a weak party system.
Rampant graft and bribery also explain Brazil's poor institutional and political effectiveness. In early 2024 the Supreme Federal Court (STF) overturned convictions against two prominent political figures who were implicated in Operação Lava Jato, a huge anti-corruption investigation that uncovered a multi-billion-dollar bribe scheme that diverted money from Petrobras (the state-controlled oil company). The reversal of the charges illustrates Brazil's relatively unstable legal framework and is likely to weaken confidence in the rule of law, posing risks to the country's democratic credentials.
A fragile governing coalition will keep Lula from veering too far to the left The centrão (a large group of centrist parties) holds the balance of power in Congress and plays a moderating role in public policy. Although Lula has formed a broad-based coalition (spanning far-left to centre-right parties), ideological differences mean that alliances between these groups are fragile, which will sustain governability challenges. The parties with representation in Lula's large cabinet of 38 ministers-much larger than the 23-member cabinet of his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22)-account for just over half of the legislators in each house of Congress. However, given that discipline in some of those parties is not strictly enforced, Lula's majority could fade if his government veers too far to the left or if his horse-trading efforts are insufficient to keep all of his allies satisfied.
Lula will also be constrained by the need to obtain support from the centrão to pass his agenda, which includes a progressive income tax reform and a complementary law that the government presented in April 2024 to govern the tax simplification reform. We think that the centrão would oppose any radical left-wing moves (such as the renationalisation of recently privatised companies), which decreases the risk of Congress approving reforms that are harmful to the business environment.
A factor that will support political effectiveness is that tensions between the executive and the judiciary have eased in recent years. Mr Bolsonaro insulted and attacked members of the high courts, criticising some of their decisions. Lula has repaired the relationship by respecting the autonomy of the judiciary. He has also appointed allies to replace STF members who reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 years, contributing to healthier executive-judiciary relations.
Election considerations will hinder progress on of reforms A particular weakness of Brazil's political system is that ambitious reforms are more likely in the first 12 months of an administration's four-year term. This partly reflects the fact that new governments generally enter with a strong mandate (which then erodes gradually) but is also a product of the electoral calendar; local elections fall due at the end of the president's second year in office, meaning that political parties are reluctant to approve unpopular measures in that year. The third year of a presidential term offers another window of opportunity for reforms before attention turns to the next general election in the final year. Further weaknesses of the system are the large number of stakeholders at various levels of government (federal, state and local) and socioeconomic differences between Brazil's regions, which influence the motivations of their representatives.
Moreover, politicians of all stripes are open to lobbying from private interest groups, as well as public-sector unions. The highest-paid civil servants are particularly well organised, which has enabled them to secure ever-greater budgetary resources via higher salaries and benefits. Administrative reforms that could help to modernise the civil service (for example by phasing out redundant roles) and to make it more efficient are unlikely under Lula, owing to his proximity to labour unions.
Political outlook: Election watch Brazilians will next vote in October, in nationwide municipal elections, which will help us to gauge sentiment towards Lula's left-wing government and support for right-wing parties ahead of the 2026 presidential, state and congressional elections. The dynamics of the presidential contest will depend on economic factors; a disappointing performance would weigh on Lula's chances of running for re-election (which he appears keen to do) or choosing a successor (the finance minister, Fernando Haddad, would be his first choice) and would improve the prospects for a right-of-centre contender.
Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro is on tricky ground. The Superior Electoral Court has already stripped him of his political rights for eight years for abusing his presidential powers, rendering him ineligible to run in 2026. Imprisonment is a possibility, as more evidence of an alleged attempted coup at the 2022 general election has emerged. Mr Bolsonaro denies wrongdoing. Although the investigations will damage his reputation, the former president commands a loyal base, and we think that he will retain enough power to influence the choice of the next right-wing presidential candidate-possibly Tarcísio de Freitas or Romeu Zema, the respective governors of São Paulo and Minas Gerais-while remaining prominent in his own right. Mr Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, is popular but lacks political experience and so is unlikely to be chosen. Given that Mr Bolsonaro's allies increased their presence in both houses of Congress in 2022, and that Lula beat him to the presidency by a slim margin, the right wing could feasibly retake power in 2026.
Political outlook: International relations Lula will try to take Brazil along its traditional "non-aligned" path by forging ties with other nations in the newly expanded BRICS club of emerging economies -particularly China-to forge a multipolar world in which Brazil is a global player. Lula will harness Brazil's 12-month tenure of the G20 presidency (ending in December 2024) to this end. Moreover, Brazil will host the COP30 climate summit in 2025, giving Lula an opportunity to showcase his environmental record, which will depend partly on reducing Amazon deforestation.
The stakes for Brazil are rising amid geopolitical fragmentation. Lula has adopted a neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, irking Western powers who regard Lula's Brazil as a less reliable partner for co-operation on geopolitically sensitive issues than they had initially thought. Lula is seeking ratification of a free-trade agreement between the EU and Mercosul (a regional customs union), but disagreements over the EU's environmental conditions, Lula's desire for protectionist public procurement rules and opposition from European farmers (especially in France) make a deal unlikely.
Closer to home, we expect ties between Brazil and several South American countries with left-wing or authoritarian leaders to strengthen, although tensions between neighbouring Guyana and Venezuela will test Brazilian diplomacy. Given their ideological similarities, Lula is supportive of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, despite his erosion of Venezuela's democratic norms. Brazil will maintain working relations with Argentina under its libertarian president, Javier Milei, but ideological differences between them will stymie Lula's efforts to represent South America on the world stage.

Overview: Brazil's overall business environment score improves in the 2024-28 forecast period, keeping the country in the middle of EIU's regional ranking. However, Brazil falls in our global ranking as countries such as South Africa and Vietnam make greater advancements. Greater market opportunities and taxes strengthen Brazil's score, but rising government debt is weakening the macroeconomic environment. Even though a new fiscal framework is in place, the state-led development strategy of the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), will discourage fiscal discipline.
Strengths: Brazil performs well in foreign trade and exchange controls, policy towards foreign investment and financing. The country will continue to attract investment owing to its large market, its diversified economy, its deep domestic capital markets and its role in the global green energy transition.
Weaknesses: Political effectiveness remains a weak spot, owing to an inefficient legal system, corruption and crime. Brazil's performance in the taxes and infrastructure categories is also lacklustre but should improve. Fiscal constraints and mismanagement will hinder infrastructure development.
What to watch
- The government presented the main complementary bill to regulate its tax simplification reform (passed in late 2023) in April. The core text upholds the reform's simplifying spirit, but Congress and businesses are likely to skew the bill in their interests. Changes to the tax code are likely to come in over 2027-33.
- We assume that Lula will win a fourth term at the October 2026 general election, but there is a risk that a right-wing government will return to power. The Superior Electoral Court has made the former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), ineligible for misuse of political influence, but he could transfer his support to another candidate, sustaining risks of a change in government.

Business environment outlook: Brazil's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Current right-leaning Congress checks statist tendencies of president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but leaders of both houses could become more Lula-friendly following congressional leadership elections in February 2025.
2026-28: Fiscal constraints encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment partnerships programme becomes more established and reliable, with improved legal framework and stronger regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Lula's controversial positions on key geopolitical issues send mixed signals to Western governments, spooking some investors.
2026-28: Brazil remains among top destinations of foreign direct investment (FDI) globally. Opportunities are plentiful, particularly in areas related to global energy transition, such as critical minerals and green hydrogen.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Crude oil production and exports expand, propping up trade growth, attracting FDI and building foreign reserves, all of which support local currency.
2026-28: Ratification of EU-Mercosul free-trade agreement is unlikely, but Brazil's improved environmental, social and governance agenda help in trade negotiations with EU, and potentially with other countries and regional blocs.
Taxes 2024-25: Lula advances with tax simplification reform. Government tries to reform income taxes and to introduce taxes on wealthy Brazilians and on dividends, but right-leaning Congress hinders efforts.
2026-28: Tax simplification starts to come into effect, but full impact will only be felt beyond EIU's 2024-28 forecast horizon.
Financing 2024-25: Subsidised credit increases, but with higher participation from private banks, as government offers collaterals.
2026-28: Role of private capital markets in Brazil's financing structure expands. Fiscal constraints and high indebtedness limit the extent to which direct public lending drives growth.
The labour market 2024-25: Lula retains elements of 2017 labour reform but seeks targeted changes, such as stronger protection for informal, autonomous workers and for gender equality.
2026-28: Higher educational and specialised training levels among Brazil's youth lift labour productivity over long term.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Infrastructure concessions advance, but political and institutional constraints sustain risk of delays.
2026-28: Infrastructure gap stays wide, as sector investments are insufficient to maintain and expand projects.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Congress stalls bills on digital oversight and regulation owing to concerns about their impact on innovation.
2026-28: E-government services and digital inclusion advance, especially as central bank's digital currency gains traction.

Overview: Brazil's macroeconomic environment benefits from price stability, a favourable external balance and solid institutions, but a weak fiscal account weighs it down. Consecutive and wide fiscal deficits, inefficient spending and strained revenue growth will lift Brazil's already-high public debt in our 2024-28 forecast period, weakening the macroeconomic environment score. Brazil falls by seven places in our global ranking (surpassed by the likes of Greece, Colombia and Angola) and drops by one spot in our regional ranking (outperformed by Dominican Republic). Although a promising fiscal framework became law in 2023, adjustments made in April 2024 will sustain concerns about the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation.
Strengths: Brazil's large market, which we expect to reach US$2.7trn by 2028, will continue to attract investors. The country's structural trade surplus, driven by agricultural exports, will benefit further from strong oil production over the medium and long term, strengthening the external balance. A monetary-easing cycle in the US, which we expect to start in September 2024, will support the exchange rate and bolster asset prices.
Weaknesses: A heavy public-debt burden and fiscal imbalances will sustain macroeconomic risks throughout our forecast period. The Lula administration's expansionary fiscal and credit policies will further feed fiscal concerns, exerting upward pressure on Brazil's risk-premiums.
What to watch
- In the 2025 budget proposal, presented in April 2024, the government relaxed its primary fiscal targets and is now aiming to reach a primary surplus of 1% of GDP by 2028 (from 2026 previously). We think that even the revised target is unattainable, as mandatory spending items-such as pensions, some social assistance programmes and healthcare expenses-will become increasingly costly and because there is little political will from the Lula administration to cut spending in other areas. Missed fiscal targets will prompt additional adjustments to the fiscal framework, hurting its credibility over time.
- The term of the current governor of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank), Roberto Campos Neto, expires at end-2024, which means that Lula will nominate a new governor to serve in 2025-28. As Lula criticised Mr Campos Neto for being too cautious with the current monetary-easing cycle (it started later and proceeded more slowly than Lula wanted), the next BCB governor will probably have a more dovish orientation ahead of the 2026 election, meaning that inflation control is likely to be looser. There is a risk that the inflation target (currently at 3%) will rise, leaving inflation expectations unanchored, but this is not our current baseline forecast. We do not expect Lula to undermine the BCB's independence or to interfere with the existing floating exchange-rate regime.

Overview: Brazil boasts strong private-property protections, free competition and few price controls, keeping the country second-best in the region for this category, behind Chile. However, Brazil sinks towards the middle of our global ranking, as improving countries such as Romania and Argentina leapfrog stagnant Brazil. Lula and the PT's preference for state-led development policies reduces prospects for privatisation and raises the likelihood that regulatory agencies will gain more power and that intervention in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will increase. However, Lula will continue to seek public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure projects and to expand Brazil's footprint in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space, which will create opportunities for investors.
Strengths: The right-leaning Congress will prevent Lula from expanding the role of the state in the market excessively; for example, it will block any attempts to roll back privatisations that took place under past administrations, as Lula suggested that he would seek to do during his election campaign and early in his term. Brazil's abundant water resources, renewables-based energy matrix and technologically advanced agri-business sector will give the country an advantage in the global energy transition.
Weaknesses: Policy towards private enterprise and competition depends on the political landscape. The terms of the presidents of both houses of Congress expire this year, and there is a risk that their replacements will be more aligned with Lula. This would weaken the legislature's capacity to act as a check on the administration's statist and interventionist policies.
What to watch
- The Supreme Federal Court (STF) is in deliberations over an attempt by the Lula administration to regain state control over Eletrobras, an electric power company that was privatised in 2022. The renationalisation of Eletrobras (not our baseline scenario) would shake investor confidence in the legal system and the enforceability of contracts.
- Petrobras, a state-controlled oil and gas firm, is often subject to political interference, and Lula will nudge its corporate decisions to cater to his social and political agenda. For example, Petrobras's pricing policy is a constant source of friction between private shareholders and the state. Whereas private investors prefer prices to be aligned with international prices in order to maximise profits, the government is concerned about inflationary pressures. In May 2024 Lula ousted the company's head, Jean Paul Prates, and replaced him with Magda Chambriard, a well-regarded engineer. We expect her to be pragmatic and ensure broad continuity, but there is a risk that she will be more tolerant of state intervention than Mr Prates.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Brazil's score for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged in 2024-28, but the country slips down the global and regional rankings as countries including the UAE, Thailand and Argentina improve. Investor protection is the weakest indicator in the category, owing to the heavy hand of the state in the economy. Still, openness to foreign investors, low expropriation risk and limited government favouritism mean that Brazil will remain a major destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) in our forecast period.
Strengths: Brazil's large market size and diversified economy, combined with major changes (such as the tax simplification reform), will attract investor interest in areas such as infrastructure, agribusiness and green energy. The global energy transition offers opportunities for Brazil, particularly as the country has reserves of the critical minerals necessary for green technologies and could become a major producer of green hydrogen. Brazil also stands to benefit from its reputation for being a safe haven from geopolitical risks.
Weaknesses: Lula's non-aligned foreign policy has become a sticking point with Western powers, as it signals that his Brazil will be a less reliable partner than previously expected. Brazil's neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict has weighed on the country's relations with the West, spooking some investors.
What to watch
- Lula's efforts to put Brazil on the global stage are increasing the country's visibility, especially on issues involving ESG policies. Brazil has some of the world's largest deposits of the critical minerals that are essential for the global energy transition. It also has the potential to become a major producer of green hydrogen, owing to its vast water resources and its largely renewables-based energy matrix. However, significant investment is needed to unlock Brazil's growth potential in these sectors.
- Opportunities for foreign capital in sectors such as infrastructure, logistics and energy will grow as tax rules and bureaucracy are streamlined. At end-2023 the government exempted all foreign investors who hold shares in participation investment funds (FIPs, local private-equity funds) from income taxes; previously the tax break was only available to foreign investors who held up to 40% of the shares of a given FIP. Moreover, in April 2024 the government launched the Eco Invest Brazil programme, which seeks to promote and attract foreign investment into climate-change related projects, for example by offering protections against exchange risks and volatility.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Brazil's highest score is for foreign trade and exchange controls. This reflects a strong current-account position, capital-account liberalisation, and ease and openness to trade, although there is room for improvement in terms of lifting tariff and non-tariff protections. Brazil's score remains unchanged from the 2019-23 historical period, but the country drops by five spots in the global ranking (surpassed by the likes of Vietnam, Jordan and South Africa) and by one position in the regional ranking (losing out to El Salvador).
Strengths: Although we expect imports to increase as domestic demand strengthens, exports will also grow, especially as crude oil production expands. Sizeable inward FDI inflows will also help to contain the current-account deficit. Brazil's floating exchange-rate regime, which is lightly managed by the independent central bank, and robust foreign reserves support the currency, which shields the country against a balance-of-payments crisis.
Weaknesses: Lula's preference for promoting trade and investment relations within the global south will weigh on partnership opportunities with advanced economies. For example, OECD accession has been put on the back burner in order to focus on the BRICS group of emerging markets. The group initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but Brazil pushed for its expansion, approving membership invitations to countries including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the UAE in 2023. Lula will seek to strengthen the enlarged BRICS as well as Mercosul (a customs union that also includes Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay), which remains a protectionist bloc.
What to watch
- Ratification of a proposed EU-Mercosul free-trade agreement (FTA) remains at an impasse, even though negotiators finalised the deal's terms in 2019. The European side is demanding more stringent environmental conditions and better protections for its farmers, and Brazil is requesting protectionist public procurement rules. There is a chance that the prospect of a Mercosul-China FTA-a deal that Uruguay is particularly keen to sign-will pressure European parliaments to be more flexible with their terms, expediting ratification of the deal. However, our view is that ratification is unlikely in 2024-28, especially as gains made by right-wing parties at the recent European Parliament elections in June 2024 will strengthen the union's protectionist bloc.
- A reform to make Mercosul more flexible is possible. Although Brazil has the most influence over the bloc, the left-right ideological balance within Mercosul has skewed against Lula, as Argentina joined the liberal wing (previously comprising only Paraguay and Uruguay) following the election of its far-right president, Javier Milei, in late 2023. Lula could allow some piecemeal reforms to prevent the bloc from fragmenting.
- Lula is attempting to guide Brazil's export-oriented commodity sector to an ESG-friendly course. If he is successful, strong ESG credentials are likely to improve Brazil's position in brokering favourable deals and would boost trade.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Brazil's complex tax regime is a heavy burden on its business environment; its score in this category is one of its weakest. The tax simplification reform approved in late 2023 has helped to improve Brazil's score in 2024-28, lifting its global ranking by nine spots (surpassing countries including Italy, Nigeria and Algeria) and its regional ranking by three positions (overtaking Colombia and Dominican Republic and drawing level with Mexico). However, implementing legislation has yet to be finalised and passed, and if Congress or business lobbies skew the reform in their favour, there is a high risk that the benefits (which will become more apparent beyond our forecast period) will be less pronounced than we expect.
Strengths: The tax simplification reform seeks to combine five different taxes into two value-added tax (VAT) levies. Although the intention is that the reform will be revenue-neutral, the government believes that it will actually boost tax revenue by lifting economic growth, as the elimination of red tape will incentivise entrepreneurship and investments. We assume that some of these benefits will materialise, but likely tweaks by Congress and business interest groups suggest that the gains will be muted.
Weaknesses: Brazil currently has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world. With a tax burden of about 33% of GDP in 2023, Brazil is on a par with the advanced economies of the OECD despite its emerging-market status. A wide array of sectoral benefits and tax exemptions, coupled with indirect taxation levied on goods and services (about 45% in Brazil compared with the OECD average of 32% of total taxes), ultimately pushes up the cost of business operations and weighs on Brazil's competitiveness.
What to watch
- In April 2024 the Lula administration presented a proposal to regulate the new dual-VAT regime, including the base VAT rate (estimated currently at 26.5%, compared with 27.5% previously), the items that will receive preferential and exempted status, and revenue distribution across government levels (federal, state and municipal). The government hopes to hold a vote by July, but we do not expect it to materialise before end-2024, or possibly early 2025. Negotiations with Congress, state and municipal governments, and business sectors will be arduous; municipal elections in October will also disrupt the legislative calendar. Lula will need to stand his ground to prevent multiple interest groups from distorting the reform, which raises the risks that VAT could rise even higher (at 26.5%, it is already among the world's highest) and that the bill's simplifying objective could be undermined.
- The government intends to redesign the income tax regime to make it more progressive, pro-investment and reliant on individuals rather than on corporations. We believe that the reform is unlikely to pass owing to resistance from legislators, especially if it ultimately increases the tax burden on the middle class or lifts the overall tax burden.
- The Lula administration will continue its efforts to close tax loopholes to recover revenue as part of its strategy to improve the fiscal position. However, efforts will encounter increasing resistance from interest groups as the 2026 general election approaches.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Brazil performs well in the financing category owing to the strength of its banking sector, few financial distortions, solid financial regulations and good capital-market access for foreigners. However, there is room for improvement in terms of stockmarket capitalisation and access to investment finance. The country's financing score remains unchanged in 2024-28, but its global rank drops by 12 spots as other countries including Qatar, Hungary and South Korea improve. Brazil remains a top performer in our regional ranking, second only to Chile.
Strengths: After growing steadily since 2016, the boost that private capital markets received in 2020-21 from record-low pandemic-era interest rates solidified their standing, enabling growth even as monetary policy tightened in 2021-22. The BCB embarked on a monetary-easing cycle in August 2023, taking the Selic policy rate from a peak of 13.75% to 10.5% as at mid-June. We expect the BCB to trim the policy rate to 10% by end-2024. Financial conditions will ease as interest rates come down, reducing the overall cost of capital and credit and encouraging private-sector investment.
Weaknesses: Fiscal constraints and high levels of household indebtedness will dampen the extent to which direct public lending can sustain growth. Although public lending generally contributes to credit and economic growth in a competitive environment, subsidised interest rates as offered by state banks distort the credit market and generate inefficiencies.
What to watch
- In February 2024 the monetary authorities changed the regulations for several tax-exempt private debt securities in the agricultural and real-estate sectors, such that corporate issuers must be directly involved in one of those sectors. The change closes a loophole that enabled companies outside those sectors to issue these incentivised securities. We believe that investors will rebalance their portfolios within capital markets, and that movements to other asset classes are unlikely. Offerings of those popular instruments will diminish, straining liquidity, but other tax-exempt securities, especially those with inflation protections, will remain attractive amid falling nominal interest rates.
- In April 2024 the government launched the Acredita programme, which provides microcredit lines to low-income households and small businesses at below-market rates and with facilitated debt-renegotiation mechanisms. The programme aims to draw participation from public and private banks alike, as the federal government will guarantee the subsidised loans. The programme also expands the role of the Empresa Gestora de Ativo (a state company that manages the federal government's real-estate assets) to act as an asset manager to securitise real-estate portfolios owned by private banks. This goal of this change is to boost housing credit by freeing up private banks' balance sheets for new real-estate financing. As government entities will absorb much of the risk, we believe that private banks will be encouraged to participate, which will mitigate risks of market distortions and inefficiencies.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Owing to improvements in language skills, workforce health and the cost of living, Brazil's labour market will strengthen in our forecast period. Structural improvements have helped the labour force participation rate to increase and unemployment to reach its lowest point in almost a decade. However, many countries will also improve as the pandemic aftermath recedes into the past. As a result, Brazil's global ranking falls by nine places (surpassing the likes of Spain, Russia, China and South Korea), but it remains sixth out of the 12 geographies in Latin America.
Strengths: The unemployment rate had fallen to 7.4% as at end-2023-the lowest since 2015. Prospects for growth in manufacturing and infrastructure will lift demand for skilled labour and better-paid jobs, which will make the labour market more dynamic and vibrant over 2024-28. Although participation among the young population (16-25 years old) is low, this is mostly because a greater proportion of that group now spends more time in higher education and training. This will translate into better language and technical skills in the long term, potentially raising upside risks beyond our 2024-28 forecast horizon.
Weaknesses: Although wages are fairly low, the overall cost of labour for employers is high, as social security obligations and labour benefits add up to one-third of a worker's salary onto the actual cost of employment. Moreover, labour regulations are often subject to political whims, which can be volatile, generating uncertainty around the stability of labour rules and contracts.
What to watch
- Although the Lula government has criticised liberalising labour reforms that were introduced in 2017 under a former president, Michel Temer (2016-18), the current right-leaning Congress would block any attempts to roll these back in any significant way. Nevertheless, the government is likely to pass some piecemeal measures to strengthen contractual arrangements for workers in expanding informal sectors (such as drivers for ride-sharing mobile applications) to give them similar benefits to formal sector workers.
- Owing to high labour costs, Congress has once more extended a payroll tax relief programme for 17 labour-intensive sectors to 2027. First introduced in 2011, the tax relief has been extended repeatedly, but the Lula government is adamant that it wants to abolish the programme, claiming that it has drained pension revenue without creating more and better jobs. In parallel, the government will resume proposals to permanently reduce the cost of labour in all sectors, while reducing the burden of payroll tax and increasing taxation on corporate income and profits to lift revenue and narrow the fiscal gap. We assume that some of these measures will materialise, enhancing the country's competitiveness and benefiting labour-intensive sectors such as services, construction and retail.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Brazil's difficulty in reversing long-standing deficiencies in infrastructure provision-partly due to fiscal constraints, mismanagement and corruption-keeps its score in this category weak, despite marginal improvements in road density. Brazil falls into the lowest quintile, overtaken by countries including Kenya, India and Vietnam. However, Brazil's regional ranking improves by one position, displacing Peru.
Strengths: Brazil performs well for broadband connection speed, and its distribution, ports and airports infrastructure are fair. Operators are expanding the 5G network quickly. The Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel, the telecoms agency) expects 5G coverage to reach 85% of the population by mid-2024 (from just 24% in 2022), as mobile operators will be able to access more spectrum in the 3.5-GHz band. Access to electricity is high, but reliability of the electricity supply is poor, owing to its reliance on hydropower plants amid vulnerability to climate change risks. The Lula administration considers infrastructure development an important vehicle for creating jobs, meaning that investments will continue as the government pursues PPP projects via its PPI.
Weaknesses: At about 2% of GDP, public and private spending in infrastructure is low-below the estimated 4% of GDP needed just to prevent existing infrastructure from decaying, according to Inter.B, a local consultancy that specialises in the sector. Although most Brazilians have a mobile phone, network coverage is below the global average, largely because the country's territory is vast and includes impenetrable areas in the Amazon region. The country relies heavily on road transport, which is insufficient and poor, as extensive lengths of roads are unpaved. Sanitation infrastructure is also lacking; only about 84% of the urban population is serviced with potable water and 55% with sewage networks.
What to watch
- Private concessions of infrastructure assets through the PPI will advance, driving upgrade efforts in 2024-28. Since its launch in 2016, 241 projects have been completed under the PPI. As at May 2024 there were 208 projects in the pipeline, led by transport (85), urban infrastructure (43) and environmental projects (23).
- Although the previous administration's plan to privatise the Port of Santos (Latin America's largest port) has been scrapped, the Lula government has continued to increase private participation in the port by using the PPP model for specific port components that need upgrades. Political disagreements have not impeded the advancement of PPP projects related to the Port of Santos so far, but the risk of project delays will rise as the 2026 general election approaches.
- Sanitation projects remain delayed but will pick up as it becomes clear to investors that the liberalising 2022 basic sanitation reform will stay in place. In 2023 Lula attempted to walk back some market-friendly aspects of the basic sanitation reform by giving a leg-up to SOEs, for example by making it easier for state companies to retain contracts, relaxing economic and financial capacity criteria for companies to sign new contracts, and allowing state companies to take on contracts without bidding in some metropolitan regions. Congress overturned the decrees, signalling that the sector will not be renationalised.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: There were notable regulatory improvements in 2019-23, such as the launch of the national Internet of Things plan in 2019 and a 5G network auction in 2021. Progress will slow in 2024-28, but Brazil will still improve by one position globally (surpassing Russia) and will remain in the middle by regional standards. Brazil performs well in terms of patent applications, scope of e-government, internet use and spending on research and development (R&D), despite the country's weak mobile penetration.
Strengths: Brazil has been at the forefront of providing digital government services (e-government) and is still making progress. Pix, a digital payment system, gained popularity quickly after its introduction in November 2020, and 99% of Brazilian adults have now registered. The BCB is working on its own digital currency (expected to launch by end-2024), aims to complement Pix and wants to promote financial and digital inclusion.
Weaknesses: Digital inclusion is still a challenge. About 81% of the population has internet access, but coverage among the rural population is lower, at 73%, and is at just 61% among low-income households. High-speed broadband penetration is weak, with just 22.5 accesses per 100,000 population as at January 2024. Mobile subscriptions are also low; China, Ghana and Paraguay all have higher densities than Brazil. Low penetration contributes to Brazil's middling quality of e-commerce business environment, cyber-security preparedness and research infrastructure, which weakens the country's technological readiness score.
What to watch
- The BCB aims to introduce its own central bank digital currency, the Drex, by end-2024. The Drex will complement the circulation of traditional money and promises to reduce operational costs, increase financial and digital inclusion and make wholesale and retail transactions more secure. Although the Drex pilot programme is in its final stages, we expect the launch to be delayed until early 2025, given that regulatory agencies still need to outline the new legal framework for the digital currency and its infrastructure.
- Congress is currently discussing a bill to tighten regulation on social media with the aim of curbing the spread of fake news and hate speech on digital platforms. The upper house approved the bill in 2020, but it has stalled in the lower house. The president of the lower house, Arthur Lira, has suggested that the bill be discussed by a specialised congressional committee, which indicates that it will not advance in the near term.
- Inspired by the European Digital Markets Act, a digital markets regulation bill seeks to set rules for the organisation and operation of digital platforms by creating an antitrust framework with oversight from Anatel. The rules aim to combat unfair practices and limit the market concentration of large technology companies. However, the bill has been stuck in the lower house since 2022, owing to concerns that it could stifle innovation. We think that it is unlikely to move forward in the current term, but the Congress that takes office in 2026 could advance the bill in the second half of our forecast period.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Although economic policy will be somewhat expansionary, progress on tax and fiscal reforms is generally propping up investor confidence in Brazil's outlook. The president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is also seeking to encourage state-led development through a new industrial policy that was unveiled in January and through the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC, a state-led growth acceleration plan), which aims to increase public and private investments, financed partly by the Brazilian Development Bank. Meanwhile, the government will install allies in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to support its public policy goals, but this could weaken their governance structures. For example, in May Lula replaced the head of Petrobras (the state-controlled oil company) with a figure who is more likely to support his own downstream investment priorities for the firm. Although new privatisations are unlikely, progress on infrastructure concessions will continue through the PAC. Another of Lula's ambitions is to strengthen environmental policies in order to facilitate more foreign investment or at least reduce the risk of divestment.
The government's next policy priority-and the item that will dominate the legislative agenda in the next 12 months-is the passage of complementary laws to regulate a tax simplification reform that was approved in December 2023. The first of three expected bills reached Congress in April, but we expect it to take until 2025 to pass the entire package, which will regulate the unification of several federal, state and local-sales taxes into a dual value-added tax (VAT)-style rate over the 2026-34 transition process. The government estimates that VAT will be levied at 26.5% (less than the original 27.5%), which would make it one of the world's highest. As Congress and business lobbies will have a chance to weigh in and expand the list of exempt and preferential products, the final VAT rate is likely to be even higher than anticipated.
Another near-term government priority will be to introduce a progressive reform to raise the lower income tax threshold and to impose taxes on dividends and on the wealthy. However, obtaining congressional approval for some of these changes will be tricky, and EIU thinks that a vote is unlikely to occur until 2025, if at all.
Brazil will play a growing role in the global energy transition. Initiatives to build green hydrogen plants in the Northeast region are under way. The country also boasts considerable renewable energy resources, including for hydro, solar and wind power production. At the same time, however, Brazil is on course to increase its oil output to more than 5m barrels/day by 2028, from 3.5m b/d currently, as more oil from "pre-salt" discoveries in the mid-2000s comes on stream. The next frontier for exploration will be in the Equatorial Margin area, with the aim of replenishing reserves once output from pre-salt fields begins to decline from 2030. Given that this will affect offshore waters near the Amazon estuary, there will be environmental concerns, although we expect Brazil's regulatory agency to approve exploration initiatives, facilitating new concessions.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Public-sector expenditure 37.9 37.9 37.1 37.1 36.9 36.7
Public-sector revenue 36.4 36.0 35.8 35.6 35.7 35.8
Public-sector budget balance -7.5 -7.7 -6.9 -6.6 -6.2 -6.2
Total public-sector debt 74.4 78.3 82.7 86.2 88.0 90.2
Complementing revised public spending rules (a reform in 2023 removed a cap on real federal expenditure, allowing it to rise by up to 70% of real revenue growth), Brazil's fiscal framework includes targets to swing from a primary deficit last year to balance in 2024-25 and towards a surplus of 1% of GDP by 2028. These targets carry a tolerance range of 0.25% of GDP, which should improve budget management by helping to avoid disorderly year-end adjustments. Even though the government has relaxed these targets relative to those that it announced last year, we believe that it will still fall short, given its overly optimistic revenue projections and our belief that Lula's new industrial policy and the PAC will raise spending more than it expects.
We think that balancing the primary accounts (including the intended increase in spending) is unrealistic in 2024. Even though the emergency spending on reconstruction and relief efforts for Rio Grande do Sul-probably worth at least 0.3-0.4% of GDP-will be excluded from the official fiscal rules framework, the government will still need to generate extra revenue to hit its targets. To that end, the administration has been attempting to clear a huge backlog of tax disputes with firms and to change tax legislation. Even though Lula has brought some influential right-of-centre parties into the government, we believe that some of these revenue-raising bills will fail to pass. We expect the government to raise less than half of the extra revenue (equivalent to 1.5% of GDP) that it envisages in 2024, which contributes to our view that it will miss its primary balance targets this year and in subsequent ones, and that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise to nearly 90% by 2028. Given Brazil's heavy debt burden, fiscal policy will remain the principal source of macroeconomic risk, although low public external indebtedness means that a debt crisis would evolve as an inflationary problem rather than as an external debt default.

Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

Lending rate (av) 43.6 37.0 32.0 32.0 32.0 32.0
Selic overnight rate (av) 11.2 8.8 7.8 7.1 7.0 6.9
The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) dialled down its pace of monetary easing in May, reducing the Selic rate by just 25 basis points-a departure from cuts of 50 basis points at successive meetings since the easing cycle began in August 2023, when the Selic rate stood at 13.75%. We expect the BCB to make only two more 25-basis-point cuts this year, before pausing at 10%. Based on our (benign) assumption that inflation will dip to 3.5% over the medium term, we have pencilled in cuts totalling another 50-150 basis points later in the forecast period, implying real rates of 4.5-5.5% in 2025-28, which we consider neutral. At its mid-2024 meeting we expect the monetary council to confirm a 3% inflation target for 2025-26 and set a target of 3% for 2027, which will calm fears of upward adjustments and help to re-anchor inflation expectations. One risk from the probable appointment of Gabriel Galípolo, a Lula ally, as BCB governor from January 2025 is that monetary policy could turn more accommodative ahead of the 2026 election cycle, meaning that inflation control would be looser. Moreover, by January 2025 seven of the nine board members will be Lula appointees, meaning that the monetary policy council will be weighted firmly in his favour.

Economic growth will slow to 2% in 2024, owing partly to the lagged effects of the BCB's aggressive monetary-tightening cycle in 2021-23. Another contributory factor is that a smaller 2023/24 harvest will constrain the contribution from the agriculture sector, after a bumper grain crop in 2022/23 lifted overall growth last year. Disastrous flooding in late April and early May will result in lost agricultural and industrial output; huge government spending on reconstruction and relief will only partly offset the impact. The latest economic data signal that monetary policy easing has started to spur stronger household consumption and investment, helping to engender a cyclical upturn that will endure over the medium term. We expect growth to average 2% per year in 2025-28, supported by a reasonably firm labour market, which may well be benefiting from labour reforms in 2017.
Higher social spending, minimum-wage rises and a boost to credit from a household debt restructuring programme for up to 30m people will put a floor under private consumption and support GDP growth. However, fiscal and debt dynamics will not be favourable enough to bring down local financing costs substantially; this will weigh on investment, although higher state-bank lending will compensate to some extent. The tax simplification reform augurs well for long-term growth, as it will simplify and clarify Brazil's hugely cumbersome tax regime, reducing compliance costs and promoting greater operational efficiency. However, most of the benefits will accrue beyond our 2024-28 forecast period.
On the supply side, agriculture and mining exports will rise in 2024-28 as global demand firms up. Manufacturing and services growth will strengthen as interest rates ease. Services will expand more modestly, following consumption trends.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The agriculture sector is more important than its small share of GDP (8.5% in 2023) suggests, owing to its significance as an employer in rural areas and the importance of agri-business industries for the domestic market and exports. The agriculture industry also produces positive spillovers, for example by spurring transport activity, which is an important source of growth in the services sector.
La Niña poses risks to agricultural production for the 2024/25 harvest After a record grains harvest in 2022/23, we estimate that crop yields tumbled by 7.6% in 2023/24 (output fell from 319.8m tonnes to 295.5m tonnes), largely owing to adverse climate conditions triggered by El Niño. Looking ahead, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration gives a 70% probability that a La Niña weather phenomenon will emerge in the second half of 2024, with effects possibly lasting until early 2025. We do not think that La Niña would bring too much disruption to the agriculture sector, although there is a significant risk that climate change will make its effects stronger (and possibly longer-lasting) than expected, fuelling heavy rains in the North and Northeast regions and drought in the South. Depending on the intensity, these conditions could dampen yields of important crops in the 2024/25 harvest season, weighing on GDP growth. Although climate uncertainty adds a fair amount of downside risk, the sector will still benefit from technological improvements and more intensive land use, as well as from good fundamentals for soft-commodity exports, owing to rising demand in the developing world.
The Lula administration understands the importance of agriculture to the Brazilian economy and will support its growth. However, the government has also made the environment a priority; coupled with mounting international pressure to contain deforestation, this will create nodes of divergence with the agricultural sector. According to a 2023 study by MapBiomas, a local environmental non-governmental organisation, more than 90% of legal and illegal deforestation in Brazil is directly or indirectly caused by agriculture. To address this, Lula is reversing the anti-environmental policies of his far-right predecessor and has promised to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030. Lula's green agenda will probably make it harder for Brazilian farmers to receive authorisation for legal deforestation, which will hinder the expansion of crop and pasture areas and weigh on agriculture growth.
Competitiveness weaknesses will weigh on manufacturing growth The outlook for manufacturing is clouded by poor competitiveness, which has plagued the sector for many years. This is partly due to import competition-the Real was overvalued in 2005-12, during the commodity boom-as well as a legacy of high interest rates. Other persistent weaknesses include a heavy tax burden, poor infrastructure and high labour costs.
Light manufacturing in particular has lost market share in recent years, owing to a surge in Chinese imports. Capital goods industries have faced similar problems, but a robust labour market and the central bank's monetary easing cycle bode well for investment and consumer demand, supporting the sector. Higher investment will enable some labour-intensive manufacturing activities to move up the value chain, but many will struggle to cope with rising import competition. Brazil's manufacturing sector has been mostly inward-looking, and most firms have failed to develop linkages with global production chains. Nearshoring in Brazil has been limited. The country's geographical distance from developed markets makes it a less attractive nearshoring option than Mexico, for example, which has a similarly sophisticated industrial complex but benefits from proximity to the US.
The vehicles and parts industry, which accounts for about one-fifth of manufacturing and provides employment for more than 1m people, has been facing challenging conditions amid global semiconductor shortages that began in 2021 and will keep production subdued in the near term. We expect Brazil's annual vehicle output to recover to pre-pandemic levels this year (about 2.9m units), but it will remain below the 2012 peak of 3.4m units, as increasing trade restrictions amid US-China rivalry will make it difficult for Brazil to acquire the inputs required to increase production significantly. The electric-vehicle (EV) subsector is still nascent in Brazil; production is limited to commercial vehicles, batteries and some parts. However, there is significant investment in the sector, including US$600m from China's BYD (the world's largest electric car-maker), which is aiming to finalise the construction of a manufacturing plant for electric passenger and commercial vehicles with capacity to produce up to 150,000 vehicles per year in the state of Bahia by the end of 2024.
Mineral extraction will perform reasonably well in the medium term. Steady government-led stimulus in China (Brazil's main trading partner) will support mining activity in the near term (notably of iron ore), but China's secular economic slowdown will cloud the long-term outlook for Brazil's export commodities. Reforms to Brazil's mining law in 2018 that increased royalties for the government and improved the regulatory framework will boost investment in other mining activities.
The Brazilian government has recently eased regulations on lithium (which was previously considered a strategic metal), making exports of lithium viable. Brazil currently accounts for about 1.5% of global lithium production, but the Serviço Geológico do Brasil (SGB, the geological service) forecasts that the country could raise its share to 5% over the next decade, potentially enabling production of rechargeable batteries, especially for electric vehicles. Although Brazil is only a minor lithium producer at the moment, it has huge potential for growth, given that its deposits are easy to extract and that the country has favourable policies towards private investment.
Investment in oil and gas will continue to boost the sector's growth Vast oil and gas reserves could turn Brazil into one of the world's top ten oil exporters. At about 15.9bn barrels, Brazil has the second-largest oil reserves in South America (after Venezuela, with 303.8bn barrels). Oil production in Brazil has expanded significantly since the discovery of vast resources in the pre-salt oil region in 2006. Since then crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production has almost doubled, from 2.1m barrels/day to an estimated 4.1m b/d in 2023. We expect oil production to rise further in the medium term, reflecting increased private-sector led investments in the oil and gas industry and the fact that Petrobras (the state-controlled oil and gas company) plans to spend US$7.5bn on exploration over the next five years by drilling 50 wells in Brazil's offshore pre-salt areas. However, given that many of the deposits are adjacent to the mouth of the Amazon River, concerns about the environmental impact of these projects could cause delays in their implementation and preclude faster growth in oil production, adding downside risks. As at May 2024 Brazil had 19 refineries with a combined capacity of 2.4m b/d. Petrobras operates 90% of the national refinery capacity, and pre-salt oils represent about 60% of throughput at its refineries.
Following tepid growth of 2.4% in 2023, the services sector is likely to gain more dynamism over the medium term as the lagged effects of the central bank's monetary-easing cycle become more apparent and Brazil's tight labour market buoys household demand. However, low productivity and a lack of skilled labour are structural issues that will preclude faster growth in the services sector.
After a modest expansion in 2023, growth in retail sales will be stronger in the coming years as disinflation and a robust labour market boost real wages, lifting consumer demand. Private consumption will be supported by Bolsa Família (the government's conditional cash transfer programme for low-income Brazilians), minimum-wage rises and a household debt-structuring facilitation scheme for up to 30m Brazilians (the Desenrola programme).
Brazil's instant online payment system will spur economic dynamism Many consumers have traded down in recent years but will continue to shop across different channels, which poses challenges for retailers. Convenience stores will remain popular across income groups in urban areas, but young adults are increasingly making purchases using mobile devices. The use and popularity of Pix, an instant online payment system, has surged in recent years and will boost growth of online retail in the forecast period. Since its launch in 2020 Pix has garnered more than 163m users, surpassing credit and debit cards as the preferred method of payment. Pix is expanding its presence by enabling instantaneous cross-border payments, which will support growth in online sales across various categories of retail goods in the foreseeable future.

Headline inflation (3.7% in April) and inflation expectations are within the BCB's 1.5-4.5% target range. We expect inflation to ease over the forecast period, barring supply-side shocks (such as the recent flooding, which will lift food prices). Full convergence with the 3% mid-point target is unlikely, given Lula's moderately expansionary fiscal, quasi-fiscal and minimum-wage policies. A tight labour market could push services prices higher than we expect, lifting inflation above our forecasts. The other main risk is a surge in oil prices if the Israel-Hamas war were to escalate and spread across the Middle East.

The Real is coming under pressure from the BCB's easing cycle, which is narrowing interest-rate differentials with the US, and from the government's relaxation of medium-term fiscal targets. Some of this pressure should ease once the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) starts to reduce its policy rate in September. Overall, we expect the Real to weaken slightly over 2024-28. If the government delivers stronger fiscal results over the forecast period, the Real could appreciate, defying our expectation of long-term depreciation.

Although Brazil runs a sizeable current-account deficit, its structural trade surplus (stemming from huge agricultural exports), modest external debt ratio, solid foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and comfortable reserves cushion will limit risks to the external position. After a bumper harvest boosted the trade surplus, reducing the current-account deficit to 1.4% of GDP in 2023, we expect rising imports to cause the deficit to widen to 3.2% of GDP in 2028. FDI inflows will cover the shortfall, reflecting ample market opportunities. Public external debt is low, and although private external debt is moderate, most firms have some sort of currency hedge. Exports of agricultural goods and minerals, particularly to China, will keep the trade account in surplus throughout 2024-28.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Brazil Stocks and flows Brazil was the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region and ranked among the top ten globally in 2023. Total FDI inflows (including intercompany transfers and reinvested profits) stood at US$64.2bn (or 3% of GDP) in that year, slightly lower than the 2022 total of US$74.6bn (3.8% of GDP). Despite this moderation, which mostly reflects the aggressive 2021-22 monetary-tightening cycle, the latest figures indicate a firm recovery from the 2020-21 pandemic years, when inflows averaged US$42bn (2.7% of GDP). By end-2023 the FDI stock had reached an estimated US$1.2trn (54.4% of GDP).
Origin and distribution The US, the Netherlands and the UK have traditionally been the biggest investors (together accounting for about half of total FDI inflows in 2023). However, Chinese companies have entered the market in recent years, acquiring assets in electricity, infrastructure, oil and services, and more than doubling that country's share of total FDI inflows from less than 1% in 2012 to 2% in 2023. Other countries that invest significantly in Brazil are Singapore, Chile, Uruguay and Japan. From a sectoral perspective, inward FDI is relatively well distributed across agriculture (14% of total FDI inflows in 2023), industry (18.2%) and services (67%), reflecting opportunities in Brazil's broad-based economy.
Determinants Brazil's attractiveness to foreign investors has generally rested on the combination of its market size, macroeconomic stability, ample natural resources and diversified industrial base. The country is a major global player in agri-business, mineral commodities and bioenergy. However, its cumbersome tax system and relatively unstable legal framework have weighed on investor sentiment towards Brazil.
Impact FDI has played an increasingly prominent role in recent infrastructure concessions and in pre-salt oil rounds. In this sense, FDI is an important success factor in the promotion of capital productivity and sustained long-term growth. From a balance-of-payments perspective, FDI has fully covered the current-account deficit in recent years, allowing a healthy and balanced exchange between Brazil and the rest of the world. Although it is hard to measure the direct effects of FDI on productivity, it is clear that there is a positive correlation between the presence of international companies operating in Brazil and research and development activity: patents for inventions filed by non-residents through Brazilian offices reached 20,396 in 2023, far exceeding the 4,971 patents filed by residents.
Potential Brazil will remain an attractive destination for foreign investors in EIU's 2024-28 forecast period owing to its large market, but the favourable external environment of 2022-23-a product of high commodity prices, which buoyed interest in the country's export-oriented extractive industries and agriculture-will become less supportive as commodity prices soften. A narrower interest rate-differential with the US in 2024-25 will also remove a previous source of support, as the carry trade will become less attractive. On a positive note, in 2023 the government passed a long-awaited tax simplification reform, which will combine separate federal, state and municipal taxes into a dual value-added tax (VAT). Although the transition will occur gradually (the new tax regime is expected to be implemented fully by 2033), the modifications should eventually streamline the country's byzantine tax system, which has been considered one of the major barriers to investment. However, FDI inflows will remain below potential, based on the negative implications of the statist economic policies of the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, for the investment climate. There is even a risk that Lula will reverse some important privatisations (such as that of Eletrobras, a local electricity firm), although this is not our baseline assumption.

Demographic revisions could have implications for our forecasts An ageing population-the result of a declining birth rate and increasing life expectancy-will dampen Brazil's GDP growth potential. Preliminary results from the latest census, carried out in 2022, show that adverse demographic trends have accelerated in recent years. The census puts the population at 203.1m in 2022, much lower than the 214.8m initially estimated by the national statistics agency, which indicates that the birth rate has declined more than expected. EIU has not incorporated these lower figures into its demographic forecasts because the census results are still preliminary and subject to revisions. However, if the difference of 11.7m people is confirmed, there would be significant demographic implications that would affect our long-term economic forecasts.
A rising old-age dependency ratio will put pressure on Brazil's pension system Brazil's demographic dividend is fading quickly, and deteriorating dynamics will force the government to tackle the fiscal burden of an ageing population. There were 49.1m people in the country aged 0-14 (25.2% of the population) in 2010. We estimate that the share of the population in that age bracket fell to 20% in 2023. Meanwhile, the share of elderly people (those aged over 65) rose from 6.8% to 10.2% over the same period. Based on our current projections, the share of the population in that bracket will rise further, to 12.2% by 2028.
The ratio of the working-age population (15-64 years) to the total population is peaking; it has risen from 68% in 2010 to 69.8% as at 2023, but we expect it to slip to 69.1% in 2028; as a result, we forecast that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of elderly people to working-age people) will reach 18% in 2028, from 15% in 2023. This means that Brazilian workers will come under much stronger pressure to finance an increasing number of pension beneficiaries. Productivity gains in the labour market will be insufficient to make up for this extra burden, as the education and skills levels of the workforce are low and are unlikely to improve significantly over the next decade.
Solving the pension system imbalance by raising taxes or through labour contributions would be costly and counterproductive. Brazil's tax burden is already heavy; additional tax increases would raise production costs, deter private investment, lift unemployment and ultimately hinder consumption growth and revenue collection. In sum, Brazil's demographic transition will challenge the fiscal and financial sustainability of the country's current pay-as-you-go pension system, even after a landmark pension reform in 2019. Another attempt at reform-to either the raise retirement age, cut benefits or both-will be needed in the next five to ten years and will carry risks of social unrest.
The growing share of older people will weigh on the public healthcare system Population ageing does not only affect the social security system but also adds to pressure on the healthcare system by increasing medical and hospital costs. Brazil has one of the largest public healthcare systems in the world. The country's 1988 constitution made healthcare universal and decentralised (basic care is the responsibility of municipalities, and more intensive and complex procedures fall under the purview of Brazil's states). However, even before covid-19, growing demand had made for an overstretched system, particularly after the 2014-16 economic crisis, when many people migrated from private healthcare insurance (mostly through company schemes) to public health services. Population ageing will exacerbate this situation and will stretch already-thin budgets.
Labour productivity gains will not offset adverse demographic trends Given the speed of the demographic transition and the pressure that it will put on the pension and healthcare systems, labour productivity would have to rise materially in the long term to compensate for the rising old-age dependency ratio. The education system remains precarious and is unable to produce enough skilled workers, even though Brazil spends 6% of its GDP on education (above the OECD average of 3-4% of GDP). Immigration could go some way towards offsetting population ageing, but the government has not laid out any policies to attract skilled labour and is unlikely to do so in the near future. Most recent immigrants to Brazil (primarily from South Korea, China, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela) have been absorbed into low-skilled roles in the retail and services sectors, rather than into industry, where most demand for high-skilled labour is concentrated.

After falling out of the list of the world's top ten largest economies (at market exchange rates) in 2020 amid the pandemic-induced recession, Brazil returned to this group in 2023. GDP recovered to US$2.2trn in 2023, making Brazil the world's ninth-biggest economy and the largest in Latin America. Based on a population of about 210.4m people (the seventh-largest globally), EIU forecasts that GDP per head will come in at US$10,770 (at market exchange rates) in 2024 and then reach US$11,200 by 2025, making Brazil an upper-middle-income country and the 60th-70th richest in the world (depending on the metrics used).
When measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, per-head income is higher and will rise from US$20,670 in 2024 to US$24,120 by 2028. The divergence between GDP per head measured by market rates and by PPP reflects the fact that, in emerging economies such as Brazil, lower wages make prices of services and non-traded goods relatively cheap by comparison with richer countries. Given that services account for about two-thirds of GDP, per-head income measured by the PPP exchange rate tends to be higher than at the market exchange rate.
Household consumption is high, but savings are low The relatively low median household income (forecast at just over US$13,000 in 2024) results in a high marginal propensity to spend more and save less. According to a 2023 study by the Associação Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais (the financial and capital markets association), about half of the Brazilian population does not have any financial investments, partly because the pandemic prompted households to liquidate investments, and partly because overall levels of financial literacy are low. The high share of income diverted to consumption means that household consumption represents about 63.1% the country's total GDP. Government consumption is fairly high for a developing country, at almost one-fifth of GDP. Meanwhile, savings and investments are low, with gross fixed investments representing only 16.5% of GDP. Even in families that save some of their income, most allocate it to conservative instruments, primarily savings accounts with low or below-inflation interest rates (real savings interest rates are negative). A lack of knowledge about financial products also explains the low levels of savings; most families do not receive much extra income from financial returns.
Low levels of savings reduce the amount of financial guarantees and collateral that households can use to borrow from banks. This helps to explain why total domestic credit extended by banks to the private sector represents nearly 70% of GDP in Brazil. Consumption is concentrated on goods and services that are less dependent on credit, such as non-durable goods (food and beverages, and health and beauty products) and semi-durable goods (clothing, household goods and electronic equipment). Consumption of durable goods, such as automobiles and housing (which often rely on access to financing), have been dependent on government stimulus programmes, as illustrated in consumer and credit trends during the boom and bust cycle of 2003-14.
E-commerce is strong and is set to grow further in 2024-28 The same patterns are reflected in e-commerce, but the outlook for this segment is rosier. After a pandemic-related surge in online sales, nearly half of Brazilians (105m) now shop online. Purchases using hand-held devices are common, as smartphone usage and mobile-phone penetration are high. The country's high level of urbanisation (87%, which is well above the global average of 57%) and strong mobile and internet adoption (87% and 81% respectively in 2023) augur well for growth in online retail. As at January 2024 about 65% of Brazil's population was able to access 5G. Another positive factor is that Pix, an instant online payment system, is rapidly expanding its presence by enabling cross-border payments, which will support growth in online sales across various categories of retail goods. We expect online retail sales as a share of total sales to exceed 20% in 2028 (up from 5.5% in 2019).

The economy will remain vulnerable to adverse weather conditions After a record grains harvest helped GDP to expand by 2.9% in 2023, we forecast that economic growth will soften to 2% in 2024, reflecting a moderation in the global economy, a slight contraction in the agriculture sector (given the high base of 2023) and economic damage caused by unprecedented flooding in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in April-May 2024. Pronounced income disparities make for regional variation in growth dynamics. Brazil is made up of 26 states-plus the capital district of Brasília-divided into five regions. The wealthy southern states will do better than the rest, given that they specialise in agro-industry, which will hold up better than manufacturing and services. Similarly, the Centre-West-Brazil's agricultural belt-specialises in livestock, grains (soybean and corn) and cotton, which will be resilient in the long term. The Southeast region, home to Brazil's largest city, São Paulo, will benefit from its diversified industrial, agricultural and services base. Meanwhile, the poorer North and Northeast regions will suffer from a lack of skilled labour and archaic infrastructure, although the industrial production of durable and semi-durable goods in the Manaus Free-Trade Zone (in the North) and agriculture and mining (in the Northeast) will keep a floor under economic activity.

Limited reforms and an ageing population will weigh on the outlook EIU expects Brazil's annual GDP growth to slip to 1.8% on average in the long-term forecast period (2024-50), largely owing to the end of the country's demographic dividend, persistent skills shortages in the workforce and limited structural reforms. Growth will therefore be much weaker than in 1991-2014, when a low base (owing to a recession and a period of hyperinflation in the 1980s) and the commodities boom of the 2000s and 2010s sustained average growth of 3%. Our growth forecast for 2031-50 assumes that labour productivity growth will accelerate beyond recent historical levels but that it will be offset by adverse demographic trends. Our model also assumes that growth in the capital stock and in labour productivity will remain relatively firm on the back of improvements in innovation and technology. Faster growth could be achieved if policy improvements and structural reforms exceed expectations.
Initial conditions: Brazil has vast natural resource potential and a young labour force, but structural constraints-including weak political effectiveness, generally low levels of education and skills, income disparities, low savings rates, chronic underinvestment in infrastructure and heavy public debt-will partly offset these advantages. Other than in the agricultural sector, productivity growth has been modest in recent years, even though the manufacturing sector took advantage of exchange-rate appreciation during the boom years to boost imports of more advanced machinery and equipment. Gradual improvements in the quality and availability of primary and secondary education, along with efforts to address infrastructure deficiencies, simplify Brazil's cumbersome tax regime and reduce red tape, will underpin stronger productivity growth in the long term. Our projections are based on the expectation that commitment to fiscal and monetary orthodoxy will prevail.
Demographic trends: Brazil's demographic dividend is likely to end in the coming decade. The demographic profile will become less supportive of growth prospects as the population ages, but the median age of the population will still be low compared with the US, western European countries and Japan. We estimate that population growth started to outpace working-age growth in 2023 and we expect that trend to continue in the long term, forcing policymakers to revise the pension system in order to alleviate the fiscal burden of a growing number of retirees.
External conditions: Brazil's economy is exposed to changes in external financial market conditions owing to its low domestic savings rates, and the volume of external capital inflows is strongly correlated with risk aversion. Although the public sector has been cautious about external borrowing, corporates have borrowed overseas and can be affected by sudden stops in capital flows. Progress on increasing trade openness and diversifying export partners will allow the country to benefit from global trade growth. Brazil's strong competitive advantage in agricultural production and its large industrial export base provide partial insulation from commodity price shocks. Global trade liberalisation is unlikely to make much headway; combined with rising international pressure to contain deforestation, this will prevent Brazil from realising its full export potential, particularly in the agricultural sector.
Institutions and policy trends: Brazil's democracy has strengthened since the reinstatement of civilian rule in 1985. However, many political institutions are still ineffective, and the political spectrum is fragmented into several relatively weak parties, producing a legislature that is dominated by pork-barrel politics, graft and vested interests. The situation will improve slightly in the long term, assuming that efforts to enhance party loyalty and electoral measures to reduce the number of political parties in Congress materialise. Fiscal pressures will mount, despite efforts to pass reforms to cap the growth of spending related to benefits and entitlements enshrined in the 1988 constitution, especially as the population ages. Tax revenue is already high, at about a quarter of GDP, which means that adjusting the public finances to stabilise and reduce Brazil's high public debt/GDP ratio (at 74.4% in 2023) will prove challenging. A heavy debt burden will keep interest payments high, crowding out the private sector. Our long-term growth forecasts assume slow improvements in the business environment through the gradual implementation of structural reforms (as demonstrated by the recent approval of a reform to simplify Brazil's byzantine tax system). These will help to compensate for other constraints on GDP growth, including an unskilled labour market and archaic infrastructure. Even so, we expect it to take until after 2030 for structural reforms to start to improve Brazil's relative attractiveness for investors.
Long-term performance: Brazil will struggle to gain much ground on the US; its GDP per head (in US dollars at purchasing power parity) will amount to 26.4% of the US's figure in 2050. Although macroeconomic stability will smooth volatility in economic growth, our forecast for GDP expansion of a tepid average of 1.8% per year in the 2024-50 long-term forecast period will be considerably weaker than the historical annual average of 3% in 1991-2014. Improvements in infrastructure, trade expansion, the broader presence of multinational businesses and a reduction in the debt-service burden will mitigate slower labour force growth and should help to lift labour productivity growth. However, this depends on progress in the politically difficult process of structural and institutional reforms.
Our outlook assumes that governments remain broadly committed to pushing through changes over the long term: otherwise, productivity growth and average GDP growth rates will fall short of our already-lacklustre forecasts. The country's political system makes it hard to advance structural reforms. Political reforms could improve the situation, although these appear unlikely. Given that our forecasts already account for productivity gains attached to the 2023 tax simplification reform and the commercial exploitation of the proceeds of Brazil's ample reserves of deepwater oil, major setbacks on any of these fronts would pose a downside risk to our projections.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Environmental protection is back, but risks remain Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of weather events, be they droughts or floods. For Brazil, adverse weather conditions will directly affect long-term growth in view of the importance of agriculture to the economy. Industry and services are also at risk, as seen in mid-2024, when heavy rains led to unprecedented flooding in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, causing severe damage to infrastructure and obstructing the movement of goods and services. Besides displacing more than 600,000 people, the flooding caused economic damage of about R62bn (US$11.9bn), according to official government estimates. Other structural weaknesses include Brazil's reliance on water-based energy, given that hydroelectric power accounts for nearly 57% of the total energy matrix, leaving the country vulnerable to drought risks. In addition, more than a quarter of the Brazilian population lives on the coast, meaning that rising sea levels could cause mass migration and catastrophic infrastructure damage. As home to 60% of the Amazon (the world's largest rainforest), Brazil has a leading role in combating climate change-a mantle that it has taken up again under the left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who returned to power in January 2023.
Lula is reversing the anti-environmental policies of his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), and has promised to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2030. To that end, Lula has reinforced monitoring and introduced punitive measures against those engaging in illegal deforestation. Early indications show that his efforts are paying off; according to the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (the space research institute), illegal deforestation in the Amazon region fell by 50% in annual terms during Lula's first year in office.
Lula's other measures to reduce deforestation include re-establishing the Amazon Fund (suspended in 2019), through which some Western countries sponsor the preservation of the rainforest. He also has removed expenditure related to international donations for the environment from his new fiscal spending cap rules and is increasing the number of public servants in important environmental agencies.
Another boost for Lula's environmental credentials came with the selection of Belém, the capital of Pará state (in the Amazon region), as host for the COP30 conference, which will take place in 2025. This will be Brazil's first opportunity to host a COP summit and symbolises the country's return to the international stage as an important actor in the fight against climate change.
Brazil is gearing up to launch its first digital currency
A technological revolution in Brazil's financial sector will support the country's long-term growth and open up new avenues for innovation in e-commerce. Open-banking reforms and the launch of Pix (a digital payment system) in 2020 by the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) will provide opportunities for increased competition in Brazil's highly concentrated banking system. This mostly reflects the fact that Pix allows individuals to make instant digital payments and transfer money for free, promoting financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs. It also dents traditional bank profits by almost eliminating fees from wire transfers. Since its launch, demand for Pix has been robust. The platform has garnered more than 163m users, surpassing credit and debit cards as the preferred method of payment. The daily average volume of transactions reached an all-time high of about R49bn (US$9.8bn) in April 2024.
Looking ahead, open-banking regulations are likely to follow, and the BCB is aiming to launch its own central bank digital currency, the Drex, by end-2024. The Drex will complement the circulation of traditional money and promises to reduce operational costs, increase financial inclusion, and make wholesale and retail transactions more secure. Although the Drex pilot programme is in its final stages, EIU expects the launch to be delayed until early 2025, as regulatory agencies still need to outline the new legal framework for the digital currency and its infrastructure.
Whereas Pix is an instant payment system focused on retail transactions, the Drex is the digital representation of the Brazilian currency, the Real. The use of blockchain technology, as is the case for cryptocurrencies, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) will provide greater security and transparency, helping to spur confidence in the Drex. However, unlike cryptocurrencies, which are unregulated and decentralised, the Drex will be regulated and its value guaranteed by the BCB, meaning that its value will be stabilised, equal to the Brazilian Real. These features will make the Drex more suitable for carrying out the larger transactions that are required in wholesale and government operations. As a result, we expect the Drex to be used to price assets, conduct streamlined cross asset operations without intermediaries, facilitate international transactions and automate contracts, all to the benefit of the Brazil's business environment.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Bola Tinubu, who took office as president at end-May, embarked rapidly on a series of pro-market reforms, including the floating of the naira and an end to a costly petrol subsidy, which has since been partly reversed. Although welcomed by investors and multilateral creditors, the moves have received a hostile reception from labour unions and the wider public. Mr Tinubu will focus in his first term on trying to conserve these policies (with mixed success) rather than broadening the push towards a less statist economic model. Insecurity will be rampant, with the security forces unable to overcome multiple security crises in different parts of the country.
- An implicit petrol subsidy has already returned to placate Nigeria's powerful trade unions, but an intense cost-of-living crisis will lead to relatively frequent bouts of industrial action, at times paralysing critical infrastructure. In terms of the exchange rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria has been attempting a fully market-led currency but is likely to end up operating a managed float. EIU expects the currency to broadly depreciate over our 2024-28 forecast period.
- Inflation will remain well above the 6-9% target range throughout the 2024-28 forecast period. The government's pro-growth policies, fiscal dominance and weak central bank independence will prevent Nigeria from reaching the target. However, we expect budget reforms under Mr Tinubu to reduce reliance on central bank finance, reducing what had been rapid growth in the money supply under his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari.
- We expect Mr Tinubu to run an expansionary fiscal policy both to stimulate growth and to shield segments of the population affected by market reform (notably higher petrol prices) through higher spending on wages and the social safety net. This will result in wide budget deficits (by Nigerian standards) throughout the forecast period.
- Economic growth will stay well below potential in 2024-28, reaching a peak of 3.5% in 2025 as a tight monetary policy is unwound. Extreme insecurity, a highly challenging business environment and a giant infrastructure gap will be the main constraints on growth.
- We expect a current-account surplus to last throughout 2024-28 but narrow later in the forecast period. A more market-led naira will prevent the build-up of wide imbalances, especially on the services account, and the ramp-up of a new mega-refinery will displace fuel imports and promote exports. The surplus will shrink as the forecast period progresses while international oil prices decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens in 2024-28 as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, Nigeria's global ranking remains poor, and the regional ranking falls.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Policy is aimed at being pro-business, and trade barriers to foreign competition are removed.
2026-28: The non-oil sector is largely shielded from external competition, but NNPC Limited, the state oil company, prepares for partial privatisation (probably through an initial public offering).
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: The exchange-rate unification brings in more foreign direct investment, but the impact is minor in the absence of wider reforms.
2026-28: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, but concerted efforts are made to commercialise the national oil company (which is in joint ventures with multinationals).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Current-account restrictions are eased, and progress is made in clearing a backlog of foreign-exchange orders.
2026-28: Foreign-exchange shortages re-emerge as oil prices slide, heightening the risk of capital controls and other convertibility restrictions.
Taxes 2024-25: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, accompanied by tax increases, even though the weak state of the economy, amid hard-biting economic reforms and a high cost of living, weighs on enforcement.
2026-28: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is raised from 7.5% to 15% to cut the budget deficit and manage debt-service costs.
Financing 2024-25: The government seeks liquidity support from multinationals, but the international capital market remains off limits for the sovereign until 2025. A large budget deficit crowds out private-sector lending.
2026-28: Higher tax revenue limits recourse to fiscal deficit financing via central bank overdrafts.
The labour market 2024-25: Employers face major problems, lay off staff to reduce costs and raise wages to compensate for a sharp rise in the cost of living to retain highly skilled employees.
2026-28: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff and face high costs from retaining skilled workers. Unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2024-25: A large private refinery starts operating, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependence on imported petrol.
2026-28: Public investment in infrastructure lags budgeted levels and the rate needed to plug the infrastructure gap.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2026-28: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010 his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second and final term in early 2019. In the February 2023 election the presidency was won by Bola Tinubu, who ran on the ruling party ticket.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) was the predominant political force until the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress (APC). With Mr Buhari at the helm, the APC had enough heft to take power in 2015, secure re-election in 2019 and win again in 2023 under Mr Tinubu.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and high unemployment.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, amendments to consumer taxes, specifically value-added tax (VAT, 7.5% currently), are likely.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. Massive infrastructure deficiencies have rendered the non-oil export base globally uncompetitive. The launch of the Dangote oil refinery will reduce petroleum imports and lead to more exports of refined products. The large currency devaluation will also weigh on imports, keeping the current account in surplus throughout 2024-28.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability EIU expects Nigeria's president, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to remain in power until at least 2027, when his first term ends, but his time in office will be highly challenging. Despite having a weak mandate-only 8.8m Nigerians voted for him out of a population of 220m-Mr Tinubu has embarked on the biggest economic shake-up in a generation, rapidly rolling out market reforms and dismantling vehicles for patronage and corruption. On coming to power, Mr Tinubu moved quickly to scrap a petrol subsidy and float the currency. In theory, these reforms are needed to put Nigeria on a higher growth path, but implementation has been hasty, and inflation has risen to decades-long highs.
As the cause of cost-of-living pressures can be traced directly back to policy, we expect a sustained risk of mass protests and repeated trade union-led walkouts during the first half of Mr Tinubu's term. Failed negotiations about a higher minimum wage led to "indefinite" and crippling strike action by major trade unions in early June. Although the wage demand is too high to be fiscally affordable, the government will not be able to refuse union demands entirely and has a track record of buckling (petrol subsidies have surreptitiously returned, for example). Given the underlying weakness of the Tinubu administration, a pattern of repeated concession-making could emerge to undermine the wider reform push further. Acceding to wage demands for short-term relief will come at the cost of protracted high inflation, which is arguably the most significant underlying risk to Nigeria's overall political stability.
Widespread, entrenched poverty is compounding discontent with economic policy, and ethno-religious divides (stemming from largely unsolvable issues such as high population growth and natural resource depletion) put Nigeria's entire federal structure at risk. Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province, two Islamist terrorist groups, will continue to present a threat in north-eastern and parts of central Nigeria, and tension between farmers and herdsmen in the Middle Belt agricultural heartland is another source of violent conflict. In recent years banditry and kidnapping in the north-east have become a destabilising national crisis. In the oil-producing Niger Delta, mistrust of the government runs deep and communities feel that they do not get their fair share of Nigeria's oil wealth. Criminal activity linked to militant groups will continue to disrupt oil production and exports, at times seriously so.
With the security forces overstretched, emergencies will be triaged. Our baseline assumption is that Nigeria's federal government will assert control over "core" areas such as Abuja, the capital, and other places of political importance, at the expense of "periphery" regions that have long been mired in conflict. This will be enough to keep the seat of power safe, but governance will be minimal across much of the country.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch The next presidential election is due in 2027. Nigeria has a highly fractured party political system, in which party allegiances are more often a matter of political convenience than ideology. Mr Tinubu's victory in the first round of the February 2023 presidential election, with only 36.6% of the popular vote, highlights disenchantment with the major parties. The ruling APC scraped a majority in the Senate but fell short in the lower house. The third-placed presidential candidate, Peter Obi, who stood for the Labour Party and won 25.4% of the vote, sought to capitalise on popular dissatisfaction. We believe that Mr Obi will pose a major challenge to Mr Tinubu at the next presidential election.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Given its size, Nigeria is a major power in Africa, but its clout in West Africa is waning. A relatively weak economy, coupled with domestic security challenges, means that the country can no longer credibly underwrite regional security, as it had in the past. Nigeria can still count on strong relations with the West and multilateral organisations and, if needed, could tap into IMF funds, given market reforms under Mr Tinubu. We do not expect this, as in our view, the government will want policy latitude. The US has been a major arms supplier to Nigeria, and is likely to maintain some security assistance, given the wider regional threats posed by Islamist radical groups.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends Mr Tinubu's two flagship policies, the elimination of petrol subsidies and the liberalisation of the exchange rate, have an inner contradiction. As Nigeria imports virtually all of its fuel, devaluations of the naira-the latest of which was a 45% drop in February-should be reflected in the pump price. However, owing to the threat of industrial action, petrol prices have been capped since June, despite a 20% increase in international oil prices and sizable devaluations of the naira. The return of a petrol subsidy underlines the political limits to the reform drive.
Following record losses in 2023 and early 2024, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), under new leadership, has successfully consolidated the foreign exchange market. However, a "willing buyer, willing seller" system for foreign exchange is in its infancy and will be subject to periodic setbacks. High inflation and the threat of industrial action will create a strong temptation to return to heavier management, as exchange-rate pass-through has a heavy influence on domestic price dynamics. Another test will be a gradual decline in international oil prices later in the forecast period, which will restrict market liquidity. Reform drives have a cyclical aspect in Nigeria and are often subject to reversal depending on domestic and external economic conditions. The CBN is expected to become more interventionist in the medium term, leading to a more strongly managed float, and the risk of convertibility restrictions being imposed later in the forecast period cannot be ruled out.
To attract foreign investment and cement a recovery of the naira, the CBN is reasserting its commitment to its price stability mandate after several years of deficit monetisation (in 2015-23). Buttressing market confidence and attracting a wave of portfolio investment-a primary goal of the CBN-would probably hinge on a positive real policy rate. However, a public financial trade-off will complicate the path to monetary orthodoxy. We expect reasonably wide budget deficits, and fiscal flexibility will be constrained by a debt service/revenue ratio of 60-80%, limiting the CBN's scope to sustain a tight stance without interfering with fiscal objectives. We also expect there to be wider political resistance to monetary policies that slow growth and raise unemployment.
As central bank independence has not been established, the subordination of monetary policy to fiscal policy is likely to be a lasting theme over 2024-28. Mr Tinubu's economic plan revolves around job creation and rapid growth in GDP, which will sit uneasily with a strict approach to inflation. The government's fiscal footprint is small, placing an onus on the CBN to drive economic development, and the president has expressed a desire for interest rates to be low. If a wage-price spiral was to solidify as a result of trade union pressure-not a core forecast-there would be insufficient institutional safeguards against resumed deficit monetisation to finance higher spending on wages.
Despite Nigeria's enormous market potential, a giant infrastructure deficit in the transport, connectivity and power supply sectors, alongside high levels of corruption and instability, will be lasting impediments to the business environment and foreign direct investment (FDI). We expect divestment in the short term after devaluations of the naira caused balance-sheet deterioration for several multinationals. In the longer term more FDI will be held back by oil majors selling down their (often high-emitting) onshore assets to local companies that will be unable to match the investing power of outgoing multinationals. We expect the larger offshore oil sector to remain attractive, driving incremental increases in output, but production will stay below OPEC+ quotas and pre-pandemic levels. We forecast that crude oil production will rise from 1.23m barrels/day (b/d) in 2023 to 1.4m b/d in 2028, still 318,000 b/d below output in 2019.
The new, 650,000-b/d Dangote mega-refinery will materially improve Nigeria's external balance when it reaches capacity. The facility is gearing up for its first fuel exports, to be followed by cargoes to the domestic market. In theory, the facility can meet all domestic needs, but an ongoing subsidy makes it unclear whether doing so will be profitable (let alone profit maximising) for petrol. It also appears likely that the ramp-up to full capacity will be slower than initially thought, judging by current reported production levels and the type of products being supplied. We expect full capacity in late 2025 or in 2026.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy We expect a wide budget deficit throughout 2024-28, owing to high levels of spending on wages and social welfare designed to help the passage of market reforms by softening their impact, as well as interest costs and an unofficially reinstated petrol subsidy. This will lead to debt accumulation over the forecast period.
The 2024 budget includes a large increase in non-debt recurrent spending as high inflation necessitates public-sector salary increases and cash transfers to poor households. We forecast a fiscal deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2024, down slightly from 4.9% of GDP in 2023 owing to higher international oil prices. We expect the deficit to average 4.6% of GDP a year in 2025-28, exceeding the legal limit of 3% of GDP and representing an unusually lax period of fiscal policy for Nigeria. Outlays on debt service, inflexible primary expenditure categories such as wages and social spending, as well as petrol and electricity subsidies and infrastructure will underpin the highest spending/GDP ratio since the early 2000s, and declining international prices will partly offset non-oil revenue gains.
The government has stated that its revenue focus is squarely on efficiency, but a broad culture of tax evasion and the limited capacity of the Federal Inland Revenue Service are expected to force the government to implement direct tax rises. We expect this to be funded by incremental increases in the value-added tax (VAT) rate, from 7.5% to 15% by 2028.
Relatively wide deficits (including a primary shortfall), coupled with the issue of bonds to repay past monetary finance and revaluation effects on foreign debt, have led to the public debt/GDP ratio exceeding a self-imposed ceiling of 40%. We expect a ratio of 42.3% by end-2024, rising to 53.7% by end-2028.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy Since the beginning of 2024 the CBN has raised the policy rate by a cumulative 750 basis-points, to a record 26.25%. The cash reserve requirement has also been raised, by 1,250 basis-points, to 45%, and a minimum loan-to-deposit ratio of 65%-a driver behind high levels of credit growth-was cut to 50%. As inflation is running far higher than the policy rate, and as pressure on the naira continues, we expect another increase, of 100 basis points, to the policy rate in July. A tight stance will need to be maintained well into 2025 as inflation expectations are kept high by wage rises and the CBN's low credibility, which will be slow to rebuild from a clear inflation bias and eroded independence under the former governor (2014-23).
Although the CBN is attempting to switch to an inflation-targeting system to convince the market about constrained discretion in policymaking, political interference will remain an issue. We do not expect the CBN to be able to adopt strict inflation targeting, owing to fiscal dominance and an economic policy that focuses on growth. Assuming that disinflation is entrenched, we expect the CBN to begin unwinding its tight stance from late 2025. We expect the policy rate to fall to 14% by end-2026, despite inflation remaining above the 6-9% target range, and to 12% in 2028.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth Nigeria's economic growth will slow from 2.9% in 2023 to 2.6% in 2024 as the economy continues to adjust to market reforms introduced in 2023. These have ushered in a period of high inflation, necessitating tight credit conditions, and domestic demand will contract for a third consecutive year in 2024. Given population growth of 2.4%, this will be an unusually long stretch of decline. Net exports will be the main driver of growth as output from the Dangote refinery reduces fuel imports and increases fuel exports (although full capacity is some way off).
As inflation falls and monetary policy becomes expansionary from 2025, domestic demand will return to (low) growth. Real GDP growth will quicken to 3.5% in that year-the second-highest rate in a decade-owing in part to rebound effects and continued ramp-up of the Dangote refinery. Growth will gradually slow in 2026-28, averaging 3.2% a year, as global oil prices decline, reducing economy-wide multiplier effects from the oil industry. Factors such as power outages, rampant insecurity, a lack of land titling and a giant infrastructure gap will hold back the economy.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation Inflation reached 33.7% year on year in April as the February currency devaluation continues to work through the system. The rate is likely to peak from mid-year as a trebling of fuel prices in mid-2023 drops from the inflation calculation, but food price growth-a leading driver of inflation-will be sticky downwards as a result of low agricultural output, transport bottlenecks and severe currency volatility.
Assuming that the naira finds a point of relatively stability in 2025, average inflation will ease in that year, to 22%, declining to 11.7% in 2028. Rates consistently above the 6-9% target range reflect fiscal dominance and a wider growth bias in policymaking, VAT rate increases, insecurity in agricultural regions (raising food prices) and a large infrastructure deficit. New inflationary surges are possible, especially if the government reverts to chronic overuse of its overdraft with the central bank to finance relatively large fiscal deficits.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates Foreign-exchange market reform took a major step forward in February 2024, with a massive devaluation-the second since mid-2023-as part of the shift to a floating currency. The spread with the black market (which had been as high as 60%) has largely collapsed. However, the naira currently stands as the most volatile currency in the world, with daily movements of up to 9% against the US dollar. Swings are tied largely to shifting sentiment among speculators, and it seems likely that fitful interventions by the CBN have played an additional role. Tightening credit conditions domestically and interest-rate cuts in the US from mid-year will offer support, and our end-2024 forecast for the naira at N1,300:US$1 is moderately stronger than the current level, although we expect severe volatility in the interim. We forecast that the currency will end 2025 at N1,390:US$1, marking greater stability as continued ramped-up output at the Dangote refinery reduces foreign-exchange demand.
We believe that a lax monetary-fiscal policy mix, relatively low foreign reserves and high inflation will undermine the longer-term value of the naira. Given this, and a slide in international oil prices, we forecast that the currency will end 2028 at N1,953:US$1, with a 5-10% spread with the parallel-market rate.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector The impact of steep real-terms naira losses against trading partner currencies and high global oil prices will be reflected in a widening of the current-account surplus to 2.7% of GDP in 2024. Remittances through official channels will also rise after alignment between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates. A surplus averaging 2.4% of GDP in 2025-26 will be supported by the Dangote refinery as some fuel imports will be displaced and over time higher-value-added products will be exported.
Thereafter, a more flexible currency will keep the (typically large) services deficit in-check but declining international oil prices and slow gains in crude production will take their toll on the trade balance, shrinking the overall current account surplus to 0.2% of GDP by 2028. Surpluses will be supportive of Nigeria's foreign reserve position, and we project import cover to average 6.9 months over 2024-28.

Full text: - Turkey's shift to a presidential republic was concluded in 2018 with the re-election of Recep Tayyip Erdogan as president. Mr Erdogan was re-elected again in May 2023, and his ruling alliance won a majority in parliament at the same time. EIU expects Mr Erdogan to continue to make most decisions himself, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. He has tightened his grip on national institutions and the media, and will continue to dominate Turkish politics.
- Declining trust in the US and the EU has incentivised the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to pursue a "Turkey first" approach to foreign relations, closer ties with Russia, and its ambition to make Turkey a regional power. Turkey is at odds with its neighbours in the eastern Mediterranean over maritime borders and offshore gas reserves. Given the economy's fragility, and Turkey's close relations with Russia and Ukraine, Mr Erdogan is attempting a balancing act between NATO and Russia.
- Domestic political tensions, fraught foreign relations and years of irrational economic policies have jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its previous electoral success. A slow return towards more rational economic policies under the new administration has started. These new policies will include policy rate increases and a more conservative approach to fiscal policy in an attempt to improve credibility with foreign investors. We also expect interest-rate and exchange-rate controls to be loosened, resulting in faster lira depreciation in the near term.
- Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and market volatility, owing to a prudent approach to the public finances, effective capitalisation of the banking sector, and a dynamic and diversified private sector. Following real GDP growth 5.7% in 2022, we estimate slowdown to 4.5% in 2023. We forecast average annual growth of 3.3% in our forecast period (2024-28), which is short of the government's annual 5% target but close to Turkey's medium-term potential.
- Turkey's heavy reliance on often volatile, short-term capital inflows to fund lending and drive economic growth leaves the economy vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Although capital inflows are improving and foreign-exchange reserves are picking up, investor sentiment remains weak. The risk of a balance-of-payments crisis remains high.

- The business environment score for Turkey is lower in the forecast period than in the historical period (2019-23). Turkey falls ten places in the global ranking, to 56th, and one place to the bottom (18th) of the regional ranking.

Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The private sector benefits from incentives and support, but political bias, state enterprises, informality and intellectual property rights issues detract from free competition. Perception of corruption is high.
2026-28: Competition remains limited and/or state ownership continues to play an important role in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Turkey actively seeks foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in prioritised sectors, although the few existing restrictions remain in place.
2026-28: FDI remains a priority. FDI affecting natural resources or requiring special concessions may still face opposition.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The customs union with the EU largely dictates Turkey's trade policies, but tariff and non-tariff protection against imports of various products from non-EU countries without free-trade agreements continues.
2026-28: Exporters adjust to the EU "green deal". Politics permitting, talks on updating and expanding customs union begin.
Taxes 2024-25: Tax rates remain higher than in the past; for example some taxes on wealth may be increased. Efforts are made to reduce tax avoidance. Proposals are made to simplify incentives and increase the share of direct taxation.
2026-28: Tax reforms and anti-informality measures succeed only partially. Social-security deficit becomes more pressing.
Financing 2024-25: Banks manage their risks, but tighter monetary policies curb credit growth, while high inflation limits long-term lending. The authorities try to direct lending towards investments in digitalisation, greening and other priority areas.
2026-28: Financial conditions may ease. State banks still play a big role. Capital markets are promoted.
The labour market 2024-25: There is an ample supply of labour, but skill levels are mixed. The minimum wage keeps pace with inflation.
2026-28: Reforms to promote flexible employment remain incomplete or have a limited impact. Efforts continue to reduce informality and tackle skills gaps. The 2028 elections could be preceded by increases in real wages.
Infrastructure 2024-25: The Istanbul Airport expansion and the country's first nuclear reactor are operational. Black Sea gas production reaches full capacity. Earthquake-affected infrastructure is rebuilt. Other infrastructure investment is limited.
2026-28: Internet speeds improve. 5G mobile is rolled out. There is patchy progress on all forms of transport, nuclear and renewable energy, power supplies, and urban infrastructure. Vulnerability to earthquakes remains a critical issue.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Internet infrastructure and speeds improve. E-commerce grows. Research and development spending is moderate.
2026-28: High-tech industrial products increase. Businesses make wider use of IT, including AI.

a EIU estimates.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade. Under current political circumstances accession will not be possible in 2024-28.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited, and its secular character has been weakened by the religious-conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule. There was a failed coup in July 2016. Turkey has a presidential system of government, in place since the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, changed the parliamentary system in 2018, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan, the AKP leader, who was re-elected for a third presidential term in May 2023.
Policy issues: The focus since mid-2023 has been on dismantling the irrational economic programme that started in 2021, characterised by ultra-low policy rates. The new economic programme emphasises the need for economic orthodoxy-including tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms-which will reassure investors. However, the process of rebalancing the economy comes with risk and will be gradual in order to prevent potential financial sector problems stemming from corporate and household debt levels. Negative real interest rates and political risk make attracting adequate capital inflows challenging, which means that risks of further lira sell-offs and a balance-of-payments crisis will persist. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is an important challenge. Politicisation of the judiciary has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was reverted back to 25% in 2023, up from 23% in 2022 and 25% in 2021. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 40%. The top marginal tax rate applies to 2023 incomes of more than TL1.9m (about US$60,000). Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2023 goods exports totalled US$250.8bn and imports about US$337.7bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$86.9bn. The current-account deficit reached an estimated US$45bn, or 4.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability Recep Tayyip Erdogan will remain in power until at least the next election, scheduled for 2028. The alliance led by Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a majority in parliament in May 2023, which will support political stability over EIU's forecast period. We expect consolidation of the country's centralised system of government and a reinforcement of conservative autocratic trends. Mr Erdogan will continue to make most decisions, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. The executive presidential system already grants extensive powers to the president, including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary. We expect Mr Erdogan to continue to restrict political dissent and media freedom, and to stifle the opposition.
Mr Erdogan will dominate Turkish politics throughout our forecast period through a mix of authoritarianism, control of state resources and bureaucracy, and a largely supportive domestic media. He is highly likely to remain in power beyond 2028, despite currently being barred by the constitution from serving another term.
The risk of social unrest has fallen significantly since the May 2023 elections, although a high degree of polarisation and still-elevated inflation will continue to fuel social discontent. In the event of serious unrest, it is uncertain whether Mr Erdogan would have the support of the security apparatus.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch Mr Erdogan won the 2023 presidential election with 52.2% of the vote. The election process appeared mostly free, but was largely unfair owing to strong media bias and restrictions on freedom of expression. Mr Erdogan's AKP-led alliance secured a parliamentary majority, but this was its worst performance since 2002.
On March 31st 2024 Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered substantial losses to the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) at local government elections. The AKP did not manage to win back Istanbul-Turkey's economic powerhouse and home to about a quarter of the electorate-and even lost some more provinces to the CHP (mainly western provinces). Economic issues prevailed over identity concerns, and Turkey's high inflation was the main factor behind the result, with many abstentions, notably among pensioners (turnout was below 80%), and protest votes in favour of the far-right New Welfare Party (YRP). At the same time as the AKP's candidates and campaign failed to muster support, the CHP focused consistently on economic grievances, including those of pensioners, successfully appealing to voters beyond the party's traditional base. Although the result will revitalise the opposition, Mr Erdogan's power will remain largely unchecked.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Although Turkey is a NATO member and a candidate for EU accession, it will maintain an independent foreign policy that is likely to be transactional rather than strategic, and will often clash with the other members. Negotiations over EU accession are currently frozen, and Mr Erdogan will not make any efforts to satisfy the rule-of-law criteria. Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in this sphere. Foreign policy will also remain unpredictable to a degree, which will weigh on investor interest in Turkey.
We do not expect relations between Turkey and its traditional Western allies, the EU and the US, and NATO to collapse. Turkey needs the EU and the US on its side if it wants to attract global financial inflows and support for its economy. The EU and the US are likely to refrain from sanctioning Turkey harshly, as Turkey is a critical security partner for the US in the region and a NATO ally, and is also a vital partner for the EU in managing migration, and many countries have important commercial interests there. However, there are a large number of irritants. Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400 defence system in 2019 had already put severe strain on Turkish-US relations, leading to the introduction of mild US sanctions at end-2020. The West also fears that Turkey is helping Russia to bypass sanctions, and Turkey's continued pressure on NATO members to change their policies on Kurdish activism has created frictions. The main issues in Turkish-EU relations are human rights, Cyprus and territorial rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey's dire need for trade, tourism and financial investment has pushed Mr Erdogan to deepen ties with non-traditional partners, particularly in the Middle East.
Relations between Greece and Turkey have improved. In 2021, after the de-escalation of tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, Greece and Turkey put forward a new "positive agenda" intended to promote economic, trade and investment co-operation. Economic rapprochement may reduce political tensions, but is unlikely to lead to breakthroughs on intractable political disputes in the short term-including tensions over the extent of their exclusive economic zones and hydrocarbons exploration, and an unresolved dispute over the division of Cyprus. With Cyprus focused on developing its hydrocarbons resources, and a solution to the unification problem unlikely, Turkey's activity in the island's exclusive economic zone will continue to put it at odds with Cyprus, Greece and other regional players.
Mr Erdogan will continue to extend the country's influence in Central Asia and the South Caucasus-albeit without provoking Russia, with which it has developed closer economic and energy ties since 2016 despite some recent divergences around the Black Sea. From Turkey's perspective, forging closer ties with Russia, especially over energy imports and tourism, makes economic sense.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends The focus over the rest of 2024 will remain on the dismantling of the unorthodox economic programme that started in 2021. The new programme, which includes tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms, will reassure investors. These policies are designed to reduce inflation and improve external balances. The new economic programme also promises a floating currency and an inflation-targeting strategy.
Rebalancing the economy will be a gradual process, in order to prevent potential financial sector problems stemming from high corporate and household debt levels. In several respects, the policy framework still does not mark a full return to economic orthodoxy. Some of the existing unorthodox banking regulations will remain alongside the CBT's policy rate to control domestic demand. The re-establishment of the one-week repurchase rate as the main monetary policy instrument is not yet complete. Meanwhile, exchange-rate policy is non-transparent. The use of special savings accounts that protect against lira depreciation (known as KKMs) is now being discouraged and will be phased out gradually. Overall, we expect the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the central bank will continue to face political pressure for looser policies and consider other goals besides price stability.
We maintain our view that the current orthodox economic programme will be implemented at least until 2025. No major elections are due before 2028, and there is ample time for the AKP to reorganise itself after its defeat at the local elections. Furthermore, Mr Erdogan has expressed a commitment to the existing government programme and to fighting inflation. However, we will keep monitoring signs of the programme being derailed, especially given Mr Erdogan's known preference for ultra-low interest rates, loose fiscal policies and the AKP's poor performance at the local elections. Past experience suggests that stringency policies, constraining consumption and economic growth, are unlikely to be politically sustainable, especially closer to elections. The risk of a return to looser policies will also increase if policymakers fail to impress potential foreign investors and financiers, endangering the net capital inflows that are needed to offset the current-account deficit and enable Turkey to keep servicing its private- and public-sector foreign debt (about 50% of GDP).
Uncertainty over Mr Erdogan's commitment to orthodox policies will continue to affect confidence, and the risk of a full-blown economic crisis would rise again if he reintroduced irrational economic policies. Meanwhile, the global outlook presents a downside risk, as it could hamper Turkey's ability to attract financial capital. Geopolitical conflicts and tensions are likely to affect the prospects for trade, finance and tourism. In the event of an economic crisis, capital and import controls could be imposed. Turkey's low public debt levels mean that the government would have room to provide assistance to banks or firms in such a scenario.
A balance-of-payments crisis will remain a risk over 2024-28. Turkey's high risk premium makes it hard for the country to attract sufficient capital inflows to offset its large current-account deficit and roll over its foreign debt. Capital inflows have been improving, and foreign-exchange reserves have picked up since June last year. Mr Erdogan has been able to shore up Turkey's foreign-exchange reserves through swap and deposit agreements negotiated with non-Western countries. These politically motivated capital inflows, as well as some savings from delayed payments and discounted prices for Russian natural gas, are likely to be extended and augmented; they are, however, unpredictable, and investor sentiment will remain fragile. With Turkey unwilling to borrow from multilateral institutions, it will remain highly dependent on these political allies to avoid a potential balance-of-payments crisis.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy Although the fiscal deficit will narrow from 5.3% of GDP in 2023 to 4.7% in 2024, it will remain large, partly owing to the many expansionary policies implemented ahead of the May 2023 and March 2024 elections. A slowing economy will temper the increase in tax revenue in the months ahead. The government will seek to compensate by rationalising tax incentives and combating evasion, but major tax increases are unlikely.
We expect the deficit to narrow to an annual average of 3.4% of GDP in 2025-27 as the government reverts to a more prudent approach to the public finances. The deficit will widen again in 2028, as it is an election year. Government debt is low (at about 30% of GDP in 2023), but two-thirds of this is denominated in foreign currency.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy At its May meeting the CBT maintained its main policy rate at 50%. It has raised rates by a cumulative 4,150 basis points since June 2023 (from 8.5%), following Mr Erdogan's re-election and the subsequent shift towards more orthodox policies. The real policy rate remains negative, but it is probably sufficient to cool the economy, check inflation and support the lira. Bank interest rates have also risen sharply, and domestic demand has already started to ease. We expect the CBT to start cutting rates in September and to continue reducing throughout 2025-28, in line with slowing inflation.
We expect the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the CBT's independence remains limited, and the risk of political pressure for looser policies will persist. The CBT will continue winding down its interventions in the foreign-exchange market, and unpicking the many regulations that it has imposed on banks to deter the use of foreign currency and control the level and direction of credit. It will also continue making quantitative tightening decisions and using some macroprudential measures to keep credit growth sufficiently low and deposit interest rates sufficiently high to reduce inflation. Overall, more orthodox monetary policies are still being implemented, but the policy framework still lacks rationality in many respects.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth We expect economic growth to slow from 4.5% in 2023 to 3% in 2024, but this will still be significantly above the OECD average. As part of a shift to a more orthodox footing, the government has started to increase taxes and interest rates, and is limiting access to credit, which will affect consumer spending and government expenditure. High inflation will also limit private consumption growth after credit-fuelled consumption in 2023. Fixed investment will continue to grow (although at a more modest pace), reflecting greater confidence in the direction of economic policy.
Economic growth will accelerate again in 2025, in line with falling rates and a recovering global outlook, and will average 3.6% in 2025-28, which is close to Turkey's medium-term potential. We expect a stronger acceleration in 2028, as it is an election year and we expect Mr Erdogan to resort to his old tactics of promoting faster economic activity for electoral advantage.
In the longer term, Turkey will remain a fast-growing economy given its geographical location, its sectoral diversity, its appeal as a tourist destination, its dynamic private sector and its rapidly rising population. However, several factors expose the economy to external shocks, including its reliance on short-term capital inflows to meet the large external financing requirement, dependence on imported oil and gas, and limited foreign-currency reserves. Furthermore, Turkey's longer-term competitiveness will remain open to question. Talk of structural reforms to improve the attractiveness of the business environment has yet to be put into practice, and the political, administrative and justice systems will remain weak.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation We expect inflation to average just under 56% in 2024-the highest rate in the OECD. Annual inflation stood at 69.8% at end-April, and we expect that it peaked at about 75% in May. Inflationary pressures have remained strong so far: the CBT has allowed the lira to weaken, and higher government spending and generous pre- and post-election increases in pay and pensions continue to support demand and increase costs for businesses. Meanwhile, although they have risen, interest rates are still below inflation, and we expect real rates to remain negative this year, which will prevent any significant slowdown in inflation. Between June-September we expect inflation to slow sharply owing to a base effect. Weaker domestic demand due to tighter monetary policy, a slightly firmer lira and falling inflationary expectations will also help to slow the trend in monthly inflation in the months ahead.
Further periodic bouts of lira weakness, persistent inflationary expectations, and high global prices for metals and critical minerals will keep inflation high, at an average of 18% per year in 2025-28. Overall, inflation will remain far above historical levels (of about 10%) and well above the central bank's target of 5% in 2024-28.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates The CBT has stepped back from currency intervention in order to bring the lira towards a more competitive level, and although the overall trend is a gradual depreciation, the central bank is trying to ensure that this is managed. As at May 27th the currency was trading at about TL32.2:US$1, unchanged from a month earlier and in line with an improvement in the current-account balance.
Overall, we forecast that the lira will depreciate from TL29.7:US$1 at end-2023 to about TL50:US$1 at end-2028. Internal and external imbalances, elevated inflation, and tighter monetary policy in the US and the euro area will weigh on the lira, which we expect to keep weakening against the US dollar in nominal terms in 2024-28. Poor international relations, foreign investor concerns about the politicisation of the central bank, and a reliance on short-term capital inflows will also weigh on the currency. The weak lira not only contributes to inflation but also adds to foreign-debt-servicing costs. Downside risks include a change in the administration's commitment to firm fiscal and incomes policies, as well as monetary policy. Global monetary policy may not ease as quickly as expected, which would, in turn, constrain inflows of financial capital. Higher than expected global oil prices could upset our forecasts for a dwindling current-account deficit and a slowdown in inflation.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector Policy tightening will help to reduce the current-account deficit from 4.1% of GDP in 2023 to 2.9% in 2024, partly as a result of lower domestic demand. Easing global commodity prices should also curb the rise in import costs. Meanwhile, a still-strong tourism sector and a recovery in external demand will support trade and services exports. After a gradual narrowing to 1.6% of GDP in 2027, the current-account deficit will widen again in 2028 ahead of the elections that year. Attracting sufficient capital inflows to cover the deficit and service foreign debt without drawdowns of foreign-exchange reserves will remain a challenge.

Full text: - The president, Javier Milei of the far-right La Libertad Avanza (LLA), has embarked on a sweeping programme of free-market reforms and front-loaded fiscal consolidation measures. Despite a severe recession and triple-digit inflation, the government remains popular as expectations of an improved economic outlook buoy governability. Nonetheless, the government has a weak legislative bench as LLA has less than a third of the seats in both the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the Senate (the upper house). As a result, the government is likely to face difficulty in passing its legislative agenda in the 2024-28 forecast period. Recent progress in moderating and diluting the scope of the government's reforms means that they are likely to get sufficient support in Congress to pass. Political stability risks are elevated, as highly mobilised unions and social movements vehemently oppose Mr Milei's free-market agenda.

- Argentina's position in EIU's business environment rankings has improved sharply for 2024-28. This reflects our assumption that the Milei administration will pass some market-friendly structural reforms that will benefit the investment climate, working in particular to ease the myriad of currency, capital and trade controls that have stifled investment. The government's commitment to fiscal consolidation and inflation reduction also bolster the outlook. Argentina's relations with the IMF will be positive as it meets its targets in its extended fund facility (EFF) programme, boosting policy credibility.

- Following a deep recession in 2024, Argentina's economy will grow by an annual average of 4.4% in 2025-28. The economy will benefit from some structural reforms introduced by the Milei administration that will boost investment, especially in agriculture, energy and mining. Disinflation will lead to increased private consumption amid higher real wages. Firm external demand for agricultural, mining and hydrocarbons exports will also be a major contributor to growth. Factors that will constrain growth include highly restrictive fiscal policy, price and currency controls (which will be pared back only gradually), and limited access to long-term finance.

- Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is likely to remain below the regional average. Moreover, an ageing population will place heavy demand on healthcare services, which require significant reform. Growth in the labour force will be quicker, however. A highly skilled workforce will help to offset the negative effects of slower population growth and will give Argentina a comparative advantage over other Latin American countries, although this will diminish as other countries make greater improvements.

- Argentina's wealth of natural resources, a large domestic market with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region, and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market all represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors. Improvements to the policy mix in 2024-28 will lead to greater access to the domestic market for foreign investors, increasing the scope for competition and the elimination of price controls. Although the economy will grow strongly for most of the forecast period, real wages will lag, with consumers remaining frugal in their spending habits.

- We forecast annual average GDP growth of 2.9% in the 2024-50 long-term outlook period. As growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in labour availability will also slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains and firm growth in the capital stock. Any gains in this regard are likely to come via technology transfer and higher foreign investment. Although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of political instability and authoritarian rule. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s triggered a period of growth, but an inflexible exchange rate and a failure to deepen structural reforms contributed to the downfall of the centre-left government amid a severe recession in 2001. An economic boom in the mid-2000s solidified the statist policies of the Peronist president, Néstor Kirchner (2003-07). He was succeeded by his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15); she was elected in 2007 and re-elected in 2011. Her time in office was characterised by low growth and high inflation. The next president, Mauricio Macri (2015-19) of the centre-right Juntos por el Cambio (JC), pursued orthodox economic policies, but these failed to revive the economy. In 2019 voters elected the Peronist president, Alberto Fernández (2019-23), to revive the economy using statist policies, but economic mismanagement led to triple-digit inflation. A far-right libertarian, Javier Milei of La Libertad Avanza (LLA), won the 2023 presidential election on a platform to pass radical free-market reforms.
Political structure: A presidential system is checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and a 72-member Senate (upper house), but the presidency dominates in practice. Argentina is a federal state with 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district. Each has its own government.
Policy issues: The Milei administration will prioritise undoing decades of interventionist policies that have caused significant macroeconomic imbalances. These market-friendly reforms include ending price controls, privatising state-owned firms, and ending costly and distortionary energy subsidies. The government is also planning to reduce Argentina's high tax burden, which surged to 29.1% of GDP in 2021, from 19.2% of GDP in 2000, according to the OECD. The government is also committed to lifting onerous currency controls that have been a significant barrier to foreign investment.
Taxation: The general value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, but VAT on certain goods and services is levied at either 10.5% or 27%. Personal income is taxed at progressive rates between 5% and 35%. Corporate income is also taxed on a progressive scale, ranging from 25% to 35%, depending on turnover. A personal assets tax is levied on the net worth of Argentinian individuals at a rate of between 0.5% and 1.75%; for firms, the tax is levied at 0.5% on the net equity value of stock owned.
Foreign trade: Argentina's average effective tariff rate was 6.5% in 2021, according to the World Bank. Amid a drought in 2023 goods export earnings fell by 25%, to US$66.8bn; the import bill fell by 8.4%, to US$69.8bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The president, Javier Milei of the far-right La Libertad Avanza (LLA), won a landslide victory in a second-round run-off election in November 2023; however, LLA performed poorly in the October congressional election, falling far short of a majority in both the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the Senate (the upper house). The largest party in both houses of Congress is the left-wing Peronist Unión por la Patria (UP), but by itself it still lacks the votes to block legislation unilaterally. Closely aligned with the UP is the far-left Frente de Izquierda y de Trabajadores-Unidad (FIT-U). Both UP and FIT-U vehemently oppose Mr Milei's free- market policies and they resist nearly all of his reforms. Owing to LLA's weak standing in Congress, the government relies on centrist parties' votes to pass legislation. These parties include the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), as well as the centrist Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) and Hacemos Coalición Federal (HCF). The government's relations with Argentina's governors are also important, especially in the Senate, as they hold sway with many senators. The next mid-term election is scheduled for November 2025, and the government hopes to increase LLA's seat share in Congress in order to improve governability and pass more ambitious free-market reforms.

Political outlook: Political stability Efforts by Mr Milei to implement his free-market reform agenda will dominate politics for most of EIU's 2024-28 forecast period. Although Mr Milei remains popular with voters, there are signs that his support may be weakening amid a deep recession and fiscal austerity. One sign was a nationwide protest on April 23rd against the government's cuts to university funding. This was the first major mobilisation against the government's policies, which has helped to embolden the opposition. The government has so far failed to pass any legislation in Congress. Mr Milei's hardline views and anti-establishment rhetoric, coupled with LLA's inexperienced congressional leadership, have made law-making difficult. The government's tensions with governors-fuelled by sharp cuts to fiscal transfers to the provinces and to public works projects-have also hindered legislative progress, as governors have significant influence over their representatives in Congress.
The government's need to gain the support of opposition parties is a result of LLA's meagre representation in Congress, with only 38 of the 257 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 7 out of the 72 seats in the Senate. LLA's congressional representation weakened further when the former party leader in the lower house, Oscar Zago, left the party, amid disagreements with other LLA members, alongside two other Congress members to form a new party-Movimiento de Integración y Desarrollo (MID). MID will probably support Mr Milei's agenda, but the defection highlights weak party discipline in LLA. If Mr Milei becomes unpopular, LLA may split further, worsening governability.
However, high confidence in government sustains governability for now. A March "confidence in government" survey by the Universidad Torcuarto di Tella (a local university) revealed a high score owing to a strong evaluation of the government's capacity to govern and its honesty. The public's view is likely the result of a disinflation process and the stability of the exchange rate, which is widely seen as an indicator of economic health. Higher than expected inflation or a devaluation could cause voters to lose confidence, posing risks to political stability. A major corruption scandal could also undermine trust in Mr Milei, who has railed against the so-called political caste.
The risk of politically destabilising social unrest will be high throughout Mr Milei's term, as powerful labour unions and left-leaning social movements are vehemently opposed to free-market reform. The government has taken a hardline stance against protests and has prioritised a more punitive law and order approach to social unrest and crime; however, this could lead to human rights abuses that could quickly undermine Mr Milei's popularity and shake investor confidence.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Argentina has been a democracy since 1983, following the end of a repressive military dictatorship (1976-83). However, the legacy of decades of authoritarian and populist rule has hindered the development of Argentina's democratic institutions, weakening the rule of law, which fosters an environment conducive to corruption. Another legacy is a disproportionately powerful executive branch compared with the legislative branch that often struggles to check presidents and their extraordinary decree powers. Although a powerful executive can make rapid progress on passing reforms, this also fuels political polarisation. The lack of transparency and scant effort to find consensus often leads to policy swings when new governments take office, generating policy uncertainties that repel investors.
A key characteristic of Argentinian politics is the swing between populists and pragmatists, with the pragmatists attempting to make up for the institutional erosion and economic mismanagement under the populists. Undoing the interventionist policies introduced by populist leaders is difficult, as they are designed to curry favour with powerful interest groups. This means that reforms to address institutional and structural weaknesses will be piecemeal at best.
Although governments have succeeded in making Argentina's judiciary (especially the Supreme Court) more effective and independent since the return to democracy, political interference and corruption are still major problems in the lower courts. According to the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2023, which measures a country's overall respect for the rule of law, Argentina ranks 63rd out of 143 countries in the world and 13th out of 32 countries in the Americas. Argentina scores poorly on the absence of corruption in the judiciary, as well as on regulatory enforcement and criminal justice, as reflected in low public trust in the judiciary. According to an April 2024 survey by Synopsis (a local pollster), 82% of respondents said that they had a bad or very bad evaluation of the judiciary. This is the highest level of disapproval of the key institutions in the country.
Weak rule of law enables corruption The weak rule of law enables corruption, which is a chronic problem in Argentina. According to Transparency International's 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Argentina ranks 98th out of 180 countries for its level of perceived corruption. This compares unfavourably with neighbouring countries with similar levels of socioeconomic development like Uruguay and Chile, which rank 16th and 29th respectively. However, the prosecution and conviction of high-level corruption cases has improved in recent years. Those who have received sentences include a former vice-president, Amado Boudou (2011-15), and a former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15). Ms Fernández is appealing the decision.
The absence of institutional reforms to improve the performance of the judiciary and tackle corruption weighs heavily on economic performance. In particular, Argentina's track record of expropriation and default poses significant risks to investors. A high level of corruption increases operational risk for firms, which also limits market opportunities. However, the Milei government has not made judicial reform a priority. As a result, we expect little progress to be made on this front over the forecast period.
The state's weak bureaucratic capacity is another obstacle to potential growth. State appointments often reflect political patronage, rather than merit. As a result, efforts to strengthen the bureaucracy will run aground owing to political resistance, especially from powerful public-sector unions. Moreover, the professionals tasked with designing and implementing policy are appointed on short-term contracts that are renewed with each change of government (or even minister), which curtails the formation and maintenance of institutional knowledge and memory.
Political outlook: Election watch The next major national vote will be the mid-term legislative election, which is scheduled for November 2025. About half of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and a third of the seats in the Senate will be up for grabs, and the result will depend on the state of the economy. The election is still a way off, but if Mr Milei succeeds in reducing inflation and stimulating economic growth, LLA may increase its share of the seats. In this scenario, we would expect Mr Milei to pursue structural reform aggressively after 2025.
If the economy fails to improve, there is a risk that the UP will make important gains in Congress and gain a majority in both houses. In this scenario, governability will weaken significantly. Depending on the state of the economy, there is also a risk that the opposition will seek Mr Milei's impeachment and ouster from power. The threshold to impeach a president requires two-thirds of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and poor performance is a valid reason to oust the president. We consider this an unlikely outcome, but it cannot be discounted owing to the high level of polarisation.
Political outlook: International relations The Milei administration is prioritising strengthening relations with the US, as that country has significant influence over the multilateral institutions (like the IMF) that provide Argentina much-needed external funding. In a bid to deepen ties, Argentina has applied to become a "global partner" of NATO, which will allow it to co-operate closely with the organisation on defence matters. The government has also committed itself to join the OECD after it rejected an invitation to join the BRICS group. Mr Milei's open support for the former US president, Donald Trump, is likely to complicate efforts at deepening bilateral relations with the incumbent president, Joe Biden. Relations with the US will improve if Mr Trump wins another term (not our baseline forecast).
Mr Milei will not seek to deepen ties with China owing to his opposition to that country's communist regime, but he will pursue a pragmatic relationship owing to Argentina's dependence on Chinese markets and finance. Relations with Brazil are poor, as Mr Milei is disdainful of the Brazilian left-wing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. We do not expect this personal antagonism to affect commercial ties, but there is a risk that disagreements on how to reform Mercosur, a five-member regional customs union, will weaken the Argentina-Brazil commercial relationship over the medium term.

Overview: Argentina's placement in the business environment rankings improves markedly in the 2024-28 forecast period, owing to the wide-ranging business-friendly policies proposed by the government of the president, Javier Milei of the far-right La Libertad Avanza (LLA). Nonetheless, Argentina will remain one of the more difficult countries in which to do business, and further improvements will require even deeper structural reforms.
Strengths: Mr Milei is working to reverse the statist economic policies that have plagued the economy and curbed investments over the past two decades through front-loaded fiscal consolidation and a dramatic bonfire of regulatory and structural reforms. Opinion polls show that the public supports these reforms. The government will protect private property rights firmly and reduce state interference in the economy.
Weaknesses: LLA has a minority position in Congress, which will limit the scope of the proposed structural reforms. The government will dilute its reform agenda, as it will have to negotiate with powerful governors, union leaders and members of the centrist opposition that do not share its radical free-market views. Argentina's history of political volatility will keep investors wary of a future shift in policy direction; they will probably take a cautious approach before investing.
What to watch
- The scope of Mr Milei's planned liberalising reforms will depend on economic stabilisation, which, if successful, will provide him with the political capital to push ahead with even more business-friendly reforms. In the meantime, the government's reform efforts will face many potential obstacles from the judiciary, labour unions and provincial governors. This means that the efforts could be less radical or effective than EIU currently anticipates.

Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Overall foreign direct investment (FDI) is below potential, owing to an adverse economic outlook, as well as high policy and political uncertainty; however, mining and hydrocarbons continue to attract significant inflows of FDI.
2026-28: Policy uncertainty abates and tax and regulatory reforms boost FDI; privatisations of state-owned firms encourage FDI.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Government lifts most, if not all, currency controls and eliminates most import taxes and export duties.
2026-28: Government reduces both tariff and non-tariff barriers. Talks with EU on free-trade agreement with Mercosur (Southern Cone customs union) continue, but EIU does not expect a deal to come into force before 2028.
Taxes 2024-25: Milei administration phases out distortionary foreign-exchange taxes and reverses income tax cut of 2023.
2026-28: Government introduces tax incentives to promote large investments, especially in mining and hydrocarbons sectors.
Financing 2024-25: A weak long-term deposit base restricts long-term credit for small and medium-sized firms.
2026-28: Bank lending to private sector grows as government reduces demand for domestic financing amid fiscal consolidation efforts.
The labour market 2024-25: High inflation causes tensions with unions; incidence of work stoppages and strikes rises.
2026-28: Government loosens labour laws to encourage more flexibility and formalisation; strikes are commonplace.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Infrastructure investment hit hard by fiscal consolidation efforts, as well as restricted access to financing that hinder public-private partnership (PPP) investments.
2026-28: Public infrastructure spending increases and reforms to PPP law encourage FDI, especially in renewable energy.
Technological readiness 2024-25: 5G rollout commences; government is likely to introduce tax incentives for tech start-ups.

Overview: Argentina's macroeconomic environment score improves in the forecast period, but this is from a low base; as a result, it will remain one of the poorest-performing countries globally and it will remain ahead of just Cuba and Venezuela at a regional level. The improvement is a result of the Milei administration's efforts to undo the ill-conceived interventionist policies that had built up under the previous administration of, Alberto Fernández (2019-23). The administration's front-loaded fiscal consolidation is reducing inflationary pressures by ending monetisation, as well as keeping public debt under control. The government's market-friendly reforms, aimed at improving the business environment, should engender greater investor confidence, leading to investment-led GDP growth over the medium term. Despite the expected improvements in policymaking, the macroeconomic category will remain the weakest aspect of Argentina's business environment.
Strengths: Mr Milei's "shock" fiscal consolidation aims to end Argentina's chronic fiscal deficits by delivering a fiscal balance through a rapid reduction in subsidies, public-sector employment, capital expenditure and discretionary transfers for the provinces. We believe that delivering an overall fiscal surplus is unsustainable, given political pressures from governors and opposition lawmakers to increase social and infrastructure spending, but we do expect the government to maintain a primary surplus over the forecast period. Fiscal consolidation will also reduce inflationary pressures as the government ends the use of money printing to finance spending.
Weaknesses: Inflation will not reach the single digits within our forecast period, as indexation in the economy is high and inflation expectations will fall only gradually. High inflation will also feed currency volatility, as it raises concerns about an overvalued exchange rate. We expect the government to allow the crawling-peg devaluation to broadly follow inflation and maintain the value of the peso.
What to watch
- Mr Milei's ambitious structural reform agenda could be subject to legislative setbacks, given LLA's meagre representation in both houses of Congress and the party's inexperienced congressional leadership. In February 2024 Mr Milei was forced to withdraw an omnibus reform bill amid questionable legislative support, which was a major setback. The government has put forward a smaller omnibus reform bill, which we believe will pass, albeit with further dilution. Similarly, Mr Milei's decree of necessity and urgency (DNU), which he issued in late December 2023, goes some way towards deregulating the economy and increasing competition. However, it has faced judicial obstacles, such as an injunction on its labour reforms.
- The external balance should remain a particular strength of the macroeconomic environment, on our expectation of a large trade surplus driven by agricultural and mining exports, as well as an energy surplus amid a rapid expansion of non-conventional hydrocarbons production. This will contain the current-account deficit. We expect it to be covered amply by foreign direct investment inflows and disbursements from the IMF over the forecast period.

Overview: Mr Milei's free-market reform agenda will go some way towards improving the operating environment for private business in 2024-28. His DNU contained liberalising measures such as the elimination of numerous laws and regulations that enabled the state to intervene in various areas of the economy, including industrial policy, state procurement and price controls. This marks a radical departure from Argentina's long history of state involvement in the economy, which increased significantly in the past two decades. The government's proposed omnibus reform bill also includes labour reforms to improve flexibility, as well as the privatisation of state-owned firms. These reforms have caused Argentina to enter the top half of the global rankings and to rise from eighth to second place in the region (behind Chile).
Strengths: The DNU lifted government price controls and limits-some of which had been in place since the 1990s-as part efforts to deregulate the economy. These included government mandates on supermarket prices, controls on the price of education and health services, rent controls, and various subsidies on electricity usage and public transport. The DNU also lifted procurement measures that forced the state to favour local suppliers over foreign ones. This will lead to a less distortionary operating environment for private enterprise in 2024-28 and will increase investment.
Weaknesses: Argentina's federal system gives provincial governors a large degree of power and the ability to disrupt the normal operations of business, as well as use their leverage with their representatives in Congress to hinder progress on the government's reform agenda. The governors' powers are particularly strong with regard extractive industries, which are largely under their domain. We expect tensions between Mr Milei and provincial governors to cause some disruptions to business-as demonstrated in February 2023, when the governor of Chubut province threatened to halt oil and gas production there.
What to watch
- Although the DNU clears the way for the privatisations of state-owned firms by changing them to public limited companies, vested interests could make these politically challenging, as could the fact that the public associates privatisations with corruption (on the basis of events in the 1990s) and with the 2001-02 economic crisis. State governors may also oppose privatisation efforts of firms located in their provinces, as these form important parts of local employment and patronage. The administration will sell Aerolíneas Argentinas (the national airline), Energía Argentina (a state-owned oil and gas company) and Correo Argentino (the national post office).

Overview: Argentina's score for policy towards foreign investment improves in 2024-28 owing to the Milei government's liberalising reforms, which include large-scale privatisation, tax cuts, granting equal access to public contracts, expanding private participation in infrastructure projects, lowering import tariffs, and encouraging foreign investment in critical sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, mining and hydrocarbons. These reforms caused a whopping 52-place rise in the global rankings, to 13th, and boosted Argentina to first place in the region.
Strengths: Assuming that Mr Milei's structural reform efforts are mostly successful, they should deliver a more stable and predictable economy in the long run and expand the market opportunities for foreign investors. A gradual lifting of currency controls will make the business environment more favourable to foreign investors, by allowing local subsidiaries to repatriate their profits, which is difficult currently. Lowering trade barriers will also firm up investment flows, as firms will be able to access necessary inputs, which will boost investment, especially in the mining and hydrocarbons sectors.
Weaknesses: Policy continuity is a key weakness in policy towards foreign investment, as there have been swings between populist and pragmatic governments over the past decade. The policy direction of any government that follows Mr Milei will remain a major risk, especially if his reform agenda loses favour with voters. Argentina has also had a sceptical view of foreign investment, and the risk of expropriation has been high historically, as private poverty rights were poorly enforced, but Mr Milei's firm views on protecting property rights and promoting the role of markets are likely to provide a political buffer for foreign investors.
What to watch
- The Milei government has proposed the Régimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones (RIGI), which would provide several tax and customs incentives for foreign investors undertaking new projects or expanding projects worth more than US$200m. To qualify, the project must be deemed to be of national interest and must target the agricultural, forestry, hydrocarbons, mining, infrastructure and technology sectors especially.
- Mr Milei will need to clear the eight pending cases against Argentina at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes that are related to the nationalisation of the private pension system in 2008 and several cancelled infrastructure projects. The government will face difficulty accessing the resources to pay US$16bn to claimants for the 2012 seizure of YPF (the state oil firm) and could struggle to pay other compensation, which will complicate the investment environment.

Overview: The operating environment for foreign trade will remain one of the weaker aspects of Argentina's business environment, with the country ranking near the bottom, both by global and regional comparison. The Milei government has taken steps to ease foreign-exchange controls, and its monetary policy has helped to reduce the monetary base. This has contributed to a narrower gap between the official and black-market exchange rates, making the complete lifting of currency controls more viable. Distortionary import and export taxes also weigh on the score. The economy is likely to remain protected in 2024-28, as the country is constrained by its membership in the relatively protectionist Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union that also includes Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay).
Strengths: The Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) is to issue a new bond (Bopreal) to settle delayed profit repatriation and foreign dividend payments (as it has already done with importers paying foreign suppliers). The settling of these outstanding debts is important for creating the conditions to lift currency controls, as it would mitigate demand for US dollars when the controls end.
Weaknesses: Argentina has free-trade agreements (FTAs) with relatively few countries, with all of its FTAs together accounting for only about 10% of global GDP (compared with 70-80% for Chile and Peru). Despite Mr Milei's promise of unilateral trade liberalisation, this is unlikely to occur, as opposition from powerful business lobbies in Argentina, as well as from neighbouring Brazil (the largest economy in Mercosur) is likely to be strong.
What to watch
- Although Mr Milei claimed in the presidential campaign that he wanted to dollarise the economy and promised to close the BCRA, we do not believe that these radical policies will materialise, owing to both the high economic costs and potential legal and political challenges. Instead, the government is likely to pursue policies that would allow for greater use of foreign currency in domestic transactions, especially for big-ticket items, as in Peru and Uruguay. This may help firms to mitigate exchange-rate risk when operating in Argentina.
- Hopes of an EU-Mercosur FTA are fizzling out, as the reality of limited implementation prospects has become clear. Although Mr Milei has declared himself in favour, the deal will be subject to significant headwinds, given a difficult political calculus among Mercosur (most recently in Bolivia, which was admitted in December 2023) and several EU member states. We currently expect the deal to be ratified, but not before the end of the forecast period.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Although the Milei government aims to reduce the tax burden in order to improve competitiveness, the need to restore fiscal balance and reduce macroeconomic imbalances will take precedence, which will keep the improvement in the score modest over the forecast period. As a result, Argentina's placement in the global rankings will not improve much, although it will climb four places in the regional ranking to fourth. The government will make efforts to simplify the tax code, but it will remain broadly complex and onerous, and there is a risk that distortionary taxes (including taxes on exports or foreign-exchange levies) will be phased out only gradually, as the government will need to maintain revenue sources.
Strengths: The government is currently pursuing fiscal reforms, which will raise income taxes and broaden the tax base. Those reforms are likely to help to ease the reliance on distortionary taxes, such as taxes on exports or foreign-exchange levies. Coupled with economic growth and spending restraint, we expect the government to achieve significant fiscal consolidation in the forecast period.
Weaknesses: Argentina's federal structure means that tax policy reforms are difficult, as different taxes accrue to the federal government or through automatic transfers to provincial governments. The taxes that are subject to automatic transfers include income taxes, as well as value-added tax (VAT). Cutting or repealing these taxes is difficult, as governors are unwilling to accept revenue losses.
What to watch
- The government has presented a fiscal reform in tandem with its revised omnibus bill. This bill would roll back an income tax cut that the previous government introduced before it left office in December 2023. The bill would also increase the minimum threshold to be subject to property taxes, introduce a tax moratorium that reduces the penalties for unpaid taxes and apply a tax amnesty for taxpayers to declare their undeclared assets to the tax authority in exchange for a forgiveness of penalties. We expect Congress to approve the bill by mid-2024.

Business environment outlook: Financing

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Argentina's position for financing strengthens from near the bottom of both our global and regional rankings to near the middle of the pack, as investor confidence will improve the country's access to international capital markets in the medium term. The improvement in Argentina's score reflects, in part, a reduction in the crowding-out of private-sector access to credit (as a result of the government's fiscal consolidation efforts), disinflation and stronger savings and credit growth (on the back of more orthodox monetary and economic policies), which will improve the profitability of the domestic banking sector. Nonetheless, Argentina's history of default and high inflation has reduced confidence in the domestic financial system. A lack of access to private capital markets after the country's default in 2020 makes Argentina reliant on the Fund, as well as China, for financing. The Milei administration's fiscal consolidation will bolster investor confidence, and we believe that Argentina will be able to access international capital markets starting in 2025.
Strengths: Banks have taken significant steps to increase buffers since the 2001-02 financial crisis, and banks' liquidity buffers are currently strong. Bank profitability has been robust amid a high interest-rate environment and high returns from investments in securities, especially claims on central bank notes and public debt. As a result, return on assets (ROA) came in at a firm 3.2% in September (up from 1.5% a year earlier) and return on equity (ROE) stood at 17.2% (from 8.9%).
Weaknesses: Decades of interventionist policies in the financial sector, high inflation, deep recessions and wide fiscal deficits have led to crowding-out by the public sector, leaving Argentina's financial system underdeveloped compared with those of its Latin American counterparts and with emerging markets more broadly. According to the BCRA, bank credit to the private sector accounted for only 7.3% of GDP as at 2023, which is well below the regional average of 45.7% of GDP.
What to watch
- With an estimated population of 45.8m in 2023, high per-head income compared with much of Latin America and a low ratio of private-sector credit to GDP, Argentina has-in theory-scope for substantial growth in its financial sector in the medium term. Whether this materialises will depend on the extent to which economic volatility eases and domestic confidence increases. There are signs that lower inflation and less demand for credit by the state is increasing the supply of private-sector credit, with banks offering mortgages for the first time since 2019.

Business environment outlook: The labour market

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: The labour market remains one of the weaker elements of Argentina's business environment, and despite a small improvement in the score, Argentina remains near the bottom in this category in both our global and regional rankings. Despite Argentina's well-educated workforce, the labour market score is bogged down by onerous labour regulations and an active and combative labour union movement. Mr Milei's DNU included several articles aimed at decreasing regulation in the labour market, but the lower courts ruled against it. In response, the government has included in its omnibus reform bill a watered-down version of the labour reforms in the DNU, which we expect will pass. More wide-ranging reforms to Argentina's labour code, such as reducing the power of the unions and undoing the rigid sector-level collective bargaining model are unlikely, owing to fervent opposition from the unions and many members of the left-wing and centrist opposition parties.
Strengths: Argentina's human capital advantage remains strong. Basic educational attainment is high; according to OECD data, school enrolment is at 100% among six to 14 year olds. English-language proficiency is the highest in Latin America, according to the 2023 EF English Proficiency Index. Argentina placed 28th out of 113 countries in that index, ahead of Italy, Spain and France.
Weaknesses: Argentinian labour unions are politically powerful, and about 70% of formal sector employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements negotiated by unions. Relations between the government and labour unions will remain tricky, and unions will be active in challenging government dilution of labour rights. However, some unions are more co-operative than others in terms of collective bargaining and working with business, such as the unions representing construction and retail workers (two of the largest unions in the country). Transport unions, for example the lorry drivers' union, tend to be more combative, and their strikes often have an important impact on business operations.
What to watch
- The proposed labour reforms in the omnibus reform bill include articles that are intended to ease the costs involved in hiring and firing, for example by extending the probation period for new workers from three to eight months, and allowing employers to sign collective contracts with unions that include new, less generous, compensation packages for workers in the event of dismissal. In addition, the range of sectors categorised as essential will expand, and up to three-quarters of employees will have to remain active during strikes, which will make unions much less able to protest effectively against government policies.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Argentina's infrastructure remains relatively well developed, especially in urban areas. The country places at number two (behind Chile) regionally; however, this reflects the relatively poor state of Latin America's infrastructure, and by global comparison Argentina's ranking falls by two places, despite an improvement in the underlying score. The Milei administration will reduce the role of the state in infrastructure development, weighing on infrastructure investment in 2024-28, but the score improves because of enhanced internet connectivity, especially with the rollout of 5G. The government has cut spending on public works drastically, and until the economy recovers and policy becomes more predictable, there is likely to be little investor interest in public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Strengths: Argentina's infrastructure benefits from a well-developed road and rail network, as well as an advanced telecoms network. The country also benefits from relatively low office rents. We expect the PPP framework to be improved in 2024-28 to allow for investment in road and port infrastructure.
Weaknesses: Physical infrastructure has suffered in recent years from a lack of investment, which is unlikely to improve in 2024-28, given the Milei government's freeze on public works spending. The Cámara Argentina de la Construcción (Camarco, the construction chamber) estimates that there were 3,500 paralysed projects as at end-January.
What to watch
- Although we expect that the private sector will play a bigger role in infrastructure projects, the government will continue to support projects that it considers strategic and that have external financing, especially those in the hydrocarbons sector. This will be the case with the Gasoducto Norte, a project to reverse the flow of gas in an existing pipeline, which the government has continued to push for completion. Another project that will get government support is the second phase of the Néstor Kirchner natural gas pipeline, which would allow for exports to Brazil.
- We expect the government to gradually cut electricity subsidies, which will make the sector more appealing to private investors. Subsidies have kept investments in the sector low, leaving it weak and subject to bottlenecks. As subsidies are lifted, private investments (with the support of the government) will strengthen the energy grid, promoting energy-intensive industries, such as mining.

Business environment outlook: Technological readiness

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 geographies. c  Out of 12 geographies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Technological readiness is one of the stronger aspects of Argentina's business environment, but despite an improvement in the underlying score, Argentina ranks in the same place at both a regional and global level as other countries improve. We expect the quality of the e-commerce environment to improve in 2024-28, but the overall weak macroeconomic environment and the government's fiscal consolidation measures will hinder increased spending on research and development (R&D) and the market will remain relatively undeveloped, despite the country's high number of researchers per head.
Strengths: Online retail was quicker to develop in Argentina than in many other countries in the region, supported by an early and rapid take-up of mobile broadband. Online and mobile banking are also popular and are used to conduct routine transactions, aided by well-developed mobile-banking services and a modern payments system that meets international standards. Argentina is also home to one of the world's largest e-commerce businesses, Mercado Libre.
Weaknesses: According to UNESCO, Argentina has the highest number of researchers per head (1,211 researchers per 1m population) in Latin America. However, an extremely poor policy mix has prevented this extensive research base from acting as an engine for innovation-led growth. Expenditure on R&D in Argentina amounts to 0.5% of GDP in 2020-less than the Latin American average (0.7% of GDP) and well below the OECD average (2.7% of GDP).
What to watch
- Argentina stands to benefit considerably from a successful rollout of 5G technology. In October 2023 the Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (the telecoms regulator) finally held a long-delayed tender of 5G frequencies, with Telecom Argentina, Claro (owned by Mexico's América Móvil) and Movistar (owned by Spain's Telefónica) acquiring spectrum in the 3.3-3.6-GHz band. Still, the weak economy is likely to slow the take-up of 5G services, at least in the early part of our forecast period.
- The Milei government is likely to boost the scope of e-government, viewing it as a means to reduce public-sector costs and red tape. In the UN's most recent E-Government Survey 2022, Argentina ranked 41st out of 193 countries for e-government development, down from 32nd position in 2020. The biennial study ranked Argentina 51st out of 193 countries for e-participation, measuring usage level, down from 29th spot in 2020.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Economic policy will be market-friendly under the president, Javier Milei, who aims to make speedy improvements to Argentina's poor business environment. The government is pursuing wide-ranging structural reforms, trade liberalisation and deregulation to reduce operational costs for firms and to increase competition. It is also seeking to reduce the tax burden over the medium term. In the short run the government's economic agenda rests on a 366-article decree of necessity and urgency (DNU), as well as an omnibus reform bill and a fiscal reform package.
Mr Milei's DNU has been in force since late December and has eliminated numerous laws and regulations that enabled the state to intervene in various areas of the economy, including industrial policy, state procurement and price controls. There have been some unfavourable judicial rulings made against the DNU, including stays on labour reforms and the elimination of rural land regulations. The DNU could be invalidated if both houses of Congress reject it, revoking the reforms. The Senate (the upper house) has voted to reject the DNU; the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) is yet to vote. EIU expects the DNU to pass in the lower house, as the government has more support there, sustaining the reforms.
The government's keynote omnibus reform bill has been diluted in scope; the original bill, which had more than 600 articles, was withdrawn by the government in February owing to unfavourable line-item votes in the lower house. After negotiations with the centrist opposition, the downsized bill has just over 200 articles. Important reforms include the privatisation of four state-owned enterprises, labour reforms to encourage formal employment and tax incentives for major investments that are over US$200m. We expect that the lower house will pass the bill. The upper house, where the left-wing opposition is stronger, is more hostile to free-market reform; we therefore expect that the bill will have to be diluted further to pass in that chamber.
The government will also seek congressional approval for its proposed fiscal reforms. The fiscal package includes the reversal of income tax cuts that the previous government had passed by lowering the income threshold. Other reforms include reducing property taxes by increasing the asset threshold needed to pay the tax and a moratorium on undeclared capital assets that will be subject to a progressive tax. As with the case of the omnibus reform bill, we expect that the bill will pass in the lower house, but it may face more resistance in the upper house.

Government debt 157.9 101.1 77.9 66.2 62.7 61.4
The government is pursuing front-loaded fiscal consolidation; it posted an overall fiscal surplus of Ps267bn (US$305m, or 0.4% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2024. The government's fiscal consolidation efforts are focused on reducing real spending by keeping nominal increases in spending below inflation (especially for pensions), ending discretionary transfers to provinces, cutting public works spending, slashing transport and energy subsidies, and implementing temporary tax increases. We believe that the government will post a primary fiscal surplus of 1.3% GDP, falling short of its goal of an overall fiscal balance in 2024. The government will not be able to satisfy this objective because, among others reasons, it will be under more political pressure to increase social and public works spending. In addition, indexation of spending will also weigh on fiscal accounts as disinflation takes hold.
Negotiations with opposition parties and governors to increase social and capital spending are likely to lead to a partial recovery in spending over the rest of the 2024-28 forecast period. However, we believe that the government will focus on using the improved fiscal indicators to lower taxes. We expect the government to remain committed to spending constraints, which will lead to a primary fiscal surplus in 2025-28. We forecast that an improved fiscal outturn and a faster increase in nominal GDP will cause the public debt/GDP ratio to decline to from 97.2% of GDP in 2024 to 60% of GDP in 2028.

Deposit rate (av) 95.0 72.7 32.5 25.0 17.0 10.7
The Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) cut the policy rate from 100% to 60% at end-April, with the annual effective rate at 82%. With the real interest rate deeply negative, the monetary authorities are shrinking the monetary base in real terms by incentivising investors to reduce their stock of peso-denominated liabilities on the BCRA's balance sheet in favour of Treasury notes and a new US dollar bond for importers. The lower policy rate also encourages banks to lend to the private sector, as these loans offer higher rates of return than public debt. The primary surplus also means that the central bank is no longer monetising the deficit. The dearth of pesos is easing depreciation pressures and will eventually allow for a gradual lifting of currency controls.
We expect that the BCRA will keep the interest rate negative in real terms in 2024 to shrink the monetary base further. With the monetary base normalising, real interest rates will turn positive from 2025, which will support the authorities' efforts to sustain disinflation. Mr Milei made the closure of the BCRA and the dollarisation a major plank of his proposed free-market reforms, but our forecasts do not incorporate these extreme changes.

Argentina's economy will contract deeply in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of Mr Milei's "shock therapy", but firm agricultural production and robust growth in mining and energy production will drive an economic rebound from the second quarter amid higher exports. Elevated inflation has caused real wages to sharply lose purchasing power and has weighed heavily on private consumption; however, as disinflation takes hold, real wages will rise again (albeit tepidly) from the second quarter. A contraction in government consumption and public investment on the back of aggressive fiscal cuts will weigh on demand throughout 2024. Weak domestic demand will lead to a contraction in industrial production. A high level of political and policy uncertainty will also hinder private-sector investment in the short term.
Assuming that the switch to orthodox policies-including the lifting of currency controls-proves successful, we believe that the economy will record strong, investment-led growth after 2025. Private consumption will also be a major driver of growth, as disinflation will boost real wages amid increased employment opportunities. Rapidly expanding mining and energy production will bolster net exports' contributions to GDP growth as well.
Our benign core forecast is that the government's reforms efforts will put Argentina on a path towards macroeconomic stability in the medium term; combined with more business-friendly policies, the stage will be set for growth to average 4.2% in 2026-28 (when the economy will recover from the 2023-24 recession). There are substantial risks to this forecast, given that political resistance and adverse judicial rulings have undermined similar efforts in the past. Social unrest could also weigh on business confidence and investment.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Agriculture is the most competitive sector of Argentina's economy, with its share of GDP averaging 9.3% in 2019-22. However, a severe drought during the 2022/23 harvest meant its share of GDP declined to 6.8% in 2023. A return to more normal weather conditions will cause agriculture's share of GDP to rise to 9% in 2024. These figures underestimate the sector's overall contribution to GDP, as they do not include agro-industrial production. A clearer gauge of the importance of the agricultural sector's size in the economy is the share of total exports constituted by raw and processed agricultural goods, which reached 57.2% in 2023 (down from 64% in 2022).
In the short term, the health of the sector depends on weather patterns, but over the medium to long term, the sector's growth depends more on policies that encourage investment. Two decades of interventionist policies-including onerous export taxes on soy exports and export quotas for meat-have constrained investment and production. For example, the volume of exports of processed agricultural products peaked in 2007, before the onset of the most interventionist policies pursued by a left-wing former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15). Another indication of how anti-business policies have hindered the agricultural sector's growth is Argentina's nearly stagnant soybean production. During the 2007/08 harvest Argentina produced 46m tonnes of soybean, whereas Brazil produced 60m tonnes during the same period. By the 2021/22 harvest (prior to the 2022/23 drought), Argentina produced 43m tonnes and Brazil produced 126m tonnes, according to data from the Bolsa de Cereales (Argentina's grain exchange) and the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (Brazil's national food supply agency).
Argentina's agricultural sector will benefit from free-market reforms The free-market policies pursued by Mr Milei will lead to a gradual lifting of the interventionist policies that have hampered growth in the agricultural sector. In the short term, the government will maintain export taxes in order to provide tax revenue to pursue fiscal consolidation, but it has already lifted export quotas. Over the medium term, the government will lift export taxes and eliminate currency controls, as well as reduce tariffs and licensing requirements for imports of inputs. The government will also encourage increased foreign investment in the sector. One measure to that end will be to eliminate the rural land code that limits the amount of arable land that foreigners can own (the government decreed that this law be eliminated, but a judicial ruling has halted the reform). We expect the government to pass these reforms, which will allow Argentina to remain one of the world's most competitive producers of wheat, soybean and corn. However, a lack of progress on free-trade agreements between Mercosur (a customs union that also includes Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) with the EU and other major economies will limit agricultural goods access to new markets.
Argentina's energy sector has huge potential, owing to vast oil and gas resources. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Argentina's non-conventional oil reserves are the fourth largest in the world and its non-conventional natural gas reserves are the second largest. Most of these reserves are located in the Vaca Muerta shale play, located in the province of Neuquén. Despite the unfavourable economic policies pursued by the government of the former president, Alberto Fernández (2019-23), such as limiting access to foreign exchange and imports, Argentina's energy sector still grew significantly. Total foreign direct investment in the sector reached US$20.9bn in the third quarter of 2023, a 12% increase year on year.
Oil and natural gas production is forecast to rise in 2024 Surging investment in Argentina's non-conventional oil and gas production is offsetting the declining production of conventional production. Overall oil production increased by 9.4% in 2023 from year-earlier levels, but this was caused by a 25.5% rise in shale oil production (conventional production declined by 2%). Overall natural gas production decreased by 0.8% in 2023 from year-earlier levels, but this was due to a sharp 8.5% decline in conventional production, which was partly offset by a 16% increase in non-conventional production. Oil and natural gas production are forecast to rise by 7% and 5% respectively in 2024, according to the Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario (an agricultural commodities exchange). These increases would bring oil and natural gas production to levels last seen in 2008 and 2004 respectively. According to Rystad Energy (a Norwegian energy consultancy), Vaca Muerta's oil production could reach 1m barrels/day by 2030, providing Argentina with a significant new source of export income.
The Néstor Kirchner Gas Pipeline will allow Argentina to export gas to Brazil Another factor that supports the development of Argentina's non-conventional oil and gas production is the completion of the first phase of the Néstor Kirchner Gas Pipeline in 2023, which links Vaca Muerta to Argentina's major urban centres. A planned second stage of the pipeline that is currently under development will allow Argentina to export gas to neighbouring countries, especially Brazil. The IMF estimates that the pipeline will save US$6.9bn in energy imports and that exports will reach US$1.9bn in 2024. Work is ongoing to reverse the flow of the existing northern natural gas pipeline to allow Argentina to export gas to Chile, Bolivia and Brazil. After 17 years the Oleoducto Trasandino (a trans-Andean pipeline) began exporting oil to Chile in 2023. The state-owned energy company, YPF, and the Malaysian state-owned energy company, Petronas, are also exploring the possibility of building a liquefied natural gas plant to export Vaca Muerta's natural gas. According to YPF, progress depends on whether the Milei administration's Régimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones (a proposed incentive scheme for large investments) passes.
The rapid rise in non-conventional oil and gas production and the expansion of the pipeline network will convert Argentina into a net energy exporter in 2024. Investor interest in Argentina's energy sector is likely to grow, owing to the business-friendly reforms pursued by the Milei administration, and because high energy prices amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and eastern Europe are making non-conventional extraction methods more profitable. In addition, Argentina's isolation from global hotspots will make it an attractive destination for foreign investors.
Argentina's mining sector is largely untapped and set for rapid growth Argentina's mining sector has been slow to develop, partly because international firms are put off by a patchwork of different provincial taxes and regulations. However, reforms at the provincial level have been transformational. The province of San Juan has the region's most attractive business environment, according to the Annual Survey of Mining Companies, 2022 compiled by the Fraser Institute (a Canadian think-tank). Santa Cruz performs better than mining powerhouses like Peru and Chile. The provinces in the lithium triangle (Catamarca, Jujuy and Salta) are near the bottom of the regional rankings, but Jujuy performs just as well as Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. Despite this, investment in exploration has risen sharply in recent years. According to Cámara de Empresarios Argentinos de Minería (Argentina's mining chamber), US$427m was invested in mining exploration in 2023, an increase of 8.9% from 2022 levels and near the peak of US$516m in 2012.
Nonetheless, the sector suffers from poor infrastructure and difficulties with acquiring qualified personnel. Environmental challenges include drought, which is worsened by climate change. Firms also face difficulty in accessing financing and securing capital imports amid a plethora of currency and trade controls; we expect that the Milei administration will lift these barriers to trade and capital flows, which will boost investment and production over the forecast period.

Monthly inflation will remain in double digits until April, owing to pass-through effects on prices from the maxi-devaluation of the peso late last year, and to rising utility prices as subsidies are withdrawn gradually. We expect monthly price rises to ease to single digits from May as a sharp recession limits firms' ability to raise prices. We expect that inflation will fall to 155.7% by end-2024, from 211.4% at end-2023. The government's commitment to fiscal rectitude, market-friendly structural reforms and higher investment will also boost productivity, leading to faster disinflation in the rest of the forecast period, with inflation falling to 12.7% by end-2028. Risks to this forecast are high, however, as it will take years of commitment to tighter fiscal and monetary policies to consolidate inflation and inflation expectations at lower levels.

Following the maxi-devaluation of the peso in mid-December, the BCRA introduced a crawling-peg regime, under which monthly depreciation is pegged at 2%. Although a high level of inflation has led to rapid appreciation of the peso in real, trade-weighted terms, the government is committed to maintain the rate of depreciation. It retains its stance because the gap between the official exchange rate and the black-market exchange rate (a measure of depreciation pressure) narrowed from a high of 49.6% on January 23rd to 18.9% as at April 25th.
We expect that the government will eventually revise the crawling peg to a higher monthly rate (our forecast is that it will reset the rate at 5% from August) to prevent the real exchange rate from becoming too overvalued. If the exchange-rate gap widens unexpectedly, the BCRA may speed up depreciation earlier and opt for a faster rate than we expect. We expect the rate of crawl to slow in 2025 as inflation eases and the authorities seek to maintain a competitive exchange rate. We expect the government to keep peso depreciation around the inflation rate over the rest of the forecast period so as to maintain the level of currency competitiveness (in real, trade-weighted terms) at near 2018-19 levels by 2027-28. We expect that the authorities will have phased out all currency controls by the end of the forecast period.

Although Argentina will post a current-account surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2024 on the back of a large trade surplus, poor access to external financing will remain a cause for concern. The trade surplus will stem from robust energy and mining exports as well as a recovery of agricultural exports following last year's devastating drought. Imports will be hampered by a recession. We expect that the current account will shift to a deficit for the remainder of the forecast period as currency controls are lifted, primary income debits grow and service imports (like outbound tourism) lead to a wider service deficit. The current-account deficit will be financed by significant foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in extractive industries, but political and policy uncertainty will keep FDI inflows below potential. Credits under Argentina's extended fund facility (EFF) with the Fund will be the main source of external financing support in 2024, assuming (as we do) that disbursements will continue. We believe that Argentina will gradually regain access to global capital markets from 2025. We expect foreign-exchange reserves to increase with import coverage rising to 6.6 months by 2028, from a trough of three months in 2023.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Argentina Stocks and flows The stock of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in Argentina stood at an estimated US$128.9bn (20.2% of GDP) in 2023, with total FDI inflows of US$22.9bn (3.6% of GDP) that year. According to the Banco Central de la República Argentina (the central bank), reinvested earnings or debt acquired from headquarters by local affiliates accounted for 93% of FDI inflows in the first three quarters of 2023 (latest data available), and the remaining 7% was either equity or dedicated to mergers and acquisitions. This reflects the impact of currency controls, which have made foreign investors wary of investing in Argentina because profit repatriation is difficult. The largest single component of inward FDI in 2023 was debt, which partly reflects the difficulty that local affiliates faced in accessing foreign exchange to pay for imports; indeed, US$8.3bn of the total FDI inflows in the first three quarters of 2023 were trade related.
Argentina's outward FDI stock is much smaller, amounting to US$48.3bn (7.6% of GDP) in 2023. This compares unfavourably with peer countries in the region, such as Chile, which has an outward FDI stock of US$160.3bn (47.8% of GDP), and Brazil, which has US$529bn (24.3% of GDP) in outward FDI. This partly reflects Argentina's much weaker financial system amid crowding-out by the public sector, which deprives Argentina-based private investors of the capital that they would need to expand overseas.
Origin and distribution US-based firms are the largest source of FDI in Argentina, accounting for 19% of the stock of inward FDI as at September 2023 (latest data available). Spain-based firms come in second place, accounting for 15% and the Netherlands in third place, with 12%. Argentina also hosts significant investments from neighbouring countries, with Brazil-based firms accounting for 7% of the total FDI stock and Uruguayan firms 4.6%. Chinese FDI is growing rapidly; the country was the fourth-largest source of FDI in the third quarter of 2023, with total investments reaching US$343m-a year-on-year increase of 178%. China is making significant investments in the mining sector, especially lithium, and there is room for growth in telecommunications, infrastructure, and energy; however, growing geopolitical tensions between the US and China may serve as a barrier to investment by Chinese firms in these sectors.
Manufacturing accounted for 37% of the total stock of inward FDI as at the third quarter of 2023, followed by mining and quarrying, with 23%. The importance of mining and quarrying has grown rapidly in recent years, with its stock increasing from 20.8% of the total stock at end-2017. The rapid growth of Argentina's critical-minerals sector, especially lithium, has driven this increase, as has non-conventional oil and gas production in Vaca Muerta in the province of Neuquén.
Determinants Wide-ranging privatisation in the 1990s led to significant investments in non-tradeable services, such as utilities. Some of the privatisations were rolled back in the 2000s, and interventionist policies have hindered foreign investment in these sectors further. However, the free-market reforms of the administration of the president, Javier Milei, may rekindle interest in the non-tradeable sector. Export-oriented investments are mainly tied to the automotive industry. Argentina's relatively skilled workforce and low dollar wages have attracted FDI in services such as information technology (IT). Argentina's vast reserves of oil and gas, as well as critical-mineral deposits, especially of lithium and, to a lesser degree, copper, have attracted significant investments and will continue to do so over the 2024-28 forecast period. Renewable energy and green hydrogen are also areas of potential growth.
Impact Foreign subsidiaries have had a positive influence on the Argentinian economy, but mainly in sectors where domestic firms are sufficiently adaptable. In other cases, local firms have suffered from increased competition from foreign firms and weak linkages to local suppliers. Foreign firms are playing an increasingly important role in Argentina's burgeoning oil and gas sector, as well as in mining, as local firms often lack the technical know-how and access to capital required to extract these resources. Foreign firms account for a large share of Argentina's exports.
Potential The major attractions for FDI include significant natural-resource endowments and, to a lesser extent, Argentina's potential as a manufacturing base to service Mercosur (a customs union that also includes Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The free-market policies adopted by the Milei administration will attract foreign investment as the government lifts currency controls, eliminates price controls and lowers taxes on firms that make major investments in the country.

An ageing population and unfunded pension liabilities pose fiscal risks More than other emerging markets, Argentina's demographic profile is transitioning quickly to resemble that of more advanced economies. Argentina's demographic dividend (when the growth of the labour force is faster than population growth) is narrowing quickly as the population ages. The population aged over 65 is rising and EIU expects it to constitute 12.9% of the total by 2028. This rate will be higher than in other major Latin American economies, such as Peru (9.7%), Mexico (10.1%) or Brazil (12.2%). As a result, we expect the old-age dependency ratio to reach 0.20 by 2028, from 0.18 in 2018. The ageing of the population and the rapid and unfunded expansion of pension coverage over the last two decades, poses a major fiscal challenge for future governments.
The ageing population is increasing pressure on the healthcare system The ageing population is also increasing pressure on the healthcare system; although coverage is universal, there are significant disparities in quality between the public and private system, as well as between the richer and poorer provinces. This helps to explain why life expectancy in Argentina (estimated at 78.5 years over the 2024-28 forecast period) is lower than in neighbouring Chile (81.8 years). It also explains why Argentina's rate of excess deaths during the covid-19 pandemic was 450 per 100,000 people, which is more than either Chile or Uruguay, with 337 and 235 respectively, according to estimates from The Economist.
Argentina is undergoing an accelerated decline in fertility Argentina's fertility rate is plummeting; it fell below replacement rate (2.1 births per woman) in 2018 and then reaching 1.9 births per woman in 2021. This rate is significantly lower than the 3.1 births per woman in 1960, according to World Bank data. As a result, the percentage of the population that is aged 14 or under is declining, and we expect it to fall to 20.9% by 2028, from 24.2% in 2018. Barring a significant increase in immigration, Argentina will lose its demographic dividend in the 2030s. As a result, economic growth will rely increasingly on raising both labour and total factor productivity, as well as 0n capital investments.
High poverty levels are another constraint on the wellbeing of Argentina's population. Decades of boom-bust cycles have pushed millions of Argentinians into poverty and relegated them to the informal sector. According to data from the national statistics agency, 41.7% of the population was living in poverty in the second half of 2023, with 11.9% in extreme poverty. Meanwhile, 58.4% of those aged 0-14 were either living in poverty or extreme poverty. Inadequate nutrition and housing, as well as a lack of access to basic services, hinder the development of millions of children. Poor living conditions for children will reduce the potential productivity of the labour force in the future and put long-term social and economic stability at risk.
Outward migration is weighing further on Argentina's growth potential. Many of these emigrants are educated middle-class young people who have moved to Spain, Italy and the US. Many benefit from dual Italian or Spanish citizenship through their ancestors. Argentinians have also been moving to neighbouring countries, especially Uruguay. Uruguayan authorities have relaxed residency requirements, which has proven attractive for high-income Argentinians, owing to its more stable economy and the added appeal of being culturally similar and geographically close to Argentina. More than 30,000 Argentinians applied for residency in Uruguay between 2019 and 2023, according to Uruguay's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We expect outflows of skilled workers to remain high over the forecast period.
Lower fertility rates will boost female labour force participation We expect Argentina's labour force participation to rise, owing to an expected increase in female participation. The proportion of women in the workforce has trended upwards consistently in recent decades, rising from 39.9% in 1991 to 42.7% in 2023. The decline in fertility rates is supporting the increased participation of women in the labour force, which will help to narrow the gender pay gap. According to the OECD, the gender pay gap was 6.3% as at 2021.
More than 90% of the population lives in urban centres-one of the world's highest ratios. Overall, population density is low, at 17 inhabitants per sq km (about half of the regional average), but this aggregate figure masks wide regional disparities: the capital has 15,038 inhabitants per sq km, whereas the southern province of Santa Cruz has a population density of 1.1 inhabitants per sq km. There are marked rural-urban disparities in most measures of social and economic development; per-head incomes and healthcare and education indicators are much better in the Buenos Aires (the capital) area than elsewhere.

Argentina had the 19th-largest domestic market in the world, measured by household consumption, and has the third largest in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico, in 2022. However, economic instability and a poor business environment have limited market opportunities. A severe recession and triple-digit inflation in 2023-24 will weigh heavily on real wages with per-head household consumption not surpassing 2022 levels until 2026. Nonetheless, EIU expects that GDP will grow firmly in 2025-28, expanding market opportunities as the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms pursued by the administration of the president, Javier Milei, leads to lower inflation and greater investor confidence, which will boost both private consumption and investment.
Argentina has the fourth-largest population in Latin America and urbanisation is high. Almost half of the population lives in the metropolitan area that includes the capital, Buenos Aires. Other cities with more than 1m people include Córdoba, Rosario and Mendoza. These cities have adequate road and airport infrastructure. Outside these urban areas, Argentina's road and rail infrastructure is in need of significant investment, in order to improve quality and reduce transport costs.
High and rising poverty rates will limit market opportunities Argentina's high and rising poverty levels greatly limit market opportunities. According to the national statistics institute (INDEC), the poverty rate rose to 41.7% in the second half of 2023, from a low of 25.7% in the second half of 2017. Although poverty rates will fall as disinflation takes hold and the economy begins to grow again in the second half of 2024, we expect that it will take many years for poverty to reach 2017 levels. When looking at other measures of poverty that have less stringent thresholds than those used by INDEC (such as the share of the population that earns less than US$6.85/day at 2017 exchange rates, in purchasing power parity terms), Argentina's poverty rate was 3% in 2022, which is below the Latin American average of 10%.
High labour informality and elevated levels of self-employment are drivers of these poor socioeconomic outcomes, as both offer lower incomes than the formal private sector. As at end-2023 the median monthly income of informal workers was only 43% of the income of formal sector workers. According to INDEC, 35.7% of workers were categorised as having informal occupations and 22.6% were self-employed as at end-2023. The share of informal and self-employed workers has risen over time, as low growth and rigid labour laws have stifled hiring in the private sector. The Milei administration's proposed labour reforms, which seek to encourage labour formalisation through more flexible hiring and firing policies, are likely to help to increase the share of formal labour contracts in the workforce.
Real wages will not reach 2015 levels over the forecast period The more recent rise in poverty is a result of the sharp decline in real wages following the devaluation of the peso in December 2023. We forecast that real wages will decline by 8.3% in 2023, but they will recover to 2022 levels by 2026. However, real wages in Argentina have been falling consistently since 2016, and we do not expect them to reach 2015 levels in the 2024-28 forecast period.

We expect the share of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco to fall Amid persistently high inflation and anaemic economic growth, consumers have adjusted their spending habits towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets. In the medium to long term, we expect the share of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco to fall, and spending on hotels and restaurants, healthcare, leisure and education to rise. Income redistribution, especially cash transfers, will also support disposable incomes. However, an underdeveloped financial market will preclude a more marked improvement. Argentina's ageing population also means that overall expenditure on healthcare will increase over the forecast period.

Historically Argentina has been susceptible to boom-bust cycles, reflecting a vulnerability to external conditions, a poor business environment, weak institutions and policy uncertainty related to swings between populism and pragmatism. In fact, the country has spent more than a third of its time since 1950 in recession. EIU's growth forecast for the 2024-50 long-term forecast period assumes that economic realities will force Argentina to adopt a more sustainable model of economic development that reduces fiscal and external imbalances. The administration of the president, Javier Milei, is pursuing a set of structural reforms, such as labour, trade and tax reforms that we believe will encourage investment-led economic growth in the long term, assuming that they are maintained.
Argentina's GDP per head remains one of the highest in the region Initial conditions: Argentina's large internal market (the fourth largest in the region) provides largely untapped market opportunities, owing to its economic instability. Argentina's GDP per head of US$13,966 in 2024, or US$25,570 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, remains one of the highest in the region, but a prolonged period of economic stagnation starting in 2012 has meant that living standards have fallen behind more stable economies in the region, such as Chile and Uruguay. Argentina's GDP per head in PPP terms is a third of the US figure, suggesting that income convergence to developed-country levels is still a long way away.
Argentina retains a skilled labour base and is able to carry out high-level research and development (R&D) activity at a low cost, but this advantage is weakening over time, owing to the outward migration of skilled labour amid worsening living standards. Argentina's proximity to the large Brazilian market and its favourable access to that market through the Mercosur customs union give its manufacturing, as well as its mining and hydrocarbons sector, significant potential to integrate into regional supply chains. This is especially true for rapidly growing industries that can benefit from Argentina's vast lithium and copper resources, such as the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) in Brazil (expected to start in 2026-28). Although Argentina is distant from developed-country markets, and high transport costs place an extra burden on exporters, it is still likely to attract manufacturing investment amid global efforts to nearshore supply chains. However, a relatively weak business environment and a lack of free-trade agreements compared with competitor nations in the rest of Latin American and Asia, will hinder growth. Argentina will retain its strong comparative advantage in agriculture, but climate change poses growing risks to the sector.
Pension reforms are likely to mitigate impact of ageing population Demographic trends: Argentina shares many demographic and cultural features with western Europe. The average age of the population is higher than in most of the rest of the region, and we expect population growth in both percentage and absolute terms to be slightly below the Latin American average. We expect population growth of 0.5% per year in 2024-50, which is less than half the growth rate over 1981-2023. At present the working-age population is growing faster than the overall population, but we expect this trend to reverse in 2035. As a result, the contribution of labour to GDP growth will weaken, particularly towards the end of the long-term forecast period. The population in Argentina will remain highly urbanised, and a high level of healthcare coverage will cause life expectancy to continue to improve over 2024-50. According to the latest UN population forecasts, the population aged 65 and over will rise to represent 19% of the total by 2050, from 12.1% in 2023. We believe that future governments will seek to increase the retirement age and encourage employment for people in that age bracket, in order to mitigate the economic, social and fiscal impacts of a rapidly ageing population. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are also likely to assist in improving the productivity of older workers.
External conditions: Growth-determining factors exogenous to Argentina will include the level of developed-country interest rates (in the past this has been strongly correlated with the volume of capital flows into Latin America), along with demand and prices for agricultural products and critical minerals. Argentina's geopolitical isolation from global hotspots, vast mineral and energy resources and its relatively highly skilled population will make it an attractive destination for foreign investment amid a push to nearshore production, and will increase the resilience of supply chains. Massive global investments in renewable energy, energy grids, EVs and AI data centres will boost demand for Argentina's lithium and copper, which will be a major driver of export-led growth over the long-term forecast period.
Policymaking will remain influenced by the governing style of the president Institutions and policy trends: Shortcomings in policymaking and weak institutions have led indirectly to disappointing economic outcomes. Argentina scores moderately to poorly on measures of corruption, security and the rule of law. Our analysis suggests that an improvement in the overall institutional climate would have a significant impact on long-term growth, but this is unlikely to materialise in the short term. Repeated exposure to political and economic crises has resulted in the delegation of sweeping powers to the executive branch. As a result, policymaking will remain strongly influenced by the personal governing style of whoever is president. Judicial mechanisms to check presidential overreach are in place but are typically perceived as slow, inefficient and prone to political pressures.
Long-term performance: We forecast that average annual GDP will grow by 2.9% in 2024-50. Our forecasts assume that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm throughout those years. We also assume that, as growth in the working-age population slows, growth will become more dependent on both labour and total factor productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign investment. Firms will look beyond national borders in order to achieve economies of scale, which will stimulate efficiency gains. Even though Argentina's abundant natural resources and firm skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to reach developed-market income levels. Nonetheless, we forecast that growth will be fast enough that GDP per head in PPP terms will lead to some meaningful convergence with US levels of income by 2050.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is a risk to Argentina's long-term growth, owing primarily to the risk of higher temperatures and drought in the agriculture sector in the Pampas region, but also mining operations in the Andean highlands. More severe droughts and high temperatures also increase the risk of megafires in the forested regions of the country, which pose a threat to both life and property. Public health is also at risk, as tropical diseases, such as dengue, will spread to temperate climates, affecting more of Argentina's population in the coming decades. The negative effects of climate change are already manifesting themselves in heat waves constraining hydroelectric power generation, lowering crop yields and affecting river levels. For example, the Paraná River, a major waterway for agricultural exports from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, reached its second-lowest recorded level in 2021, owing to a severe drought in Brazil and Paraguay.
Nonetheless, Argentina's varied climate and topography make it one of the best-placed countries globally to benefit from growing investments in renewable energy. Strong winds in the southern Patagonian region and a high level of solar radiation in the north-western Andean region are ideal for investment in renewables. According to Bloomberg NEF's Climatescope, Argentina ranked 55th in the world in terms of its attractiveness for investment in renewable energy in 2022. It scored well in terms of market fundamentals, which includes market structure and policies; however, it scored poorly on experience and opportunities. Many years of policy inaction has meant that Argentina compares unfavourably with Chile, which ranked 11th. In recent years a poor business environment meant that investment in renewables declined from a high of US$2.6bn in 2018 to US$706m in 2022. As a result, the share of renewable energy (wind and solar) in total installed capacity is below potential and has risen slowly from 0.4% in 2016 to 12.3% in 2022.
Investment in Argentina's renewables sector is likely to grow in the coming years as the administration of the president, Javier Milei, seeks to attract foreign investment in infrastructure, including energy generation. The Régimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones (a proposed incentive scheme for large investments) will create favourable conditions. However, we do not expect that Mr Milei will prioritise climate change policy, as he has doubts about climate change being caused by humans. Moreover, the government is likely to focus its efforts on maximising investments in Argentina's vast non-conventional oil and gas deposits in the Vaca Muerta shale play located in the province of Neuquén, which will hinder progress on the country's Paris Agreement climate commitments.
Technological developments Argentina's relatively low labour costs, firm skills base and decent standard of living, especially in Buenos Aires (the capital), are factors that support its ability to attract investment in services and information technology. These factors, as well as relatively easy residency requirements, are also attracting highly skilled digital nomads. As a result, Argentina has a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship. Argentina is home to some of Latin America's largest technology firms, such as Mercado Libre and Globant. However, economic volatility, high taxes, capital controls, byzantine regulations and policy uncertainty have hindered growth.
Argentina's traditional advantage of having a highly skilled labour force is gradually weakening. Low incomes and political instability have led to significant outflows of highly skilled workers, especially to Europe and the US. Education inequality limits the pool of available workers. According to the OECD's 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) testing, Argentina's scores for maths, reading and science are well below the OECD average.
A poor business environment has also led to a lack of sufficient investment to upgrade Argentina's internet infrastructure. According to Ookla's Speedtest Global Index, Argentina ranked 73rd for fixed broadband speed as at March 2024, which is similar to Bulgaria (ranked 72nd), but far below neighbouring Chile (ranked 4th) and Uruguay (37th). Argentina ranks even lower for mobile network speeds (96th), similar to Mexico and Jamaica (95th and 97th respectively).
The growing adoption of e-commerce is a bright spot in the sector. Argentinian consumers value this method, as it helps them to compare prices in a high-inflation environment. According to the Cámara Argentina de Comercio Electrónico (the e-commerce chamber), e-commerce sales grew by a whopping 175% in 2023 to reach US$7.8 (1.2% of GDP). The number of Argentinians who use e commerce increased by 6.4% to 23.2m, or 50.6% of the total population with 16% engaging with e-commerce on a daily basis.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Confrontational party politics will remain a feature in South Korea in EIU's forecast period (2024-28) owing to deepening political polarisation along urban-rural, gender and age demarcations. However, political gridlock is not a new feature in South Korean politics and we do not expect a major degradation in the quality of governance. The parliamentary election in April 2024 cemented the split between executive and legislative power as the main opposition, the liberal Minjoo Party, expanded its dominant parliamentary majority. This set the stage for a contentious legislative process and frequent policymaking deadlocks until at least 2027, when the next presidential election will take place. The conservative-led government under the president, Yoon Suk-yeol, will face strong opposition in parliament and by trade unions over its plans of tax cuts and labour market deregulations. Security risks emanating from North Korea will remain high as that country's strategic weapons development and hostility continue.

- South Korea's global standing in our business environment rankings improves in 2024-28, rising by nine positions to the 17th in the world. Its main strengths are technological readiness, foreign trade and exchange controls, and financing. The country's global lead in semiconductors, consumer electronics, petrochemicals and automotives will continue to underpin growth in its export-oriented economy. South Korea boasts strong infrastructure networks, a high degree of digitalisation and favourable government policy and tax incentives for high-technology manufacturing. However, manufacturers face growing global competition and supply-chain risks. The country's ageing population and rigid labour market also pose long-term challenges for business.

- The external sector will continue to drive economic growth in South Korea in 2024-28 by supporting employment and business investment. Despite a heavy reliance on semiconductor and other electronics exports, which are vulnerable to cyclical global demand, a comprehensive manufacturing complex spanning petrochemicals, machinery, automotives and batteries ensures persistent export performance. This will also underpin continued business investment in equipment and facilities upgrade and research and development (R&D). The government will focus on fiscal consolidation, but tax incentives for key industries will remain in place to encourage industrial innovation and exports.

Population growth   0.0 -0.1
Working-age population growth   -0.6 -1.1
Labour force growth   0.9 0.4

- Population decline will be a long-term issue as a result of a low fertility rate and demographic ageing. South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world, at 0.72 births per woman in 2023, and this will remain well below the replacement rate despite government efforts to improve women's career opportunities and childcare benefits. As more people retire, fewer young people take their place and immigration remains low, the labour force will continue to shrink, meaning that output growth will slow in the long term unless productivity accelerates from its current growth rate. The growing number of retirees will also increase expenditure on pension and social care, which will strain the public finances.

- Household consumption per head and disposable income will continue to grow in 2024-28. The local market will be highly receptive to new products and technological advances. Opportunities in the services and healthcare sectors will become lucrative as consumption patterns change with the rapid ageing of the population. However, barriers to entry raised by strong market control by the chaebol (family-run conglomerates) will limit opportunities for foreign investors.

- South Korea faces a number of challenges that will limit its long-term economic growth. The rapidly ageing population will dampen growth momentum and market opportunities in the long term and strain the public finances. South Korean exporters will face greater competition from other Asian countries (particularly China, as that country climbs up the value chain in high-technology sectors). However, South Korea will have an advantage over its competitors in its comprehensive industrial complex and R&D capacity. We expect that the country's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 will create new opportunities in clean energy, batteries, automotive and nuclear power.

a Actual. b EIU estimates.
Background: Korea was subjected to colonial rule by Japan from 1910 to 1945, and then to partition by the US and the Soviet Union in 1945. The subsequent war between the two Koreas in 1950-53 cost 4m lives, but neither side won. Summits between South Korea and North Korea were held in 2000 and 2007. Regular contact subsequently led to a cautious thaw in relations, despite the North's nuclear programme. A former president, Moon Jae-in, spearheaded international efforts to engage with the North, leading to three summits with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, in 2018. However, diplomatic and economic engagement stalled in 2019, as the North preferred direct (but, to date, fruitless) talks with the US.
Political structure: Following several decades of authoritarian rule, South Korea has been a democracy since the 1990s. A directly elected president, who serves a single five-year term, appoints the prime minister and cabinet. A unicameral National Assembly (parliament) is elected every four years. Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) succeeded Moon Jae-in, of the liberal Minjoo Party, as president in May 2022. However, Minjoo dominates the National Assembly, and expanded its majority in the 300-member parliament to 175 after the legislative election in April 2024.
Policy issues: Yoon Suk-yeol's government will focus on using deregulation and tax cuts to increase labour-market flexibility, reduce tax and regulatory burdens for businesses and the self-employed, and encourage investment and research and development in strategic industries. However, plans of tax reduction and deregulation are likely to be thwarted in parliament owing to the ruling party's significant numerical disadvantage. The authorities will also employ policy and tax incentives to facilitate investment in advanced technologies and digital infrastructure, with the aim of promoting competitiveness and independence in manufacturing. Reining in property price growth will be another priority for the government. EIU expects the authorities to increase the supply of affordable housing through public planning and to use tax incentives to increase private-sector housing development.
Taxation: Corporate income tax ranges from 10% to 24%. Companies are subject to a residency surtax applied at a rate of 10% of corporate tax liability. Personal income tax ranges from 8% to 42%. In addition, a residency surcharge of 10% of income-tax liability is applied. The rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 10%.
Foreign trade: Merchandise export revenue decreased to US$645bn in 2023, from US$694.3bn in 2022, while the value of goods imports dropped by 10.7% to US$611bn. The trade surplus widened to US$34bn. Semiconductors account for about 20% of total exports. Shipments of mid-to-high end memory chips will grow strongly in the forecast period owing to data centre expansion, development of artificial intelligence and a recovery in demand for consumer electronic devices.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Despite being elected as president in 2022, Yoon Suk-yeol, of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), does not enjoy a solid governing foundation. This is a result of deepening political tribalism in South Korea (he won the election by just 0.8%) and a parliament dominated by the liberal opposition Minjoo Party. The divide between South Korea's conservative and liberal camps spans social, economic and foreign policies, as well as the interpretation of the country's historical democratisation process. EIU expects Yoon Suk-yeol to maintain the full backing of the PPP during his single five-year presidential term, which ends in 2027. However, his administration will struggle to implement its domestic policy agenda of cutting taxes for businesses, deregulating the labour market and curbing trade unions' power. His drive to weaken union powers and his conservative views on gender inequality in society will also antagonise unions and social activists, maintaining a moderate risk of industrial actions and anti-government protests during his presidency. He will nevertheless enjoy greater policy freedom in foreign affairs, which will allow his administration to pursue a trade-oriented, moderately pro-US foreign policy.
Minjoo holds 175 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly (the unicameral parliament) following a landslide victory in the 2024 election; it will therefore wield considerable power in legislation and the selection of parliamentary committees during this forecast period. The PPP's minority status in parliament sets the stage for fierce confrontational party politics. The conservative-led government's agenda of deregulation and tax cuts for businesses and high-income earners will face strong opposition from Minjoo, which champions greater public regulation and intervention to increase income redistribution, job security and in-work benefits. When needed, Minjoo can seek co-operation and support of the left-leaning Rebuilding Korea Party, which debuted in the 2024 parliamentary election with 12 seats, to reach a two-third supermajority in order to overturn the president's power to veto legislations.
Deepening political polarisation means that neither main party can claim support across the political spectrum, although both retains a strong command of their core support both. The PPP traditionally enjoys greater support in regions outside the metropolitan areas and among elder voter groups. However, the rise of a younger generation of conservative politicians adept at modern, nimble communication channels such as various social media platforms has allowed the PPP to enlarge its support base among voters aged 20 to 30 years old, particularly male citizens with conservative social values. Meanwhile Minjoo remains a formidable political force, as it retains a solid parliamentary majority and its strong appeal to middle-age and young progressive voter groups and in the Seoul metropolitan area and south-western provinces remains intact.

Political outlook: Political stability South Korea's generally benign political outlook is underpinned by widespread respect for democratic institutions, a low risk of violent social unrest and business-friendly mainstream parties. However, the functioning of government suffers from partisan antagonism. Yoon Suk-yeol, representing the conservative People Power Party (PPP), was elected as president by a narrow margin in 2022, facing an opposition-dominated parliament. The legislative election in April 2024 further exacerbated the split of executive and legislative power, as it resulted in a much more dominant presence in the National Assembly (the unicameral parliament) for the opposition parties. Policymaking and state budgeting will be frequently frustrated, as the government will have to secure agreement with the main opposition, the Minjoo Party, to pass bills and budgets through parliament.
This situation will severely curb Yoon Suk-yeol's ability to embark on reforms or manage domestic affairs in the remainder of his presidential term, which ends in 2027. The government's plan to lower the corporate tax burden and deregulate the labour market will be stranded amid conflict with trade unions and fierce opposition in parliament. The administration's denial of systemic gender discrimination will split public opinion and stoke social tensions. The stances on various policy issues held by male and female Koreans will become increasingly polarised.
Acrimony between the two main political parties will jeopardise policy efficacy. Neither enjoys broad support across the political divide. Continued attacks aimed at inflicting reputational damage will erode public confidence in politicians and derail consensus-building efforts to address South Korea's social and economic problems. Scandals related to corruption and the abuse of power will risk undermining the authority of senior officials. The PPP has outlined only modest proposals to tackle rising economic inequality and collusion between government officials and the country's industrial conglomerates (chaebol), despite these being two issues of widespread public concern. This will dampen the party's efforts to broaden public support in the longer term.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness South Korea's democratic institutions are broadly strong and its electoral system clearly designed and widely respected. Its political system also benefits from well-established institutional checks and balances, a competent and efficient civil service and a high level of public trust in government. South Korea's politics has traditionally been characterised by fierce competition between the liberal and conservative camps. The two main political parties have divergent views on policy towards North Korea and the legacy of the country's military rule and democratisation in the 1980s. Years of confrontational party politics have taken a toll on South Korea's democracy. A polarised interpretation of politics has shrunk the space for consensus-building and compromise, often paralysing policymaking. Politicians focus their political energies on taking down their rivals rather than working to find accord and improve the lives of citizens. This pattern of confrontational politics has been detrimental to the political process of consensus-building and cross-party co-operation and caused an increasing portion of the population to grow disenchanted with democratic politics and to lose faith in public officials. The result is rising public support for strong leaders unencumbered by political constraints, but also a decline in trust in the competence and integrity of politicians.
Several aspects of South Korean politics militate against effective governance. The main problem is a culture of brinkmanship and confrontation, making compromise hard to reach. It also makes for a weak and fractious parliament. The National Assembly Advancement Act rescinded the speaker's authority to force the submission of a contentious bill to a vote. This act, originally designed to foster discussion and consensus-building in the legislature, has instead caused stand-offs between the government and the opposition over contentious bills and paralysis in parliament on several occasions. The prohibitive effect on policymaking of the highly contentious character of South Korean party politics is particularly severe when executive and legislative powers are in the hands of different political parties, as is the current situation.
Another factor is the current limit of a single five-year presidential term. This is a legacy of South Korea's transition to democracy in 1987, which sought to prevent any potential drift back to an authoritarian regime. This restriction, combined with the president's inability to dissolve parliament and call early elections, means that the power of the head of state-and, in particular, their influence over the legislature-is limited. This tends to diminish the president's influence in politics towards the end of their term as the legislature starts to position itself for the next leadership change.
Political outlook: Election watch The legislative election held in April 2024 deepened the divide between government and parliament, setting the stage for policymaking gridlock. Minjoo expanded its representation in the 300-member National Assembly to 175 seats, retaining the power to pass bills unilaterally and to control appointments to most parliamentary policy committees. By contrast, the PPP was reduced to 108 seats, representing the smallest parliamentary presence of the ruling party in South Korea's democratic history. Although Minjoo lacks the two-thirds majority that would enable it to negate the president's veto, it can seek co-operation from the new left-leaning Rebuilding Korea Party, which controls 12 seats, to strike down government-proposed bills.
However, the landslide result belies tight competition between the two main parties. In the 254 constituencies decided by first-past-the-post voting, Minjoo won around 50% of the total votes, against 45% for the PPP. Meanwhile, in the 46 seats decided by proportional voting, the PPP-affiliated party won 18 and Minjoo 14. These results show that popular support for the two parties is much closer than suggested by their parliamentary seat counts, and the country remains divided roughly evenly between the liberal and conservative camps.
This also indicates that the next presidential election, scheduled for 2027, will be an intense contest. Yoon Suk-yeol cannot stand again because of the single-term limit, leaving space for fierce competition to represent the conservatives. Meanwhile, despite leading Minjoo to a historic legislative election victory, Lee Jae-myung, its chairman and possible candidate for the next presidential election, remains a controversial figure, facing police investigation over alleged abuse of power and corruption.
Political outlook: International relations Inter-Korean relations will remain fraught in 2024-28, posing a persistent threat to South Korea's national security. The country will tilt further towards the US in the latter's strategic rivalry with China, but will avoid outright antagonism because of deep and complex economic ties with China and because of that country's strong influence on North Korea.
Yoon Suk-yeol's government will maintain a hardline approach towards North Korea by strengthening South Korea's defence capabilities and enhancing military and economic co-operation with the US. Although South Korea remains open to negotiations, we believe that North Korea's leadership deems the country to be non-essential in terms of any negotiations over sanctions relief; it will instead focus its efforts on the US.
There is strong public support for South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons or hosting US tactical nuclear weapons on its soil. We believe that neither of these options is viable, however, given the risk of upsetting China and/or escalating inter-Korean tensions.
Beyond broader defence co-operation, co-ordination with the US and its allies on semiconductors and clean-energy supply chains, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries, will deepen. South Korean businesses will ultimately be forced to align with US-led trade restrictions on targeted Chinese industries, particularly advanced chips, next-generation telecommunications technologies and rechargeable batteries. Firms will respond to these risks by lobbying the US administration to soften its measures and diversifying their supply chains and manufacturing presence in North America (partly to benefit from US subsidies) and South-east Asia.
South Korea will seek to strengthen co-operation with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Australia, as bilateral trade ties deepen in relation to energy and raw materials for electronics, batteries and green technology.
These moves will weigh on relations with China, particularly as trade and investment tensions rise. Production and supply-chain diversification will help South Korea to mitigate these anxieties. However, the government will also be wary of antagonising China, its largest trading partner, whose help is also needed to contain the military threat from North Korea. The government will facilitate efforts to resume and host the China-Japan-South Korea trilateral meeting in 2024, in order to strengthen regional stability and improve trade prospects.

Overview: South Korea will maintain a generally benign operational environment for private enterprises, buttressed by world-leading technological adoption, high-quality infrastructure and business and trade friendly government policies. EIU expects further improvements to take place in the forecast period (2024-28), which will push the country higher on the global and regional ranking tables. South Korea's performance improves across all categories under EIU's business environment assessment, with technological readiness marking the highest score as the country's distinct area of strength while significant improvements are observed in financing, macroeconomic environment and infrastructure.
Strengths: South Korea's strong position on the technology front will be sustained in the long term, supported by the presence of advanced digital infrastructure and a high level of readiness to adopt and applicate innovative technologies. A traditional focus on research and development (R&D) investment and proactive adoption of technical innovation and digital technology will continue to serve as a powerful driver behind further globalisation for South Korean firms, especially those investing heavily in North America and South-east Asian economies.
Weaknesses: Confrontational politics and structural issues in the labour market remain the two main constraints for South Korea. The executive and legislative power will remain split in most of the forecast period, with the opposition, the Minjoo Party, holding a dominant parliamentary majority that grants it the ability to block government proposed bills or legislate without seeking agreement across the aisle. Deepening political polarisation further widens policy positions held by main parties, making compromise more difficult. In the labour market, despite good availability of skilled workers, a shrinking working-age population and the relatively strong power enjoyed by active trade unions pose risks of high labour costs and coarse corporate-labour relations.
What to watch
- South Korea's ability to sustain its export-oriented economic model will be tested against a background of rising trade and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, as well as growing competition from China in industries such as memory chips and automotive, where South Korean companies have established themselves as global leaders. However, South Korean multinationals will use the opportunity of global supply chain restructuring to expand production and markets in North America, South-east Asia and the Middle East.
- Policymaking will be protracted and riddled with delays and setbacks owing to the scant interest in compromise and co-operation between the two main parties, which respectively controls the government and parliament. This means that the government's plan to lower corporate income tax and curb unions' power will be foiled. However, both parties recognise the importance of promoting industrial competitiveness through investment, digital and logistics infrastructure upgrading and the urgency to boost childbearing through state support. Therefore, policy breakthroughs will mostly likely happen in these areas.

Overview: South Korea's macroeconomic environment will continue to improve in 2024-28, as the country competes for the top spot in the region in this category. South Korea's large external sector is buttressed by a strong portfolio of well integrated export-oriented manufacturing industries, including its world-leading semiconductors, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and automotive sectors. These exporters will benefit from sustained growth in global trade (albeit slower than the pre-pandemic pace) as a result of growing consumer demand and technology progress creating new demand (for example, for high-end memory chips and batteries). Growth in the manufacturing sector will underpin employment and household income growth. With monetary easing starting from late 2024, these will support stable increases in private consumption and business investment. That said, South Korea's economy faces a combination of long-term challenges at home and abroad. Domestic economic challenges primarily come from the country's demographic reality of an ageing and declining population. The biggest external challenge is represented by the need to rebalance foreign trade away from a strong dependence on China and industrial competition from China.
Strengths: Private consumption accounts for about half of South Korea's GDP. This ratio has remained relatively stable, suggesting balanced economic growth based on steady growth in national income and capital spending. For 2024-28 this virtual cycle of consumer spending and corporate investment will continue to sustain positive economic growth. The wide-ranging industrial portfolio of South Korea's external sector will continue to buttress domestic economic growth.
Weaknesses: The highly leveraged private sector remains a cause for concern for the domestic economy. The ratio of household debt (comprising mortgage loans and credit card debt) to GDP will hover above 100% of GDP, making South Korea's household sector one of the most indebted in the world. Despite an anticipated turn to monetary easing by end-2024, household and corporate debt servicing burden will remain high in the forecast period, as borrowing costs are unlikely to return to the historical lows during the covid-19 pandemic.
What to watch
- Domestic demand conditions will remain robust during the forecast period, as income and job growth remains on track, together with sustained momentum for capital spending. The collective efforts of monetary authorities and financial regulators to keep a lid on household debt growth will be watched closely as to South Korea's ability to maintain financial stability.
- In the medium and longer term, the external sector's high degree of exposure to China will continue to require the delicate task of rebalancing trade and investment. South Korean companies' investment in China will be constrained by growing trade frictions between China and its major Western trade partners, rising production costs and a lack of tangible progress on preventing industrial espionage.

Overview: South Korea's policy towards private enterprise and competition is expected to improve modestly in 2024-28, with its regional rank held steady. The conservative-led government led by the president, Yoon Suk-yeol, intends to support growth and expansion of small and medium-sized enterprises with reforms aimed at increasing the flexibility of labour movement and contain disruptions caused by industrial actions. However, government intervention in the workings of the market economy is not always transparent, and is a feature of South Korea's top-down political governing system. For instance, the South Korean president's recent public criticism of South Korean banks' profit growth on high interest rates has led to a series of lending policy tweaks by leading banks. Similarly, inflation concerns raised by the government have translated into downward pricing signals on the supply side. This subtle dynamic between politics and business will continue to feature in South Korea's government policy towards private enterprise and competition.
Strengths: The rule of law is well established in South Korea. All government actions must take place in reference to established rules and regulations. This equally applies to the government's relations with the private sector. The government's engagement with the digital economy follows the same pattern, with regulators upgrading rules following an open and consultative process to regulate digital technology platforms more efficiently.
Weaknesses: The incumbent government, with Yoon Suk-yeol's term ending in 2027, is unlikely to introduce new measures to lower the barriers to entry for smaller businesses, domestic and foreign alike, to compete with the country's family-owned business conglomerates, which over decades of vertical integration and cultivation of supply networks have established strong defensive moat around their business operations.
What to watch
- The government will continue to strengthen industrial policy support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with policy funding and R&D assistance. Meanwhile, the country will ramp up its policy drive in the forecast period, through deregulation and innovation, to foster growth in the services sector, which is relatively underdeveloped because of the traditional domestic focus on export-oriented manufacturing.
- The government will continue to promote the "value up" initiative with the aim to make South Korean companies more attractive to domestic and foreign investors by eliminating the so-called "Korea discount" to corporate valuations attributable to the traditionally low rate of shareholder return among South Korean companies. The government will exert pressure on publicly traded companies to boost shareholder value by increasing dividend pay-outs and lifting share prices.

Overview: South Korea will maintain its high degree of openness to foreign investment. Successive governments have maintained an accommodative stance with only a few remnants of red tape remaining to restrict inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in a small number of industries protected for national security and stability reasons, such as telecommunications, transport, agriculture and utilities. South Korea's growing portfolio of bilateral and multilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) adds to confidence in South Korea's commitment to the promotion of inward FDI. Meanwhile, South Korean companies will accelerate their global expansion, led by a surge in chaebol (South Korean family-owned business conglomerates) exporters' deeper participation in the US-led supply-chain restructuring featuring manufacturing reshoring and friend-shoring.
Strengths: A robust institutional framework has existed for the promotion of inward FDI in South Korea, and it covers a wide range of policy instruments from tax incentives to cash subsidies. Furthermore, South Korea's successive governments have reiterated strong policy support for inward FDI. The current president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has stated a strong interest in working with foreign companies in areas of advanced manufacturing, technology and defence.
Weaknesses: Competition regulators will continue to seek rigorous application of stated fair-trade principles. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) and the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) will maintain their hard-line stance on enforcing competition law mandates, as demonstrated in a series of moves to levy stringent fines on US digital companies doing business in South Korea.
What to watch
- The government has faced a number of investor-state disputes, some of which still remain pending for final resolution at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. At least three of them involve US private equity and hedge fund investors over their investment exposure to South Korean companies. FDI-related investor-state disputes include Switzerland-based Schindler Holding's 2018 claim as the second-largest shareholder of Hyundai Elevator that the South Korean government failed to exercise financial oversight related to Hyundai Elevator's share capital increases.
- The government's industrial policy will continue to support the reshoring of manufacturing and R&D by South Korean companies, with the aim of localising strategic components of the supply chain in the forecast period. In response to the government's call, Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, South Korea's two biggest exporter-manufacturers, pledged massive capital spending projects at home; their smaller peers will follow in the forecast period.

Overview: South Korea's strong portfolio of FTAs and its continuing pursuit of trade liberalisation mean that tariff and non-tariff protection of domestic industries and markets will remain minimal. Digitalised export and import procedures and customs clearances make the country's trade infrastructure one of the most efficient and transparent in the world. Decades of liberalisation implemented by successive governments have made regulations on capital- and current-account transactions more efficient and less onerous, compared with other countries. Robust trade and current-account surpluses, as well as large foreign-exchange reserves, give the government little reason to tighten foreign trade and exchange controls in normal economic times.
Strengths: South Korea is one of the world's top-ten trading countries, and the country's export performance is a bellwether for the health of global trade, with its export industries competing in important manufacturing areas. Accordingly, the government's economic policy and industrial policy priorities converge on the need to promote export growth. The imposition of controls on exports or imports is rare in South Korea and, if ever put in place, such controls are typically limited in scope.
Weaknesses: South Korea maintains a stringent stance on agricultural trade, given its high dependence on imports in the farm sector. Regulatory barriers are high for the import of food and agricultural products. Furthermore, protectionist schemes remain in place for certain grain sectors, making agricultural trade a sensitive issue with conflicting priorities between local farmers' interests and the government's free-trade policy principles.
What to watch
- South Korea's participation in the US-led global supply chain realignment will deepen in the forecast period with longer-term repercussions on its trade with China, its biggest trading partner. South Korea plays an important role in the US-led initiative to restructure the global semiconductor supply chain aimed at reducing the industry's reliance on China. However, this will increasingly become a thorn in South Korea-China relations.
- The government's efforts to liberalise the foreign exchange regime will culminate in the proposed repeal of the Foreign-Exchange Transactions Act, which has served as a legislative stronghold of legacy foreign-exchange controls since 1999. Measures to align the operating hours of the local currency market with global markets will precede the final step towards a fully liberalised foreign-exchange regime in South Korea.

Overview: South Korea's business tax environment will become more competitive in 2024-28. The current top business tax rate of 24% is already favourable by OECD standards. Moreover, the top rate mainly targets the chaebol, and the vast majority of businesses are eligible for lower tax rates and generous deductions provided by annually updated tax laws. The current conservative government led by the president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has pledged to lower the top tax rate to 22%, the same rate that prevailed until the 2017 tax year before the previous left-leaning government came in with a chaebol tax increase. The proposed tax cut will not materialise, however, at least until the next presidential election due in 2027, because the National Assembly (parliament) is currently dominated by the pro-labour opposition Minjoo Party.
Strengths: South Korea will continue to bring its preferential tax treatment of foreign investors in line with international standards. Foreign investment zones, free economic zones and free-trade zones, which have existed as preferential tax vehicles for inbound FDI, will remain in place, with local tax and customs tax waivers and discounts still on offer for foreign companies locating operations ineligible areas. Tax incentives in the form of deductibles are also likely to be introduced to encourage business investment in key industries.
Weaknesses: South Korean inheritance tax is levied at 50%, the second highest among the OECD members after Japan's 55%. This reflects a traditional political bias towards the goal of reining in the economic power of the chaebol. This inheritance tax rate can rise up to 60%, more than double the OECD average, if an extra tax levied as a management control premium for controlling shareholders is included. High inheritance tax creates various market distortions, such as business splits and stake divestitures, and adds to the opaqueness of top-level management at many foreign-invested companies.
What to watch
- South Korea's 2024 annual tax reforms have formally adopted global minimum tax rules prescribed by the OECD's Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Proposal to ensure that multinational entities (MNEs) pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15. The South Korean GloBE rules will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1st 2024. However, the Undertaxed Profits Rule (an extraterritorial enforcement mechanism designed to augment tax assessments on a business if that business is part of a larger company that pays less than the proposed global minimum tax of 15%) has had its effective date delayed until January 1st 2025.

Overview: Financial services in South Korea are efficient and sophisticated, with innovation driven by a steady stream of deregulation and growing digital technology. The roll-out of fintech will continue to accelerate in the forecast period, with policy support promoting further progress in this area. The policy initiative to remove compartmental barriers between different segments of financial services in the fintech space and to facilitate the insertion of technology into corporate and consumer financing will continue to reshape financial services.
Strengths: The digitalisation of financial business models is well in progress, with financial institutions rapidly digitalising their operating platforms. The legal and regulatory framework is supportive of the development and adoption of fintech innovations across financial services. However, foreign participation in this industry transition will remain relatively limited.
Weaknesses: Regulation of fintech is still in early stages, and the line between market discipline and government interference can be blurred by populist tendencies of policymakers, as made evident in recent financial mediation cases involving fraudulent or simply poorly managed investment funds. The Financial Supervisory Service, the financial regulator, has ordered South Korean financial institutions that sold retail investors on such problem funds to pay compensation to account holders. This pattern of dispute mediation superseding investor liability will not disappear soon, raising litigation risks for investors similar innovative financing products.
What to watch
- South Korea's open banking platform, in place since 2015, will grow into an all-in-one digital financial services platform driven by a seamless flow of data between financial institutions and fintech operators. The current stage of open banking platform development involves the addition of data and payment functionalities to allow consumers to buy banking products, insurance and investments and to move money across linked accounts via a smartphone app.
- Calls for increased competition in the banking sector, which is dominated by a handful of large private commercial banks, will receive greater political attention. The government will introduce a series of measures to stimulate competition in the banking sector, especially retail banking, by lowering the entry barriers and allowing new entrants to bring innovation with a view to lowering the cost of capital for consumers and businesses alike.

Overview: South Korea's labour market boasts of an adequate supply of skilled workers, although concerns about excessive labour protection, powerful union influence and a shrinking working population will linger. Difficulties for businesses to terminate workers for normal workforce adjustment reasons will continue to frustrate large and small domestic and foreign companies. The prospect of any pro-business labour reforms passing through parliament will remain slim until at least the 2028 parliamentary election, given the strong majority held by the left-leaning, pro-labour opposition.
Strengths: A highly educated workforce is readily available, with about 70% of young career starters having finished college-level education, far higher than the OECD average of 45%. On the flip side, the employment rate of graduates of higher education is considerably lower than the OECD average, indicating the relative scarcity of highly-paid job offerings from chaebol companies, financial institutions and state enterprises.
Weaknesses: High labour costs will continue to undermine the competitiveness and attractiveness of the South Korean manufacturing sector. Wages at top-tier firms are already equal to or even higher than levels found in other high-income countries. Wages at foreign-invested companies will continue to trail behind those at large South Korean companies, including the chaebol and state enterprises. Wage pressure on lower-tier firms and small-business operators will also rise amid growing demands for pay equality.
What to watch
- The legal mandate for employers to keep willing workers on the payroll until the age of 60 has been in place since 2016, while the debate is ongoing on whether to lift the age threshold further, given a shrinking labour force in South Korea. An increasing number of companies will move to allow employees to work beyond the age of 60.

Overview: Policy is executed efficiently through a mix of fiscal expenditures, public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives. With water on three sides and North Korea on the other, the population's access to the rest of the world depends on air and sea transport. Mountains and forests cover about 64% of South Korea's land surface, leaving much of its 52m population crammed into urban spaces. Build-out in and around cities will remain the defining feature of South Korean infrastructure, with a focus on providing sufficient capacity for public transportation. Policymaking will seek to address the challenge of moving commuting workers to Seoul from areas surrounding the capital city.
Strengths: South Korea has two of the world's busiest container ports-Incheon and Busan. Both ports are ranked highly in the World Bank Group's Container Port Performance Index. Digital infrastructure is well-established to facilitate efficient trade clearances at these gateway ports.
Weaknesses: The political divide between the two main parties and regional rivalries can cause delays for big-ticket infrastructure projects, which is the case for the South-east Region Gateway Airport project. This project, aimed at adding a new gateway airport in the south-eastern part of the country, has been mired in political wrangling across five successive administrations.
What to watch
- High-speed railway and intercity and urban railway construction will accelerate in the forecast period towards the goal of handling greater passenger and freight load and alleviating road congestion.
- The 2019 energy master plan to increase renewable energy's share of power generation to 20% in 2030, from 7.8% in 2017, will continue to drive the energy mix changes. The build-out of nuclear energy and coal-fired power capacities will decline by 10.1% and 15% respectively between 2020 and 2034 under the government's updated electricity supply and demand plan.
- Balanced regional development will remain high on the government's infrastructure policy agenda, with a view to reducing the concentration of economic activity and population density in the capital. The relocation of government agencies and state enterprises to provincial cities has been in progress since the launch of Sejong City as a de facto administrative capital in the country's central region.

Overview: South Korea's score for technological readiness remains high, at 9.7 for 2024-28, putting the country in the first place globally and regionally. The country's well-functioning government-industry R&D investment continues to make progress in harnessing new and mature technologies in all aspects of government, commerce, culture and social services. The extensive prevalence of broadband and mobile technology makes South Korea's economy and society highly adaptable to the evolution of digital technologies. South Korea also has a strong technology manufacturing base, supported by some of the world's largest suppliers of semiconductors and consumer electronics. Conventional industries are participating in digital transformation, with the automotive industry competing on the leading edge of electrification and autonomous driving technology deployment. Large private carriers continually invest in new telecoms technologies, and digital companies (large and small) form a strong ecosystem of digital economy platforms.
Strengths: South Korea has a strong system of collaboration between government and industry to identify and invest in strategic technologies. Successive governments have maintained a policy focus on keeping South Korea's global lead in digital technology deployment. This collaborative push will accelerate South Korea's upgrade of its digital infrastructure from 5G to 6G.
Weaknesses: The introduction of new digital technologies into the South Korean market is subject to a set of stringent certification tests, which serve as significant technical barriers to technology trade. The country's technology certification system sets tough requirements for personal privacy and data security, making it difficult for foreign technology companies to introduce new products and services into South Korea. This is especially true for cloud computing and mobile internet services providers seeking access to public- and private-sector customers in the country.
What to watch
- Smart-home, smart-store, smart-factory, smart-city and smart-everything projects, promoted by a combination of government and industry R&D programmes, will increasingly bring new technological concepts into reality and change the way that consumers, businesses and government engage with technology in the forecast period. The insertion of artificial intelligence, robotics and other digital technology alternatives into real-life settings will accelerate with consistent policy support behind it.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The South Korean government has an agenda of deregulation and tax cuts to encourage private-sector investment and employment. It will seek to reduce the top rate of corporate tax from 24% to 22% (the average rate in OECD countries), while also introducing new tax deductibles for business investment. However, EIU does not expect these policies to materialise as a result of the opposition's increased domination of parliament following the April 2024 legislative election. That said, tax incentives will be provided for key industries such as microchips, batteries and artificial intelligence, with the aim of raising the competitiveness of advanced manufacturing.
South Korea's ageing population and low fertility rate (the lowest in the world in 2023, at 0.72) mean that labour shortages will be a persistent feature in the medium and long term, weighing on growth. This will force the government to increase expenditure on health and social care, including childcare. The government will also seek to attract foreign workers with special skills to supplement the local labour supply. However, growth in immigration will be slow because of persistent restrictions. Trade unions will strongly oppose efforts to give businesses greater flexibility to increase working hours and lay off staff. This will lay the ground for more confrontation with the conservative-led government, which is intent on weakening the unions' power and deregulating the labour market to reduce operational costs for businesses.
There is bipartisan support for the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050, although the government will support steady growth in the oil and petrochemical industries in the forecast period, to improve energy security and support exports. Offshore wind power will be the main focus of renewable-energy development. The administration led by the president, Yoon Suk-yeol, will embrace nuclear power as a clean alternative energy source and promote exports of nuclear technology.
Economic security will rise up the policy agenda. The government will bolster legal and policy support to protect major manufacturing and technology sectors from industrial espionage, intellectual property theft and aggressive talent poaching by foreign companies. This will introduce additional compliance costs for businesses with exposure to these sectors.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Government expenditure 29.0 29.5 29.2 28.9 28.5 28.1
Government revenue 27.5 28.1 28.0 28.2 28.1 27.8
Budget balance -1.5 -1.4 -1.2 -0.7 -0.4 -0.3
Government debt 58.3 58.4 58.3 57.7 56.5 55.2
The covid-19 pandemic triggered a break from the country's traditional conservative fiscal policy. Public finances will remain in deficit throughout 2024-28, but the shortfall will narrow consistently as a percentage of GDP. In addition to social security expenditure, which will demand steady increases owing to demographic ageing, public spending will prioritise incentivising infrastructure upgrade, as well as research-and-development investment in the advanced manufacturing and technology sectors.
Following the progress in fiscal consolidation in 2023, the government will aim to cement this by replacing large-scale expenditure programmes with targeted subsidies and tax incentives. The state budget for 2024 includes a 2.8% increase in fiscal expenditure to W656.9trn (US$495bn), representing the smallest increase since 2006. Targeted support for policy priorities remains. A supplementary budget providing cash handouts to alleviate cost-of-living pressure on households is forthcoming, but it will target low-to-middle income households to reduce the impact on the public finances. We forecast that the deficit will narrow marginally to 1.4% of GDP in 2024.
Beyond 2024, fiscal support for industrial development will focus on strategic sectors, emphasising the public sector's role in guiding and supporting development in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential for wide application across the whole economy. Subsidies to encourage childbearing and to support export companies in trade financing, supply-chain diversification and the procurement of fuel and critical resources will also feature in public expenditure. Growing pension and healthcare requirements, resulting from a shrinking working-age population, will exert lasting pressure on the public finances. Consequently, we forecast that the fiscal deficit will narrow slowly to 0.3% of GDP by 2028. Diminishing shortfalls on the fiscal account will help to bring down gradually the public debt as a share of GDP in the forecast period. At 57.3% of GDP on average in 2024-28, debt will remain low in comparison with the OECD average (which exceeded 100% of GDP in 2022), with repayment risks contained by the fact that debt is mainly held domestically.

Government bond yield (%) 3.6 3.3 2.9 2.7 2.7 2.7
We expect the Bank of Korea (BOK, South Korea's central bank) to keep its policy rate at 3.5% until October 2024. By then, subsiding domestic inflation and a shift to monetary easing in the US will allow the BOK to start cutting interest rates in small increments. The return of monetary easing in South Korea will reflect the BOK's concern about slowing economic growth and domestic debt serviceability. A high level of household debt makes South Korea's economy sensitive to interest-rate changes, especially as a large portion of mortgages (the main source of household debt) are subject to floating interest rates.
We expect the BOK to adopt a steady and incremental approach to monetary easing in 2024-26, involving a series of 25-basis-point rate cuts. The policy rate will fall subsequently to 2.5% by 2026 as the central bank shifts its focus to supporting economic growth, employment and export competitiveness. The BOK will keep the policy rate unchanged in 2026, amid stable economic growth and benign inflation.

We forecast that real GDP growth will accelerate to 2.7% in 2024, from 1.3% in 2023. South Korea's export-oriented economy will benefit from an improving external demand situation as the global consumer electronics cycle moves up, lifting shipments of memory chips, and businesses in Western markets shift to inventory restocking.
Despite remaining an important economic driver, private consumption will be constrained in 2024 by the lingering effects of firm inflation and high borrowing costs, before receiving a boost later in the year from improving labour market conditions and monetary easing. Meanwhile, gross fixed investment, particularly in machinery and facilities, will rebound in line with a brightening export outlook. However, property development growth will fizzle out in the latter half of the year, leaving construction investment in retreat. The shift to a more cautious fiscal approach will constrain government consumption and slow down infrastructure investment.
Economic growth will remain consistent in 2025-28 as increasing export demand and the central bank's easing of monetary policy facilitate employment growth and encourage business investment. Investment spending will accelerate, led by infrastructure construction and pro-growth policies in the semiconductor, battery, bio-health and artificial intelligence industries. However, government consumption in 2024-28 will be more muted in a historical context, as the conservative PPP reins in public spending to reduce the fiscal deficit.
South Korea will remain reliant on its export-led growth model, with particularly strong dependence on external demand for chips, consumer electronics and clean-energy cars. EVs and related products will provide fresh momentum for the domestic automotive and battery sectors, although activity will remain export-reliant, and Chinese rivals that often enjoy cost advantages will offer strong competition for global market share. Electronics exporters will focus on mid-to-high-end semiconductors, as market share for low-end electronic products drifts towards rival Chinese manufacturers. Growing international trade conflicts and China's increasing substitution of domestic products for imported goods also pose challenges to South Korean exporters.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends South Korea's agriculture sector is comparatively small, accounting for less than 2% of GDP. Despite the existence of many bilateral and regional free-trade agreements (FTAs), successive governments have sought to shield the sector from excessive foreign competition and to support domestic food production. This applies especially to the country's rice farmers. Changes in favour of stimulating greater competition among local producers-by, for instance, raising limits on rice imports-are likely to face continued fierce opposition. This was illustrated by the strong stance taken on agriculture by successive governments during the renegotiation of the bilateral FTA with the US. Although the revisions favour the US (and especially its automotive sector), South Korea did not make concessions with regard to the agriculture sector, and further opening of the sector was kept off the negotiating table.
Semiconductors will remain South Korea's mainstay export product The industrial sector will continue to drive growth momentum and remain the largest source of employment, owing largely to South Korea's comprehensive manufacturing complex. This sustains resilient global demand for South Korean manufactured goods, including semiconductors, electronics, automotive, petrochemicals, steel and emerging products such as electric vehicles, batteries and bio-health products. The rate of growth will remain exposed to ebbs and flows in global trade, as domestic manufacturing is dominated by export-oriented production. The country's mainstay semiconductor, computer and telecommunications device manufacturing industries stand to benefit in the medium term from a growing global trend of artificial intelligence development, industrial automation, cloud computing and mass data-storage building. South Korean manufacturers hold a strong position in the global markets for memory chips, mobile electronic devices and high-end panel screens. However, increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers, particularly in low-end and midrange mobile communication devices, semiconductors, panel screens, automotive and shipbuilding, will challenge South Korean companies' plans to raise global sales and expand their market shares.
The covid-19 pandemic highlighted the growing attractiveness of South Korea's bio-health products, along with its traditional strength in cosmetic products. Meanwhile, increasing global recognition and enthusiasm for South Korean music, films and fashion trends have underpinned strong growth in the country's entertainment industry. These emerging industries will provide a new source of growth in the forecast period. Meanwhile, the country's drive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and support from the government in terms of policy incentives, a favourable tax regime and increasing R&D investment will bolster the country's renewable energy, electric vehicle, battery and civilian nuclear energy industries.
The pressure to diversify production and supply chains from China amid intensifying trade conflict between the US and China and a US-led initiative to establish secure and resilient supply chains among ally countries present both risks and opportunities for South Korean companies. A further split between the world's two largest economies will disrupt the supply chains of South Korean corporates that operate and sell in both markets, while also intensifying operating risks, as companies try to comply with divergent regulatory environments and technology standards in the two countries. The ongoing shift of South Korean manufacturing capacity to overseas locations that are either cheaper or closer to final markets will also have an adverse effect on domestic industrial output.
Incentives will boost investment in the US, at the expense of domestic facilities For the semiconductor manufacturing sector, where South Korean giants such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix dominate the global memory chips market and compete with Taiwan's TSMC for the most cutting-edge processors, new investment in production facilities in China-currently an important production base-will be hamstrung by US trade and investment restrictions on China's semiconductor sector. Subsidies and favourable policy incentives provided by the federal and local governments in the US, to attract onshoring of semiconductor manufacturing, will entice South Korean businesses to raise investment in the US, at the expense of investing in domestic production facilities.
A similar scenario will be played out in the EV and battery industries. The US Inflation Reduction Act provides generous tax credits for the purchase of EVs that are manufactured (or have a predominant majority of components sourced) domestically or in countries that have free-trade deals with the US. This will encourage South Korean EV and battery makers to increase production capacity in North America, particularly the US and Mexico. Another similarity to the semiconductor sector is the increasing competition from Chinese battery manufacturers. Although South Korean companies enjoy a technological and manufacturing lead in better-performing nickel-cobalt-manganese batteries, their Chinese counterparts excel in the cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate versions that are more broadly used in lower-end EVs. The cheaper Chinese-made batteries are more suitable for the mass market, and their application is projected expand more quickly.
Services will remain central to economy as household income increases The services sector contributes the most to South Korea's economy, accounting for more than 60% of nominal GDP. The sector will retain its importance in the forecast period, as it continues to grow on the back of increasing household disposable income. Growth in the services sector in 2024-28 will also be bolstered by the rapid development of financial technology (fintech) and the increasing adoption of digital payment systems. Greater openness to foreign investment in the country's financial and services industries will also drive innovation and quality improvement in the sector. Meanwhile the global promotion of South Korean culture will continue to boost overseas sales of entertainment content and services.
The government's policy agenda continues to emphasise the role of the services sector in boosting the country's economic growth prospects. In particular, the government will continue to focus on the role of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in increasing competition in the sector. The sector currently caters primarily to the domestic economy. Although previous administrations have made some efforts to support export services in engineering and construction, the sector will remain domestically focused, as South Korea will struggle to compete with other Asian countries that provide cheaper alternatives. However, the growing global popularity of South Korean music, films, television series and other cultural products will make the entertainment industry a bright spot of growth in the services sector.
Post-pandemic policy support for travel and tourism will increase Inbound international travel to South Korea will return to pre-pandemic levels by end-2024. This will provide a boost to the tourism, transportation, retail, accommodation and local entertainment industries. We expect the govern-ment to increase policy support, including a relaxation of the tourism visa scheme to encourage inflows from China, which accounted for nearly half of inbound tourists to South Korea before the pandemic, and from South-east Asian countries.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 23.2 23.1 24.8 26.3 27.1 27.7
We forecast that average inflation will decelerate to 2.6% in 2024, from an estimated 3.6% in 2023. We expect consumer price inflation to approach 2% by the end of 2024, because of lukewarm consumer spending and a high comparison base. However, food and energy prices will not fall sharply this year. The former will be affected by production loss caused by adverse weather conditions, while oil prices will be sustained by heightened geopolitical tension, recovering global demand and production failing to catch up.
Inflation will remain moderate, averaging 1.9% in 2025-28, on steady wage growth that will sustain a stable rise in consumer spending. In the long term, however, inflation will be suppressed by demographic ageing and weakening consumer spending.

Purchasing power parity W:US$ (av) 796.2 786.3 777.2 771.8 767.8 762.9
The South Korean won:US dollar exchange rate will remain under depreciatory pressure until the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) switches to monetary easing, which we expect to happen in September at the earliest. The won will then embark on an appreciating trend against the US currency. This will be supported by a widening current-account surplus. The won will appreciate against the US dollar in 2024-25 as monetary policy easing proceeds more quickly in the US than in South Korea, creating a favourable interest-rate differential trend. We forecast the won to reach W1,325:US$1 by the end of 2024 (after a sharp depreciation in the first half of the year), compared with W1,289:US$1 a year earlier.
Intensifying geopolitical tension in North-east Asia, particularly relating to the Taiwan Strait and North Korea, will remain a depreciatory factor for the won. With an economy heavily reliant on trade with both China and the US, South Korea would experience severe disruption-leading to a collapse in investor sentiment-in the event of a regional military conflict (which is not our core forecast).

Merchandise exports will resume growth in 2024, upon a recovery in consumer and industrial demand in key trading partners. As global consumer demand for electronics climbs and a restocking cycle starts, growing orders of memory chips and communication devices will boost South Korea's outbound shipments. That said, components imports will increase in tandem with finished goods exports. Together with still-high prices for imported oil products, this will keep the import bill large. Services exports will continue to increase, owing to a notable rebound in tourism inflows. Growth will continue in the country's flourishing creative industries (including film, music and video games). We forecast that the current account will record a surplus equivalent to 2.5% of GDP in 2024.
By the end of 2024 tourism-related exports will have surpassed their pre-pandemic level. The primary income account will record surpluses in 2025-28, when the current-account surplus will average 2.6% of GDP.
South Korean manufacturers of semiconductors, vehicles and batteries will accelerate the relocation and diversification of production in 2024-28. This will be driven by cost considerations and by geopolitical pressure to strengthen supply-chain resilience and security. It will also reflect the aim of serving local customers in destination markets better, against the backdrop of increasing trade regionalisation.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in South Korea Stocks and flows In 2023 inward foreign direct investment (FDI) amounted to US$15.2bn, roughly equivalent to 1% of GDP, in balance-of-payments terms, down from a historical high of US$25bn recorded in 2022, based on data from the IMF. EIU expects that inward FDI will remain higher than the historical trend, as South Korea's strong export-driven growth, global lead in key technologies and growing openness to foreign investment in its services sector boosts its attractiveness to foreign multinationals as an investment destination. International investors will be particularly interested in the country's rapidly growing export-oriented bio-health, semiconductor, battery and electronics industries. The country's comparatively strong economic performance during the covid-19 pandemic, due largely to its comprehensive industrial sector (ranging from the traditional mainstays of petrochemicals and automotive to research-driven semiconductors and bio-health manufacturing), proved resilient against the disruption of demand from some sectors or overseas markets. The conclusion of a number of free-trade agreements (FTAs) in recent years, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership-a mega-regional trade deal between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand-and the anticipated application for membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), will support growth in FDI inflows in 2024-28.
Outward direct investment flows have consistently exceeded inflows by a wide margin in most years since 2006. The trend partly reflects rising factor costs in South Korea, which have encouraged firms to establish operations in locations that are both cheaper and closer to their target markets. The bulk of this investment has been in manufacturing capacity. China and North America (mainly the US) have been the favoured destinations for outward FDI from South Korea, but local companies are also ramping up capacities in countries such as Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and other members of ASEAN. Direct investment outflows will continue to increase in 2024-28. This will be facilitated by South Korea's active participation in US-led efforts to increase supply-chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific region. Investment in production facilities for semiconductors and batteries in the US and Mexico will lead to strong growth in the forecast period as South Korean manufacturers seek to benefit from subsidies and favourable tax and land policies provided by local governments. By contrast, new investment in China will be curbed by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainties over trade and investment restrictions. South Korean multinationals will also be interested in investing in raw materials and natural gas projects in Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as expanding their production bases in South-east Asian countries.
Origin and distribution The US, Japan and European countries (principally Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) have been the largest investors in South Korea since 1997. According to data for 2022 from the Bank of Korea (South Korea's central bank), 26.2% of inward FDI stock came from EU countries, 22.4% from Japan, and 13.6% from the US. The manufacturing sector received the biggest portion of this investment, attracting nearly half of the total. South Korea's FDI regime used to be designed to protect domestic companies from foreign competition. Although accession to the OECD in 1996 brought improvements, the restrictive nature of the system only really changed in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, when the government began to promote inward FDI to assist the country's economic recovery. Almost all industrial sectors of South Korea's economy are now open to FDI. Despite the officially favourable attitude of successive governments towards inward FDI, the environment for foreign investment remains difficult by the standards of competitor countries, largely owing to the continuing complexities of registration, notification, licensing and approval requirements. Other problems include "turf wars" between government ministries, which frequently delay approvals. We expect inward FDI from Japan and the US to increase as a share of total inflows in 2024-28, owing to warming bilateral relations.
Impact Relative to other OECD countries, inward investment flows as a share of GDP are low in South Korea. Consequently, their impact on gross fixed capital formation is also limited. FDI inflows as a share of gross fixed capital formation reached a peak of 6-7% in 1999-2000, soon after the Asian financial crisis. This figure currently sits at less than 3%, and we do not expect the ratio to increase much over the next five years.
Potential We forecast that inflows of FDI will average US$18.6bn per year in 2024-28, increasing from an average of US$16.1bn recorded in 2019-23, driving the total stock of FDI from an estimated US$284.1bn in 2023 to US$377.1bn in 2028. South Korea boasts a market of more than 51m increasingly wealthy people, one of the most advanced manufacturing bases in Asia and a government that is officially committed to encouraging FDI. Nonetheless, it is still likely to remain one of the more difficult Asian countries in which to invest. This will reflect several factors, including residual hostility on the part of the population towards foreign ownership of South Korean assets and a continued lack of corporate transparency.

South Korea's demographic profile is distinctive. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with more than 500 people per sq km on average. Density in urban areas is even greater, as 70% of the country's terrain is mountainous. More than half of the country's 52m people live in greater Seoul, which comprises the capital plus the surrounding Gyeonggi province and the port of Incheon. The area has become a megalopolis comparable to greater metropolitan Tokyo, the area that includes Japan's capital.
Demographic ageing will accelerate as the fertility rate remains low However, the population is ageing at the fastest rate among OECD member states. EIU expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over to rise from an estimated 18.4% of the total population in 2023 to 23.3% in 2028. Meanwhile he share of those aged 15-64 will fall from 70.4% to 66.9%. Much of this is attributable to rapid social change; a wider range of career options for women, a trend towards later marriage (exacerbated by higher youth unemployment) and the high cost of raising children have led to a drastic fall in the birth rate. South Korea's fertility rate declined to 0.72 births per woman in 2023, which was the lowest in the world. The total population will shrink in the forecast period.
These changes will have a deeply negative effect on the economy. The rise in the number of people aged 65 and over will burden the public finances with ballooning healthcare and social security costs. Meanwhile, a fall in the labour force will result in constrained output growth unless productivity improvements accelerate. We believe that some of the effects of social ageing will be mitigated by the rising use of technology; South Korea has already embraced robotics and other labour-enhancing technology. According to the OECD, the country has the highest robot intensity in manufacturing industry (the industrial stock of robots over manufacturing value added) in the world. This trend will expand across a range of sectors over the medium to long term.
Immigration policies will remain tight in 2024-28 Labour laws and restrictions on guest workers will remain stringent during the forecast period. The government faces popular concern about foreign workers taking job opportunities from the local population. We expect South Korea's strict migration policy to ease in 2024-28 in order to attract more foreign talents and skilled workers to alleviate shortages in certain parts of the local labour market. However, the pace will remain glacial and successive governments will remain cautious about the issue owing to concerns about potential public opposition. There has been a gradual shift to encourage migrant workers, mostly from Asian countries, to join sectors that face labour shortages. The government's low-skilled-work scheme is mainly designed to fill labour shortages in manufacturing, fishing and agriculture; however, living and working conditions for low-skilled migrants are reportedly very poor. Before the pandemic, this programme accepted about 55,000 foreign workers into South Korea each year. We believe that this scheme will be expanded in the forecast period. In addition, more than 300,000 ethnic Koreans, mainly from China and Russia, are employed in South Korea.
The government will remain keen to attract high-skilled foreign labour. However, locals will continue to pressure the government not to loosen immigration rules and not to make it easier for highly skilled individuals, investors and students to move to South Korea during the forecast period. In addition, language barriers will continue to make it difficult to attract highly skilled individuals. Instead, we expect the government to focus on raising the female participation rate by implementing new social policies, such as expanding subsidised childcare services and free school meals. However, there is a downside risk that such initiatives may be sidelined under Yoon Suk-yeol's administration, as he may cater to growing dissatisfaction among young male groups. Some of these are upset about perceived advantages enjoyed by their female counterparts in the labour market (only male citizens between 18 and 35 years old are required to perform compulsory military service in South Korea, for example). The government will also seek to boost the fertility rate, but progress will be slow owing to the social structure in South Korea.
Many South Koreans remain averse to an open immigration policy for fear of disturbing the societal balance that has prevailed for decades. There has been some flow of refugees from North Korea in recent years, but this has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power in the North. Moreover, the flow of refugees from North Korea is not large enough to have a meaningful effect on demographics in South Korea.

South Korea has one of Asia's largest retail markets, with a highly urbanised population estimated at 51.8m. It is a member of the OECD and is classed by the World Bank as a high-income economy. EIU expects retail sales to continue to grow in 2024-28 on the back of rising household disposable income, resulting from steady economic growth and stable employment. An amendment to the Labour Standards Act led to the enforcement of a weekly limit of 52 working hours in July 2018, including weekday and weekend overtime, reduced from 68 hours previously. A proposal by the conservative-led government to reverse this law and increase working hours to 69 hours a week was foiled in early 2023 by mass protests from trade unions and young workers in particular. The wide opposition in society against such a reversion will dissuade the government from a similar move in the forecast period. Increased leisure time for workers will be positive for retail spending growth.
High household debt will keep a lid on consumer spending growth One potential limit on future spending is the country's high level of household debt. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK, South Korea's central bank), household debt stood at W1,886trn (US$1.4trn) at end-2023, including W118trn in consumer credit. This equates to around four-fifths of GDP. High levels of household indebtedness have exerted a major drag on private consumption in recent years, and we expect the household debt repayment burden to remain high in the first half of the forecast period, amid high borrowing costs. Two factors that will affect future trends are the rapidly ageing population and the diminishing number of young people. These will have a fundamental effect on consumption trends in the long term.
South Korea's traditional retail market is divided between the "big three" high--end department-store chains that are owned by chaebol (family-run conglomerates), namely Lotte Shopping, Shinsegae and Hyundai Department Store, and another "big three" hypermarket chains, namely Emart (owned by the Shinsegae retail group), Home Plus and Lotte Mart (owned by Lotte Shopping), which cater to the mass market. Foreign retailers have a poor record in South Korea, owing to strong competition from local retailers affiliated with the chaebol (South Korea's family-run conglomerates). Costco Wholesale (US), Ministop (Japan) and 7-Eleven (Japan) are the only foreign general-merchandise retailers in the country.

In 2024-28 the majority of household spending will be on food, housing costs, transport and leisure activities. The proportion of household income spent on food, fuel and utilities will rise in 2024 as a result of climbing costs. Over the forecast period policymakers will focus on developing various domestically focused sectors in order to rebalance the economy away from its overdependence on export-oriented manufacturing. This will create market opportunities in the services, healthcare and leisure sectors.
Healthcare spending will increase steeply in 2022-26 South Korea has a well-functioning single-payer system of universal healthcare, the National Health Insurance (NHI). Healthcare reform remains a policy priority for the government. We forecast that total healthcare spending will rise at an average annual growth rate of 7.5% in US dollar terms in 2024-28. The growth rate for pharmaceutical sales will average more than 6% across the forecast period, reflecting an increase in coverage by the NHI.

Initial conditions: South Korea has stood out as one of the few emerging markets to make a successful transition to the ranks of developed economies. However, the next 30 years or so will bring a new set of challenges. As demographic ageing takes hold, South Korea risks stagnating in much the same way as Japan has done since the 1990s. South Korea has outstanding educational standards, which will ensure that the population remains productive, despite a decline in the overall workforce. It will need to reduce its overreliance on large family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, in order to improve competitiveness. However, the biggest impact over the next 30 years may come from events over the border in North Korea and how successive governments choose to respond.
Demographic trends: South Korea's demographic trends are unfavourable, as it will experience rapid demographic ageing in the next few decades. EIU expects that the total population will shrink in 2024-30 and continue to decline in 2031-50. South Korea currently has the lowest fertility rate in the world, at 0.72 births per woman in 2023, and there are few signs that fertility will pick up in the near future, despite the government's efforts to provide cheaper and better childcare and other benefits. Immigration will remain unpopular and will have only a marginal impact in the period to 2050. Increasing female participation in the workforce will be a policy objective for successive governments, but it is doubtful whether they will achieve much success. Moreover, if not combined with sufficient childcare initiatives and labour-market reforms, a rise in the female participation rate will lead to a persistently low birth rate. It is likely to prove easier to persuade more people in their 60s and 70s to continue working for longer, which will ease the costs for society of looking after the rising number of elderly.
External conditions: Despite the efforts of the previous government, South Korea remains overly dependent on export-oriented manufacturing, particularly to provide employment and drive wage growth. However, this sector faces significant headwinds, not least because of rising competition from neighbouring economies such as China and Taiwan. Recognising this challenge, successive governments have sought to bolster South Korea's trading position regionally through free-trade agreements (FTAs) with important trading partners. Not only has it completed such deals with the EU (2011) and the US (revised in 2019), but in 2015 it finally signed a deal with China, its largest trading partner. The need for a trilateral FTA between Japan, South Korea and China has diminished following the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a mega-regional trade deal, which became effective in 2022. The RCEP includes all three countries and will facilitate trade flows between them, while also bolstering South Korea's trade and investment ties with the member states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Despite a turn to a more protectionist attitude towards trade and foreign investment in many countries, South Korea will remain a strong proponent of trade liberalisation. As part of its "New Southern Policy", it will work with ASEAN and India to strengthen trade links. Meanwhile South Korean firms will continue to move production abroad-particularly to South-east Asian countries such as Vietnam, where they are already among the largest investors. This will help firms to keep a lid on costs and also to gain better and closer access to growing markets.
Institutions and policy trends: Over the longer term South Korea will attempt to open its economy more fully to competition as it strives also to diversify its economy. The privileged position of the chaebol industrial groups will also be eroded, and foreign firms will be allowed to compete more freely in the domestic market. The outlook for reform is positive at present, and it is also likely that the industrial structure will have adjusted organically to changing market dynamics by 2050. The expanding presence of foreign investors will force change in areas such as corporate governance, although future governments are likely to take a piecemeal approach towards deregulation.
Long-term performance: Between 2024 and 2050 the working-age population will contract by 1.5%. This will inevitably exert a drag on economic growth, with real GDP expected to rise by just 1.8% per year over the period. The country's ability to maintain its global lead in information technology or to diversify its export base will be an important driver of growth. The services sector will also play an increasingly important role. Less predictable is how the impact of changes in North Korea will affect the country. Should North Korea reform, it could lead to a surge in cross-border trade that would lift potential economic growth in the South. Collapse or conflict in the North, by contrast, could throw South Korea into a hard recession. Any sudden reunification with the North would also have significant consequences, but the potential for catch-up in the North suggests that the peninsula's economy as a whole could grow at a rapid pace for decades after reunification. Our view is that the current two-state situation will persist until 2050, with North Korea retaining its nuclear weapons.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability By signing the Paris Agreement on climate change, South Korea committed to specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Its current target (established in 2015) is to reduce total national GHG emissions by 24.4% from 2017 levels by 2030. According to the government, the target would be attained through a combination of domestic emission reductions and carbon-credit purchases through international market mechanisms. In 2020 the then president, Moon Jae-in, committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and launched a policy package under a "Green New Deal", which aims to promote clean energy in the country. The shift away from coal and nuclear power towards liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy will play a crucial role in achieving these commitments. The Renewable Energy 2030 Implementation Plan mandates a sharp increase in the contribution of renewable energy to power generation, from 7% in 2016 to 20% in 2030. The Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, a rolling 15-year plan that is updated every two years, puts curbs on the addition of nuclear energy capacity and spurs a shift in fuel sources from coal to LNG, on top of a substantial renewable energy build-out in the period to 2031. This would move the country closer to achieving the target level set in 2015. However, EIU believes that South Korea's current emissions-reduction target will not be sufficient to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. We therefore expect the country to propose a stronger emissions-reduction pledge and a revised energy plan, to a reduction of about 45% from 2017 levels by 2030.
We believe that the conservative government under Yoon Suk-yeol will retain the country's climate-change pledge. However, he will roll back the previous government's plan to phase out nuclear energy in the country. Instead, Yoon Suk-yeol sees nuclear energy as an important element in the country's energy mix and central to the achievement of its emission-reduction goals. Consequently, his government will encourage investment in and the development and export of South Korea's nuclear energy technology.
The reduction of coal burning, which is the main source of GHG emissions in the country, is a more complex affair, as South Korea's sizeable network of coal-fired power plants supplied nearly half of the country's electricity output at the end of 2018. The economics of coal also remain favourable compared with LNG: the cost of producing electricity from coal has been stable over the past five years, whereas the import price of LNG has fluctuated widely.
Technological developments Given South Korea's high levels of education, the presence of well-staffed and well-funded research infrastructure and a solid manufacturing base for electronic goods, the country is well poised to make gains from technological changes such as the proliferation of artificial intelligence and increasing automation. According to the 2021 Global Innovation Index, co-published by Cornell University (US), INSEAD (a France-based business school) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (a UN agency), South Korea ranked fifth in the world. The capital, Seoul, ranked fourth globally among subnational clusters of inventive activity (behind Tokyo-Yokohama, Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing); South Korea's conglomerates will remain at the forefront of technological innovation domestically and globally.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geographies in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The centre-left Labor Party holds a narrow majority in the House of Representatives (lower house), but lacks a majority in the Senate (upper house). Its political position is stronger than that suggests, however, owing to the additional support it receives from the Greens and independents, alongside the much-diminished popularity of the former ruling Liberal-National coalition. Domestic priorities for Labor include strengthening public service, fostering stronger collaboration with the private sector and encouraging the green energy transition. In foreign policy, security ties with the US will strengthen through the AUKUS alliance (also involving the UK). This will cast a pall over the Australia-China relationship, despite an ongoing normalisation in ties since Labor returned to power.

This is enough to push up the country one place to 12th in the global ranking, while its position in our regional ranking remains unchanged at fourth. Australia's high ranking reflects strengths across its business environment, notably in foreign trade and exchange controls, policy towards private enterprise, macroeconomic environment and technological readiness. We continue to assign a positive evaluation to political stability and political effectiveness. High wages and a tight labour supply limit the score for the labour market, however, while Australia's small population and geographic remoteness are drags on market opportunities. Australia's score for policy towards foreign investment is limited by an opaque government review process for large foreign-investment proposals.

- Economic performance will be stable over our forecast period (2024-28), despite headwinds to growth. Still-sticky inflation will keep interest rates high in the near term, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (the central bank) resisting monetary easing until late 2024. The government will struggle to tackle housing unaffordability, given the shortage of homes and persistently strong inbound migration. The structural slowdown in China's economy, stemming from the property crisis in the market, will erode the value of Australian commodity exports in 2024-28, compounding the drags on local industries like coal and iron ore as a result of the global green energy transition.

- The Australian population stood at an estimated 26.4m at end-2023, and we expect this figure to rise to 27.3m by 2028. Lower net inward migration will cause growth in the overall and working-age population to slow, to an average of 0.6% and 0.4% respectively in 2024-28. Tightness in labour supply will be a challenge for firms in the early part of the forecast period. Australia's demographic outlook is positive overall and compares favourably with many OECD and Asian economies that are undergoing rapid ageing tied to low fertility rates. Strong government support for childcare is a factor contributing to higher fertility in Australia.

- Australia is geographically remote, with a fairly small population. However, it will remain an attractive and rapidly growing market relative to other economies with a similar level of income per head. High inflation and housing unaffordability will cool some consumer spending in the early years of the forecast period. Almost all industries are open to foreign competition, and the public sector has withdrawn from most areas of the market. Competition in sectors such as consumer goods is fierce and will intensify.

- Real GDP growth will average 1.9% per year in 2024-50. Economic expansion will be supported by export opportunities flowing from bilateral free-trade deals and the country's ties with Asian economies. Australia's population is expected to age more slowly than those of many other OECD countries, owing to continued net immigration. A growing emphasis on higher-value-added services, improvements in human capital and reforms to the regulatory framework will boost productivity in the long term. Geopolitical developments pose risks, with Australia's economy vulnerable in the event of political or military tensions with China (its largest export market).

a Actual.
Background: The Commonwealth of Australia was established in 1901. Since the end of the Second World War the US has replaced the UK as Australia's main defence ally. A mass immigration programme that began in 1947 has resulted in sweeping demographic, cultural and social change, as well as stronger ties with Asian countries. Australia is rich in resources, and booming commodity exports to China have made that country Australia's largest trade partner since 2009.
Political structure: Australia is a democratic federal state within the Commonwealth of Nations. Executive power is vested in the governor-general (who represents King Charles III), but is exercised by the prime minister. The legislature consists of a federal parliament comprising a 76-member Senate (the upper house) and a 151-seat House of Representatives (the lower house). Elections are held at intervals of about three years, when half of the senators representing the states (who serve six-year terms), all of the senators representing the territories (who serve three-year terms) and all members of the lower house are elected by compulsory ballot. All representatives in both houses of parliament can face election if certain conditions are met and a "double-dissolution" election is called. Each of the six states in the federation has its own government, with a governor and a bicameral legislature (apart from Queensland, which has a unicameral legislature)
Policy issues: Persistently high inflation and an ongoing housing crisis are the main near-term policy issues. The government has been targeted in its additional support to households, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (the central bank) will not cut interest rates until late 2024, at the earliest. Housing affordability will persist as an area of socioeconomic concern, stemming from years of mismatch between supply and demand. Australia will seek to diversify its trade reliance on China, even as bilateral relations stabilise, but the size of the Chinese market will complicate long-lasting export diversification. Australia's approach to limiting climate change has been stiffened by legislation passed in 2022.
Taxation: Personal income tax is progressive, with the top marginal rate of 45% levied on earnings of more than A$200,000 (US$125,000) starting from July 2024. A levy of 2% of personal taxable income is collected to contribute to healthcare costs.
Foreign trade: According to the IMF, goods exports reached US$371.5bn in 2023, while imports (CIF basis) reached US$291.8bn. Australia's trade surplus reached US$79.5bn that year.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Australia is a parliamentary and federal democracy. The legislature is made up of two chambers, a 151-member House of Representatives (the lower house) and a 76-member Senate (the upper house). Political power is held by the party with a majority in the lower house, although it must work with the Senate to pass legislation. The centre-left Labor Party returned to government in May 2022, displacing the centre-right Liberal-National coalition that had held power since 2013. Labor holds 78 seats, providing it with a slim majority, with the coalition holding 55. The remainder are held by independents and the Greens.
Labor lacks a majority in the Senate, where it holds 26 seats, compared with 31 for the coalition. The lack of a Senate majority for the government has become a feature of Australian politics, owing to the preferential system of voting used for lower-house elections, which typically gives a majority of seats to either the coalition or Labor, while under-representing smaller parties. By contrast, the Senate is elected by a system of proportional representation (via single transferable vote) and typically gives greater representation to smaller parties. The potential for non-alignment between the lower and upper houses is increased by the fact that members of the lower house serve three-year terms, whereas senators normally serve six, with just over half of the seats being contested in any election. Forty senate seats were contested at the time of the May 2022 federal election.
The balance of power in the Senate is held by a crossbench of 19 Green, independent and minor-party senators. Labor will work with the Greens to develop a working majority for passing legislation, although tensions over climate-related legislation-such as the Future Gas Strategy-may periodically complicate co-operation. The government can dissolve both houses of parliament and call a "double-dissolution" election for all of the seats in both chambers if the Senate twice rejects a proposed piece of legislation.

Political outlook: Political stability The outlook for political stability is positive under the centre-left Labor Party, which returned to power at the federal election in May 2022. Despite having only a narrow majority in the House of Representatives (the lower house) and a minority of seats in the Senate (the upper house), Labor can draw on support for key areas of its policy agenda from the Greens and independent senators. Such support has already helped Labor to pass major legislation related to climate change and corruption. Party discipline will remain much improved under the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, than when it was last in office, in 2007-13.
Political stability will be assisted by the weakness of the former ruling Liberal-National coalition. Two major scandals in the past two years, on ministerial appointments and benefit entitlements, have tarnished the Liberals' reputation. The coalition's leader, Peter Dutton, hails from the conservative wing of the Liberal Party and will struggle to appeal to centrist voters. Many of the party's moderate MPs were defeated at the last election by "teal" independents. This group tends to hold similarly conservative economic views but are more progressive on social issues. These factors have pushed the Liberals further to the right. Consequently, EIU believes that the coalition will struggle to formulate an effective response to progressive Labor policies that have moved into the political centre ground, including mitigating climate change and reducing inequality.
Some risks to political stability will come to the fore ahead of the next election, due in mid-2025. The government is struggling to tackle a housing crisis, in which private rents have soared amid a structural shortage of homes and a spell of high net inward migration. The economy has coped well with a period of high consumer price inflation and above-neutral interest rates, but households are growing restive amid difficult conditions. The government acknowledged this in early 2024 when it announced revisions to the Stage 3 tax cuts legislated by the previous coalition government; more of the savings will now be directed to those in the lower- and middle-income brackets. However, as Labor had repeatedly promised to implement the tax cuts in full, the opposition coalition will use the adjustments as evidence that the government cannot be trusted. Sparring over climate policy with the Greens and independents will also intensify, given the rising incidence of flooding and other climate-related events and the reliance of Australia's economy on mining and the global energy security agenda.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Australia's bureaucracy is of a high quality and the legal system is transparent and efficient. Institutional effectiveness is consequently high, although there remain several areas of ongoing reform. Revelations that the former prime minister, Scott Morrison, secretly appointed himself to ministerial roles during the covid-19 pandemic highlighted weaknesses in the integrity and transparency of government; subsequent rule-changes should close such loopholes. Public-sector corruption, while relatively low by international standards, persists as an area of concern. The creation of a National Anti-Corruption Commission, established in July 2023, aims to drive a more centralised approach. It will investigate suspected corruption across the country, both retrospectively and prospectively, covering government ministers, members of parliament and officials.
The structure of the Senate makes it difficult for the governing party to gain a majority in the chamber, which ensures that the checks and balances on government policy are strong. Although such a structure encourages consensus-building, it is also a source of political ineffectiveness, as securing the passage of legislation through both houses of parliament usually requires the backing of either the opposition or minor parties and independents. However, cross-party co-operation has been noted in rare instances, such as the stringent measures taken to control the outbreak of the coronavirus and bipartisan views regarding the risk posed to national security by China.
Tensions between the federal and state governments are a characteristic of the political landscape. These are a product of Australia's constitutional law, which assigns most revenue-raising powers to the federal authorities but gives the six states and two territories primary financial responsibility for providing many public services. Reform of the framework for distributing revenue collected from the goods and services tax (GST), which was legislated in 2018, has helped to reduce friction between the states and the federal government.
In general, centre-local government disputes tend to be concentrated in areas where both tiers of government are active and in which cost-cutting by one tier imposes additional expenses on the other, such as healthcare. Education and health are major areas of responsibility for the states but also receive substantial federal funding, and will therefore be major battlegrounds. The environment, water, ports, infrastructure, tax and business regulation are also areas of conflict, owing to overlapping responsibility between the two levels of government. Some of these divisions were apparent during the pandemic, when state and territory governments were more proactive than the federal administration in imposing restrictions and shutting domestic borders.
Political outlook: Election watch Labor holds 77 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, with the coalition occupying 58 seats. The 2022 election was less a strong endorsement of Labor, whose share of the popular vote fell relative to the 2019 poll, and more a repudiation of the coalition, whose support declined by a larger margin. Opinion polling suggests that Labor's popularity has declined since peaking in mid-2022, with some of its support moving rightwards to the coalition, and some to the Greens on the left. This is a fairly natural state of affairs in Australia, where governments usually lose support once established in office.
The next election must be held before mid-2025. Labor is unlikely to consider calling an early election, given that its tax adjustments and the start of interest-rate cuts in the second half of 2024 are unlikely to boost to its poll ratings until early 2025. The influence of minor parties and independents on policy is rising. The strongest gains at the 2022 election were made by the Greens and independents (led by the loosely aligned "teal" politicians). Labor seeks co-operation with these groups on an issue-by-issue basis in order to put legislation through the Senate.
The rejection of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament in a referendum in late 2023 has diminished the likelihood of a vote on the establishment of an Australian republic. Nevertheless, there remains a possibility of Labor including it as a campaign pledge ahead of the next election. If the party wins again, a vote could be held soon after. Mr Albanese supports a republic and has created the role of assistant minister for the republic in his cabinet.
Political outlook: International relations Australia will continue to back efforts to isolate Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Albanese has also irked Israel by voting at the UN in support of a ceasefire in Gaza. Australia is tightening ties with the UK and the US under the AUKUS defence pact to militate against security risks associated with China's expanding regional footprint. Australia will acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the agreement, initially purchased from the US and ultimately (in the 2040s) manufactured locally, using US technology and a UK design. The development of this capability will involve intense trilateral co-operation and extensive integration across the defence industry.
AUKUS will remain a sore point in relations with China, which are otherwise improving. Mr Albanese's successful visit to the country in late 2023 has facilitated the ongoing removal of Chinese punitive tariffs-imposed in 2020-21 amid a diplomatic dispute-across a wide range of imports. A normalisation in trade flows will preserve China's role as Australia's most important economic partner, despite some diversification in its export markets in 2021-22. A rehabilitation of trade ties are nevertheless balanced against ongoing Australian concerns over China's regional security ambitions. Australia's involvement in AUKUS makes it likely that it would become directly involved in the event of a military clash in the region between China and the US, including as a result of hostilities over Taiwan or in the South China Sea. Nevertheless, Australia will remain cautious of US attempts to invite other regional partners, such as Japan, into the framework, because of concern about whether enlargement would complicate AUKUS's original goals.
Relations with India and Japan will be a strategic priority for Australia; both are fellow members of the Quad diplomatic group, alongside the US. Australia will also deepen its engagement with its Pacific island neighbours to offset China's expanding regional influence. In 2023 Australia signed a defence pact formalising its security arrangements with Papua New Guinea. Australia also broke new ground in late 2023 by offering permanent migration to residents of Tuvalu, acknowledging the existential threat posed to that country by climate change; it may extend this offer to other Pacific island countries. More climate aid and development resources will be allocated to the region, assisted by Labor's adoption of a more ambitious climate-change policy.

Overview: Australia's overall score rises to 8.14 in 2024-28, from 8 in 2019-23, enabling it to climb a single place in EIU's global ranking, to 12th and hold onto fourth position in our Asia ranking. The improvement is driven by upgrades to the macroeconomic environment and market opportunities categories; we expect the economy to perform steadily in the coming years, even as some structural macro-economic headwinds intensify. Policy on taxes and foreign trade will improve, owing to income tax relief and the normalisation of trade ties with China. These will offset a mild decline in political stability, as well as more obvious deteriorations in policy towards foreign investment and the labour market.
Strengths: Australia's political environment is one of the strongest in the world. There is deep respect for democracy, with compulsory voting and a three-year voting cycle keeping the electorate engaged. There is also a genuine choice to voters, with marked policy differentiation between the Greens on the left and the National Party on the right. Political stability is expected to slip in the coming years, with the rise of "teal" independents complicating efforts by either of the two main political parties to form lower-house majorities.
Weaknesses: The labour market is Australia's weakest category and is expected to deteriorate in 2024-28. Wages are extremely high, the ruling Labor Party has given fresh impetus to the union movement and the cost of living will continue to spur strikes and lockouts in the coming years. The government will sharply reduce the number of international students in the forecast period, which will cut the supply of skilled labour.
What to watch
- Australia's political and economic relationship with China remains critically important to the performance of the Australia's economy. Our base case assumes that Chinese demand for Australian commodities will weaken in 2024-28, as activity in China's property sector remains below its historical trend. The two governments have repaired the rupture of 2020-21, but lingering security tensions will prevent the political relationship from warming significantly.

Business environment outlook: Australia's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The government decries a lack of competition in the grocery sector, but struggles for meaningful measures to weaken the dominance of the two major supermarkets.
2026-28: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission takes a greater interest in firms' environmental credentials, risking more punitive actions for false claims.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Asset acquisitions by foreign state-owned investors-notably those from China-face tough scrutiny.
2026-28: Restrictions are maintained on foreign investment in "sensitive" sectors such as banking, agriculture and media.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The government encourages businesses to deepen commercial ties with India and South-east Asia, as part of efforts to diversify trade from China, but progress is constrained by China's lifting of punitive import measures.
2026-28: Free-trade negotiations with the EU resume in 2026 after a pause of three years.
Taxes 2024-25: The Labor government implements stage 3 tax cuts that are more progressive than those legislated by the Liberal-National coalition.
2026-28: Higher taxes come into effect on large superannuation (pension) holdings, and some tax breaks for landlords are pared back. Debate intensifies over the need for a higher rate for the goods and services tax.
Financing 2024-25: Financing costs remain elevated, curtailing credit growth. Costs begin to fall only from early 2025, after the Reserve Bank of Australia (the central bank) begins to lower its policy rate in response to slower inflation.
2026-28: Firms generally enjoy good access to medium-term finance. Reforms to the banking sector resume.
The labour market 2024-25: A slowing economy causes the unemployment rate to rise, relieving wage pressures on employers.
2026-28: Skilled migration remains above its long-term average as the labour market continues to absorb new arrivals.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Revisions to the federal infrastructure pipeline mean that fewer projects proceed, but transport networks and green energy projects remain areas of focus.
2026-28: Work continues on a range of infrastructure projects, focusing particularly on roads, railways (including the Sydney Metro) and airports, as well as the expansion of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Mobile broadband speeds improve dramatically with the rollout of 5G networks. The government increases its budget outlay for cyber-security and resilience.
2026-28: Privatisation of the National Broadband Network returns to the political agenda. The government makes progress on its Digital Transformation Strategy and deployment of the internet of things.

Overview: Australia's score in the macroeconomic environment category improves in EIU's forecast period and its position in the global and regional rankings rises. Economic growth will remain tepid while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA, the central bank) holds interest rates at above-neutral levels in order to bring down consumer price inflation. From 2025, however, the economy will benefit from income tax cuts, public investment in green technologies and continued (if somewhat reduced) external demand for the country's commodity wealth. The economy is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with more frequent and more severe episodes of extreme weather occurring in recent years.
Strengths: The economy will perform better in 2024-28 than in 2019-23, when it was assailed by the many and complex effects of the covid-19 pandemic. Absent another major supply shock, consumer price inflation should be easier for policymakers to manage, which would also result in lower interest rates and less onerous debt-repayment conditions for stretched households. The economy has begun the process of diversifying from China, a trend that will continue in the next five years and will add to its resilience to future shocks.
Weaknesses: The housing sector continues to present a major risk to overall economic performance. The country's long-standing shortfall has pushed up prices to very high levels. Prices fell when the RBA began to tighten interest rates, but began to climb again once buyers were satisfied that rates had reached the peak in the current cycle. High levels of net inward migration have also pushed up demand. There are multiple consequences for the economy. Private rents have held up the process of slowing inflation and reducing interest rates, while more of household income is being spent on mortgage payments. The biggest risk remains mortgage defaults rising to the point where prices drop in a disorderly manner. Buyers of expensive properties with small deposits during the pandemic are particularly vulnerable to entering negative equity and losing the ability to afford their repayments. The risk of this outcome is small, but the potential impact on the broader economy is fairly large.
What to watch
- Chinese demand for Australian commodities in 2024-28 will weaken against the historical period, given the ongoing crisis in China's property sector (a major consumer of Australian iron ore and other minerals). The speed at which export sales slow will be an influential factor on the overall pace of GDP growth, such has been the scale of exports to China in the past 20 years.

Overview: Australia's score for policy towards private enterprise improves in 2024-28, pushing the country from fifth to third place in our global rankings. The Labor government has prioritised reducing anti-competitive practices. A Senate inquiry into pricing by the country's two largest supermarket chains is ongoing. The government will not break up the firms, but it will consider steps to make market entry easier (although we expect this to be difficult in practice). Another area of focus will be greenwashing by companies across the economy. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be handed a remit to investigate environmental claims as the country transitions towards a lower-carbon future.
Strengths: Interactions between the public and private sectors will be monitored more closely in 2024-28 following the creation of a National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) in 2022. Although primarily focused on the activities of public servants, the NACC has the power to examine the behaviour of lobbyists and anyone who could "adversely affect" the decisions of public officials.
Weaknesses: The period of high consumer price inflation in 2022-24 has highlighted the lack of competition in the economy. An inquiry by the bipartisan economics committee of the House of Representatives (the lower house) argued in early 2024 that living standards were under threat from low competition. It believes that an increase in market concentration has resulted in higher prices and lower choices for consumers. Among its recommendations, we expect the government to legislate that all mergers above a yet-to-be-defined level must be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for approval. At present, the ACCC examines only about 20% of the total.
What to watch
- Electricity prices will be an area of focus for the government and of contention for consumers in the coming years. An ACCC enquiry in late 2023 found that almost 80% of consumers were paying equal to or more than the median offer on plan-comparison websites, suggesting that millions of Australians could save money by switching their electricity supplier. The report was also critical of electricity retailers making it unnecessarily difficult for customers to switch suppliers.

Overview: Australia remains generally welcoming towards foreign investment, but there are more areas in which the government is very sensitive-a trend we expect to continue in 2024-28. This explains the decline in its index score in the forecast period. Large foreign investments are subject to a screening process by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), although most proposals reviewed by the agency receive approval. The general threshold for the screening of private-sector foreign investment by the FIRB is revised annually and stands at A$330m (US$219m) for 2024. The thresholds are much tighter for agriculture, energy, media and other sensitive sectors, but looser for investors from countries with which Australia has free-trade agreements (FTAs).
Strengths: Formal mechanisms to identify and provide incentives for major investment projects will remain in place. To qualify, projects must have the potential to bring substantial economic and employment benefits. The Major Project Facilitation Agency, administered by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, is open to investments of more than A$20m in all sectors, although projects are mainly resource-related. (There is additional help for projects worth over A$50m.) State governments may also offer incentives, such as holidays from payroll tax.
Weaknesses: The screening process for potential acquisitions of Australian asses by Chinese firms will be particularly thorough. Proposals to acquire energy transmission and distribution assets, and other assets deemed to be critical infrastructure, will come under even closer scrutiny. In 2023 the government blocked the takeover of a struggling Australian lithium miner, Alita Resources, by a local company, Austroid, because its director was a Chinese national with experience of the Chinese mining industry. The Chinese government regularly complains that Australia discriminates against Chinese firms in making investment decisions.
What to watch
- Foreign owners of Australian properties should expect to face penalties in the coming years if they are found to be leaving houses and apartments vacant. The government is keen to boost housing stock amid the national housing shortage, even as they resist more politically contentious reforms (such as ending negative gearing or advocating for high density housing). Application processing fees for would-be foreign owners are also likely to rise steeply.

Overview: Australia's continued commitment to and pursuit of free trade will raise its score for foreign trade and exchange controls in the coming years, pushing up its global rank from 25th to 11th in 2024-28. Most imports under Australia's growing number of FTAs and from developing countries enter the country tariff-free. The trade regime is liberal and there are no import quotas. The protectionist sentiment that has arisen in other developed countries has not taken root in Australia, which has benefited economically from open trade relationships. Consequently, we expect successive governments to continue to pursue a combination of bilateral and multilateral negotiations to promote Australia's commercial interests. There are no restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange and no exchange controls. A reporting system for cash payments records all transactions of A$10,000 (US$6,700) or more for tax-matching purposes.
Strengths: The Labor government has been successful in restoring the Australia-China bilateral trade relationship after China imposed punitive tariffs on a range of Australian goods in 2021. Tariffs on wine imports were lifted in early 2024, with remaining duties on Australian beef and crustaceans likely to be rescinded by mid-year. Although we expect Chinese demand for Australian commodities to weaken in the forecast period, China remains the country's largest trading partner and a stable economic relationship is crucial for the overall health of the economy.
Weaknesses: The Australian government ended negotiations on an FTA with the EU, which had been years in the making, in late 2023. We expect that European interest in securing better access to Australian rare-earth minerals will result in negotiations restarting, but not until after the European Parliament elections in mid-2024 and the Australian election in 2025.
What to watch
- Deepening the trade relationship with India is a strategic priority for the Australian government. Negotiations are currently finalising a Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement that builds on the existing trade agreement. There remains huge potential in the relationship: Indian firms looking at Australia still predominately target Indian expats living there, while demand for Australian coal and solar technology is growing quickly. Australia is also supportive of expanding the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacfic Partnership (CPTPP), a regional mega-trade deal, although discussions on facilitating China's potential ascension will remain complicated by other tensions in the Australia-China diplomatic relationship.

Overview: Australia's score for taxes rises to 8 in 2024-28, and its global ranking climbs four places to 17th. The top personal income tax rate is high, at 45% for incomes of more than A$180,000, with marginal tax rates of 32.5% on incomes of more than A$45,000 and 37% on those above A$120,000 for fiscal year 2023/24 (July-June). There is also a 2% levy to fund the universal healthcare scheme, Medicare. The standard corporate tax rate of 30% is among the highest in the OECD. Small and medium-sized businesses are taxed at 25%.
Strengths: Labor has announced major changes to the stage 3 tax cuts that were legislated by the Liberal-National coalition government in 2019. From July (marking the beginning of the 2024/25 fiscal year), the threshold for the 37% rate will be raised to A$135,000 and for the 45% rate to A$190,000. The rate of the bottom bracket will be cut from 19% to 16%. The government believes that these changes will cost the same as the coalition's plans, which would have seen the bulk of the benefit directed at very high earners, but will result in more Australians receiving a tax cut.
Weaknesses: Amid a housing crisis that is causing the government to implement policies that are likely to compromise long-term economic growth (such as cutting the number of visa for foreign students), the tax system still permits generous deductions for landlords. Both Labor and the Liberal-National coalition remain in favour of negative gearing, which allows landlords to deduct any losses they make on their investment properties (for example, if repairs and maintenance are larger than the rent they receive from tenants) from their income tax bill. The benefits of negative gearing are tilted towards older and wealthier Australians, however, meaning that the measure stands in opposition to the federal government's focus on reducing generational inequality. This will preserve housing unaffordability as an issue, particularly for younger Australians.
What to watch
- There will be periodic debate about the need for a higher rate of goods and services tax (GST). Future changes could include an increase in the tax rate, currently at 10%, or a broadening of the tax base. For any change to occur, it must have the support of all state governments and the federal authorities and is therefore subject to a high threshold. A higher rate of GST is more likely to occur under a federal Labor administration than one run by the Liberal-National coalition.

Overview: Australia has a sophisticated financial system in which foreign and domestic firms compete on equal terms. Foreign investors have access to local capital markets and companies generally enjoy good access to medium-term finance. Australia's score for financing remains at 8.5 in 2024-28, triggering a fall from second to tenth place globally (reflecting stronger improvements elsewhere). The risk of a banking sector crisis that might prevent access to credit or liquidity is low, although the local sector net external liability position indicates its reliance on smooth global funding. Profitability in the sector is likely to fall in 2025, as we expect an eventual (but gradual) decline in interest rates back to neutral levels starting from late 2024. The country's commercial banks will pass the vast majority of these cuts on to their clients.
Strengths: The central bank is undergoing major changes as a result of a Labor government inquiry, which we believe will improve its performance. The RBA's independence is respected, but the government wants to ensure it by removing a clause that allows parliament to over-rule RBA decisions. The RBA also stands to benefit from the appointment of a specific monetary policy board of experts to work alongside the existing board, who will focus on governance. These changes are subject to legislative approval in the coming year.
Weaknesses: Australia's banking sector is open and competitive, but will remain concentrated by international standards. The sector is dominated by four major banks: Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ), National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac, together which held 72% of the sector's assets in 2023. It was notable that a tribunal overturned the ACCC's previous block on the acquisition of Suncorp, a smaller lender, by ANZ in early 2024, by putting the burden of proof on the ACCC to prove that the purchase would be anti-competitive. This suggests that the sector is only likely to become more concentrated in the coming years, but a merger between any of the big four is highly unlikely.
What to watch
- Banks' credit impairment costs are worth watching as a proxy for the impact of households' mortgage stress on the banking sector. NAB, for example, announced a rise of 17% quarter on quarter for October-December in its impairment bill, to A$190m. Delinquency rates remain contained, at under 2%, for now, but these are likely to rise for as long as the RBA keeps interest rates at above-neutral levels.

Overview: Australia's labour market score is its weakest in the categories and slips from 6.9 in 2019-23 to 6.6 in 2024-28, pulling down its global ranking from 19th to 32nd place. Australia has a deep pool of highly educated and skilled workers, but wages are very high, the union movement is strong and hiring additional foreign employees is difficult. The main piece of industrial relations legislation, the Fair Work Act, is accompanied by National Employment Standards-a set of ten minimum, non-negotiable employment conditions. Australia also has a system of more than 100 awards; these are legally binding rulings that set minimum wage and employment conditions for workers in a given industry or occupation. Two government bodies, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) and the Fair Work Ombudsman, have a regulatory role in setting minimum wages and enforcing compliance with the Fair Work Act.
Strengths: Although workers are unhappy about the rising cost of living and firms are dissatisfied with the difficulty of hiring workers, the Australian labour market is fundamentally enjoying a successful period. Unemployment has been below its long-run average for several years. We do not expect unemployment to rise above levels previous considered normal while interest rates remain elevated, owing largely to the fact that underlying demand remains relatively healthy, despite the squeeze on household and business costs.
Weaknesses: Political considerations are interfering with businesses desires to increase the supply of labour. The government has cut its visa issuance for foreign students in the coming years dramatically, which will impede the supply of skilled labour long after the current period of high inflation ends.
What to watch
- The government will continue to look to improve working conditions in the remainder of its term and will maintain this goal if it is re-elected in 2025. A slew of industrial relations provisions were passed in late 2023 and more are imminent, including protections under the FWC for workers in the gig economy.

Overview: Australia has extensive and well-developed infrastructure in roads, railways, airports, telecommunications, energy distribution and water supply. However, the geographical extent of the country relative to the small population will stretch limited resources, which means that the country ranks only 32nd globally in this category. Continued investment in port and rail networks will be needed for Australia to take full advantage of demand for agricultural and mineral-resource commodities created by ongoing develop-ment in Asia. Much of this is undertaken by the corporate sector; the major mining companies typically invest in the entire supply chain, from mine to port. State and federal government spending on transport-particularly in the major cities-and other infrastructure is likely to increase in 2024-28, with the government supporting green energy transition efforts in particular (such as through an upgrade to the electricity network and rollout of electric vehicles).
Strengths: The federal government is getting to grips with problems in the planning and allocation of resources for infrastructure projects. Infrastructure Australia is charged with specifying national and state-level priorities, but that organisation has been subject to political pressure in recent years. Federal and state governments have been guilty of trying to sideline it in order to promote projects viewed as politically advantageous. A government-commissioned independent review in late 2023 recommended axing 50 projects worth A$11.6bn because of their dubious economic merit. A continuation of this more thorough process to assess infrastructure projects is likely to result in more efficient use of public spending.
Weaknesses: Australia has a poor track record of delivering public infrastructure projects on time and within budget. During her 2023 review of the country's pipeline, the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, noted that budget plans had been hit by the increase of construction materials (partly because of the damage to supply chains during the covid-19 pandemic), the impact of a tight labour market on the cost of labour, and competition between the public and private sectors (notably big mining companies) for materials and workers. We believe that the government will be more realistic in the number of projects it will approve in 2024-28, but also that the number of major projects completed will be relatively small.
What to watch
- The fate of NBN, the state-owned entity that operates much of the country's broadband network, is likely to be debated again in the next five years. Officials originally intended for NBN to eventually be privatised once the roll-out of the network was complete and the company had millions of paying subscribers. Costs have been higher than expected at every stage, however, and the company remains heavily indebted. If the government is able to stabilise NBN financial performance in 2024-28, such as through the launch of faster services, privatisation may again become a consideration.

Overview: Australia's score for technological readiness remains at 8.6. Improvements elsewhere have resulted in Australia's global ranking dropping from 14th to 18th. In effect, the entire population uses the internet, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), and almost everyone uses social media or other communication apps. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital communications, according to ACMA, with only 18% of Australians making a landline phone call at home in the first half of 2023. More than four-fifths of those aged over 75 used a mobile phone to access the internet in the survey period, compared with just one-third in 2017. With the country's elderly increasingly online, all age groups in Australia can be said to be digitally proficient.
Strengths: The country's online architecture is reliable and relatively fast. According to the Speedtest Global Index, Australia ranked 25th out of 143 countries for its mobile internet speed in April 2024. (Its fixed speed was markedly less impressive, at 94th out of 181 countries.) Currently, 5G services are available to most major urban centres and rural access will improve rapidly in the forecast period.
Weaknesses: The government recognises that cybercrime is a growing threat and will continue to invest in cyber-security in 2024-28. Nevertheless, its efforts have been unable to stop major companies falling victim to hacks. Optus, Medibank, Nissan and DP World are among the high-profile firms to have had their systems breached in the past 18 months. In the Optus hack, personal details of 10m Australians were stolen, while the DP World attack halted work at several of the countries' busiest ports.
What to watch
- The tense diplomatic relationship between Australia and China often spills into the digital sphere, including periodic reporting of Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage against Australian officials. The latest allegations, issued in May 2024, concerned Chinese hacking attempts against six Australian members of parliament; similar cyber-attacks were recorded in September 2019. Incidents of electoral interference-as well as claims of foreign manipulation, whether real or unsubstantiated-are likely to occur ahead of future political events, and may include attempted thefts of voter data or the publication of disinformation campaigns. This could include tactics common to China's cyber-harassment of other economies, such as Taiwan, involving bots or fake social-media accounts; all of these incidents will test the resilience of Australia's digital architecture.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Labor supports a stronger role for the state in the economy, as part of its agenda to build a fairer and more prosperous society. Competition policy is being stiffened, as are rights for workers vis-à-vis their employers. The government is also pushing a new industrial strategy and will offer a range of subsidies for investments in sectors where it wants to cultivate comparative advantages and lessen its reliance on complex international supply chains. These include critical minerals processing and renewable energy. The government has come under pressure to increase the housing supply. In late 2023 it successfully pushed its long-awaited social housing fund through the Senate (the fund will involve the government borrowing at low interest rates to reinvest in private companies, and using the expected profits to finance investment in new developments), but this is a long-term policy that will take years to reduce the housing backlog.
On climate change, the government has increased the responsibility of mining firms and car manufacturers for reducing carbon emissions from their respective sectors. The reforms are part of a package of measures designed to deliver a reduction in emissions to 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, and eventually to net zero by 2050. Other areas where tougher regulatory standards will be imposed include buildings, waste disposal and farms. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is also laying the groundwork for large public investments in the electricity network, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and battery manufacturing.

Government revenue 35.9 34.7 33.9 33.9 33.9 33.9
Budget balance -0.8 -1.0 -1.2 -1.0 -0.3 0.1
Government debt 56.6 55.6 55.1 54.7 53.7 52.3
In the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Mr Chalmers revealed that a surge in tax revenue would likely underpin a second consecutive surplus in fiscal year 2023/24 (July-June). EIU's budget data are recorded on a calendar-year basis and estimated a narrow deficit in 2023, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP for 2023. We forecast similar-sized annual deficits in 2024-26, given moderating commodity prices and the impact on revenue of imminent cuts in income tax.
Meanwhile, pressure on expenditure will come from higher defence costs associated with the AUKUS submarines, as well as rising expense on healthcare and welfare. This will keep the public debt ratio elevated in the coming years; it will soften from 57% of GDP in 2023 to 52% of GDP by 2028, but will remain above the pre-pandemic rate of about 45% of GDP.
The government's revisions to the Stage 3 income-tax cuts have made the changes slightly more progressive without becoming any more expensive. Under Labor's plan, those earning under A$45,000 (US$30,000) will be taxed at 16% rather than the current 19%; a new 30% bracket will cover those earning up to A$135,000; and the 45% bracket will apply only to those earning more than A$190,000. No Australian will pay more tax under the new plan than the existing system, but some high-income earners will not receive the savings that they were promised under the cuts legislated by the coalition.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

Deposit rate (av) 3.3 3.2 2.7 3.0 3.0 3.0
Money market rate (av) 4.3 4.1 2.8 2.6 2.4 2.3
Stubborn consumer price inflation means that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA, the central bank) will keep its policy interest rate, the official cash rate (OCR), at 4.35% until December 2024. Pockets of inflation, notably in the private rental sector, are preventing overall price growth from moderating quickly. Labour market resilience is also underpinning private spending, such that the adjustment to a slower inflation rate will take more time.
From 2025 we expect the RBA to move gradually, reducing the OCR by 25 basis points per quarter until early 2026. By that point, the OCR will be about 2.75%, a level that we consider to be broadly neutral. Australia's elevated level of household debt means that higher rates will cause some debt-servicing strains, but effective oversight will keep the risk of banking system instability low.

The economy will remain relatively resilient in 2024-25, despite Australia's above-neutral policy interest rate, with real GDP expanding by 2% this year. Tight monetary policy will continue to squeeze private consumption, with mortgage payments remaining high and real wages declining (modestly) for a fourth consecutive year. These factors will also weigh on private investment, although public investment will be supported by the government's green energy initiatives and improvements to transport infrastructure. A slowdown in exports, partly reflecting persistent challenges in the property sector in China (Australia's largest overseas market), as well a muted global outlook, means that net exports will make only a fractional contribution to growth in 2024, after adding more than one percentage point in 2023.
Economic growth will settle to a range of 1.5-2.5% in the period to 2028. This will be slower than the trend in the 2010s, owing mainly to weaker expansion in the mining sector. Although the development of rare earth and green hydrogen resources will provide tailwinds, changing demand for commodities in China and the global climate-change agenda will ultimately drag on the sector. A heavy reliance on mining limits the economy's ability to pivot away from this sector, despite Australia's superior business environment; this has depressed the country's advancement in technology and investment in research and development. The green energy and defence sectors will prove exceptions to this trend, however, aided by government policy support for the energy transition and the development of local manufacturing capabilities in defence.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Australia's advanced services sector accounted for 68.3% of GDP in 2023 and shares many of the characteristics of its OECD peers. After a swift recovery in the years following the pandemic, services spending will cool. Resilience in related expenditure will nonetheless preserve pockets of significant inflationary pressure in the wider economy throughout 2024, even as high interest rates and elevated rents discourage some related consumer expenditure. Value-added growth in the services industry will rebound in 2025, as financial conditions ease, before settling at a slightly below-trend growth rate (1.7%) in 2026-28.
Other mainstays of Australia's services sector include financial and insurance services, education and training, public administration and healthcare. Some of the strongest growth over the past decade has been seen in areas such as professional and scientific services, as well as information media and telecommunications. The services sector will retain a dominant role in the economy, supported by high levels of private consumption and the demand created by the resources sector. Its share of the economy will remain just under 70% throughout our forecast period (2024-28).
Mining has been lifted by geopolitical developments Australia's industrial sector accounted for 28.6% of GDP in 2023. The importance of manufacturing has declined steadily, symbolised by the closure of the last car manufacturing plant in 2017. The sector is unlikely to re-emerge as a major driver of economic activity, although there will be pockets of growth such as the defence manufacturing industry as the government looks to localise more of the supply chain, including under the AUKUS framework.
The government's Future Made in Australia strategy, unveiled in April 2024, represents the Labor government's response to the global industrial policy race. As part of this, we expect stronger publicly-directed investment into Australia's infrastructure and clean energy sectors, which should support some future growth in the industrial sector over 2024-28. Nevertheless, many of these projects will need to navigate long timelines in regard to feasibility studies and securing both federal and state government approvals. These factors-alongside Australia's higher labour, land and utility costs vis-à-vis its Asian neighbours-suggest that this strategy will struggle to meaningfully transform Australia's industrial landscape within our five-year forecast period, particularly absent deeper fiscal support from federal authorities.
The mining sector's importance, by contrast, remains and will persist as a significant driver of the Australian economy. It now accounts for about 14.3% of total GDP, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, and far exceeds construction in terms of its share of economic output. This reflects a decade-long boom in Chinese demand for Australian commodities, led by iron ore. More recently, the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have also stimulated global demand for new supplies of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that Australia holds in rich supply. Headwinds facing the sector include softer Chinese demand and the global climate-change agenda; ongoing stress in China's property sector, in particular, will keep the value of Australian iron-ore exports in 2024-25 below the highs recorded in 2020-mid 2021 (when the Chinese housing crisis began). Nevertheless, steel demand tied to the Chinese automotive, green energy, infrastructure and shipbuilding sectors will keep a floor under Australian mineral export growth. Beyond China, the development of the green hydrogen and rare-earth supply chains present some opportunities for the sector, although capitalising on these trends will depend on the political will of Australian policymakers to embrace green-energy themes domestically.
The agriculture sector, which accounted for 3% of GDP in 2023, is supported by Australia's competiveness in livestock and dairy farming. Strong demand for such produce in Asia points to a rosy outlook for the sector, although its performance can be uneven owing to Australia's vulnerability to extreme weather events, including flooding and wild fires. Much also depends on the success of schemes to control irrigation in the country's hugely important Murray-Darling Basin, which has suffered significantly from periods of protracted drought. The long-term health of the river system depends on limiting how much of the basin's water is used for agricultural purposes.

We expect consumer price inflation to return to the midpoint of the RBA's 2-3% target band by the first quarter of 2025. A gradual suppression of consumer demand will underpin this moderation as higher interest rates feed into the economy. Upward pressure on prices will continue to come from the accommodation, insurance and energy segments. The El Niño weather phenomenon predicted over the 2023-24 Australian summer has not, however, resulted in the below-average rainfall that was feared. By contrast, wetter conditions have underpinned better-than-expected agricultural harvests, including for wheat and barley, which will contain local food price growth.
The entrenchment of inflationary expectations represents the biggest upside risk that could push price growth higher in 2024-25. Public-sector wage demands suggest that this risk is significant. Meanwhile, geopolitical events could further complicate global supply issues, especially for oil, as could climate-related developments for food and agricultural products. Our baseline forecast is that inflation will reach an annual average of 2.4% in 2024-28, but risks are tilted to the upside.

The normalisation of trade flows with China will keep a floor under the Australian dollar in 2024, although persistent woes in the Chinese property sector (which pose a risk to demand for Australian iron ore) will keep sentiment bearish. Among domestic factors, moderating inflation and the strength of the labour market (and thus the resilience of private consumption spending) will support the currency in the first half of 2024. The Australian dollar will remain weaker over our forecast period than in the 2010s, owing to its exposure to the structural slowdown in China's economy. However, Australia's strong sovereign rating and outlook will underpin demand for its bonds, ensuring that a major depreciation is unlikely.

The very high global prices for exported commodities that resulted in three enormous merchandise trade surpluses in 2021, 2022 and 2023 are ebbing. The current-account surplus will narrow and then disappear by 2027. Weakening exports to China will serve as a drag on Australia's trade surplus, while dividends to foreign investors will keep the primary income deficit relatively wide. Before that occurs, the existence of a current-account surplus indicates that domestic savings are in excess of local investment; as a result, Australia has become a net exporter of capital. The investment of these excess savings overseas will be led by local superannuation (pension) funds seeking returns on global financial markets.
The goods trade surplus will shrink in 2024, partly because coal prices are coming down from their record highs in 2022-23, and as Chinese demand for iron ore-a key material in steel production-trends downwards amid the crisis in that country's property sector (which will persist in 2024-25). Although demand for iron ore tied to China's automotive and renewable energy sectors will preserve some opportunities for Australian producers, we expect aggregate Chinese demand to fall below the levels it reached in the 2010s.
Inflows of international tourists and students will continue to grow, but will eventually be overtaken by spending by Australian tourists overseas. Dividend payments from local resource firms to non-residents will be the main factor that pushes out the primary income deficit.
Australia will attempt, with mixed success, to reduce its trade reliance on China by pursuing export diversification. An economic agreement with India came into effect in 2022, while efforts to expand trade ties with South-east Asia will persist in 2024-28. Trade negotiations with the EU fell apart in 2023, however, and will not resume until at least 2026, given the election schedules on both sides. The local presence of rare earth minerals and hydrogen resources will grant Australia an opportunity to expand its exports in the future, especially as countries like Japan, the US and those in the EU seek to diversify their EV supply chains based on geopolitical factors.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Australia Stocks and flows Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows slowed to US$31.3bn in 2023, from US$68.7bn in 2022, according to IMF data (on a balance-of-payments basis). Discounting pandemic-era disruptions, this was the lowest value of inbound FDI in more than a decade. However, EIU attributes this to both the high cost of financing and financial arbitrage strategies (tied to the US-Australia interest-rate differential) as a result of aggressive global monetary tightening in 2022-23, rather than reflecting any significant deteriorations in the Australian business environment.
The stock of FDI in Australia stood at US$855.7bn in 2023, equivalent to nearly 50% of annual GDP-a relatively high level. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that the mining sector comfortably accounts for the largest share of the FDI stock, at around one-third of the total, although growth in this category has levelled off in recent years. The strongest expansions in FDI have been in real estate (accounting for 13% of total stock) and financial services (12.6%).
Origin and distribution The composition of the stock of foreign investment in Australia by country of origin has changed gradually. According to the ABS, which counts portfolio investments alongside FDI, the US accounted for 25.1% of total foreign investment stock in 2023, down from 51% in 2004. The UK represents the second-highest amount. However, Asian countries have grown in importance, reflecting the economy's reorientation away from the country's historical Anglo-Saxon allies and towards its Asian neighbours. Japan's share of the FDI stock has grown (it stood at 5.7% in 2023) and China (including Hong Kong) and Singapore have become important sources.
Determinants Australia's open economy, its rich resource endowment and its skilled workforce have made it an attractive destination for foreign investment. Its geographical isolation from other developed economies has also become a less significant deterrent for investors, given Asia's rapid pace of development, although Asian investors themselves occupy a small portion of Australia's FDI stock. The small size of the domestic market means that FDI inflows have traditionally focused on the services sector and on primary-commodity industries, mainly mining. The deregulation, privatisation and opening-up of what was, until the mid-1980s, a tightly regulated protectionist economy stimulated FDI inflows. Investors were willing to tolerate high wage costs to secure access to commodities that are in demand in Asia. The sector will continue to generate investor interest, although slowing Chinese demand for commodities such as iron ore will act as a constraint over the next decade. More promising will be segments such as rare earths and green hydrogen, which will draw attention as agendas linked to green energy transition and supply-chain resilience combine. Global investor interest in property will also remain, although poor housing affordability for Australians also means that some political risk is associated with investment in that sector.
Impact The privatisation of federal and state government businesses provided considerable investment opportunities for local and foreign firms alike in the 1990s. There have been fewer divestments in the past decade, although cross-border mergers and acquisitions continue to have a major impact on FDI inflows. Instead, the mining sector has been the main focus for foreign investors, who provided the capital needed to implement large-scale projects while international prices for commodities were high, and have reduced Australia's exposure to declining mining profits. Such flows will continue to play an important role in boosting the country's capacity to service its high level of foreign debt.
Potential There will be fewer opportunities to take advantage of the privatisation of state-owned firms in the forecast period, with the current Labor Party government less supportive of that agenda. Plans for big investment in transport infrastructure could still result in further asset sales, particularly in the country's most populous state, New South Wales. The mining sector will remain an important destination for FDI, with Australia's mineral wealth and geographical proximity to developing Asian countries supporting inflows into the sector. Australia has untapped potential in green energy sectors, which the federal government is keen to explore, but success in promoting this agenda-alongside related investment opportunities-will vary by state.

The Australian population is expanding relatively quickly, but it is also growing older. These are the most important conclusions to draw from the five-year census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the latest data from which were published in March 2024. EIU believes that the ageing of the population will have important implications for the labour force, where the demand for workers in the healthcare sector is rising rapidly, and for tax policy. Unlike other developed economies in Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, Australia has a favourable demographic profile. We forecast that the total population will reach 27.3m by 2028, an increase by 9.2% from 2018, with the working age population growing by 6.7% over that same ten-year period. This means that the old-age dependency ratio has increased slightly, but not by anywhere near the amounts seen in comparable countries.
Discussions over migration will become increasingly politicised The optimal size of the Australian population occasionally becomes the subject of heated debate. Much of the driver behind the country's population growth reflects a surge in net overseas migration. In the pre-pandemic period, this component provided about 65-70% of the overall increase in population, against 30-45% from the "natural increase" in demographics. Following the pandemic, however, this ratio between migration (which now accounts for 80-85% of the total) and the natural increase (15-20%) has shifted significantly.
Australia's attractiveness as a place to live means that the government has a strong hand in determining the size of the population. At present, a strong economy and a very low level of unemployment means that the government is under pressure to relax its restrictions on inward migration to boost the size of the labour force and fill vacancies. However, such sentiment tends to be very strongly driven by the business cycle rather than long-term ideological views. As such, in the coming decades business groups and labour unions will each advocate for more and less net migration at different stages. The debate over Australia's structural shortage in affordable housing, in particular, has increasingly brought in tighter migration policies as a point of policy discussion. Although we expect Australia to remain one of the best examples of an integrated, multicultural economy that has the power to tweak its immigration policy as best fits demand, we anticipate policymakers on both sides of the political spectrum to adopt a more conservative approach to immigration in our core forecast period (2024-28), given current population dynamics and the current political climate.
At the same time as the population is expanding, it is also ageing. The median age as at June 2023 remained at 38, but we estimate that the proportion of the population aged 65 and above is at 17.1%, from 15.8% five years ago. This trend is already visible in the labour market. Over the past decade the Australian labour force has grown by 20%. Throughout this time the healthcare industry has been the economy's biggest employer, but its headcount has also risen faster than any other, reflecting the demand for services associated with population ageing.
We believe that demographic changes will encourage further adjustments in the retirement age. The age at which people become eligible for the public pension was set at 67 years in July 2023. Successive governments have been aware of the need to keep older employees at work and to prevent a growing number of pensioners from putting a strain on public healthcare and the pension system.
The population will become more ethnically diverse Australia's population will continue to become more ethnically diverse. According to the census, 30.7% of the resident population was born overseas as at June 2023 (nearly half were either born overseas or had one or more parents who were born overseas). Historically, the majority of migrants have come from Europe, but this proportion has fallen gradually. The UK was still the most common place of overseas birth, with India having overtaken China and New Zealand from the previous 2016 census to become the second-most common. Meanwhile, the number of people describing themselves as Aboriginal stood at 3.8% as at June 2023 (using the reference period for June 2021), an increase from 2.8% previously and representing a bigger increase than changing demographics alone can explain. We believe that this most likely reflects a diminished social stigma in claiming an Aboriginal identity.

Competition is limited by market concentration in Australia Australia will remain an attractive and comparatively fast-growing market relative to other economies with a similar level of per-head income, despite its geographical remoteness and fairly small population. The public sector has withdrawn from most areas of the market and almost all industries are open to foreign competition, although foreign investors will face scrutiny. Competition in sectors such as consumer goods and financial and banking services is fierce, but dominated a select number of large incumbents. Examples of high market concentration are most prominent in supermarkets, banking, airlines, telecommunications and electricity. The Labor government has expressed its intention to revamp Australia's competition laws, tackle unfair market concentration and to both broaden and reform the scope of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. However, the limited focus of Labor's initial priorities-namely, on ensuring mandatory notification for mergers and acquisitions-will not unwind the existing market concentration across much of Australia's retail landscape.
Private consumption will remain the backbone of the Australian economy. Consumer spending has recovered strongly from lockdown-related disruption, with households drawing on savings built up over the pandemic to release pent-up demand. Higher inflation and elevated interest rates will dent some of that spending in 2024, but steady growth is likely to resume thereafter as rates drift downwards from late 2024. Although household debt is high in Australia relative to its OECD peers, at more than 200% of net disposable income, elevated rates will not create widespread repayment strains. In addition, a cooling house market will have some negative effects on consumer spending, given that such assets are the primary store of household wealth. Real private consumption growth is expected to average 2% per year in 2024-28. Much of this consumption will be concentrated on services, even as spending on housing and household fuels drives overall consumer expenditure.

Australia's substantial net immigration is focused on young adults with English-language and job skills. However, the number of people aged over 65 will expand steadily, increasing demand for health products and services, household services and suitable accommodation. The generic pharmaceuticals sector is likely to expand rapidly as the government invests in Medicare and provides support to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which heavily subsidises the prices of listed medicines.
High property prices will remain a source of inter-generational inequality Despite cooling slightly in late 2022/early 2023, property prices have risen rapidly in recent decades, more quickly than the pace of wage gains. Housing prices have remained buoyant on the back of higher financing, labour and material costs in recent years. Structural factors, however, are also preventing house prices from cooling; these include high levels of net inward migration (and a resulting surge in dwelling demand), social and political resistance to higher-density residential zoning, as well as policies around negative gearing that have incentivised older, wealthier Australians to use housing stock as an investment vehicle. Consequently, we expect house prices to remain high relative to disposable income over the forecast period, and inequalities are likely to widen between the older generation of homeowners and younger people (as well as between younger people of varying socioeconomic backgrounds) who remain excluded from the housing market. Continued immigration and growth in single-person households will eventually underpin demand for housing and household goods.
These same factors, however, also mean that the wealthiest of the "baby boomer" generation (those now aged 55-70) can look forward to a comfortable retirement. Their affluence will support growth in the market for leisure opportunities, particularly those designed with that demographic group in mind. However, most retirees will remain dependent on the public pension system rather than superannuation (private retirement savings and pensions).

Initial conditions: Australia underwent a series of wide-ranging economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the liberalisation of industrial relations, a sharp reduction in tariff protection, the floating of the exchange rate and the deregulation of the financial sector. Combined with surging commodity prices in the 2000s and a boom in resource investment that meant it experienced only a mild slowdown in the 2008-09 global financial crisis, these reforms underpinned strong economic performance and a rise in the relative standard of living. Although Australia will remain economically liberal, further major reforms in that direction are unlikely with social inequality concerns having risen up the agenda. The Labor Party administration that came to power in May 2022 has pursued more worker-friendly policies, for example, and indicated an end to privatisation. Nearly three decades of Australian GDP growth was broken in 2020, when the economy contracted because of the covid-19 pandemic; however, it experienced a much shallower recession than in most other OECD economies and its subsequent return to expansion was relatively strong. EIU estimates that its GDP per head, in US-dollar terms, was the 13th highest in the world in 2023, while in terms of median household income, Australia rose to fifth place.

Demographic trends: We expect Australia's population to age more slowly than those of many other OECD countries, owing mainly to continued net immigration. This will remain an important support for the economy, and population ageing is likely to be a much less severe policy challenge than elsewhere. We forecast that the working-age population will continue to grow throughout our long-term forecast period (to 2050). Nonetheless, average annual growth in the segment is projected to decelerate from 1.2% in 2011-20 to 0.7% in 2021-30, and then to slow further in 2031-50. As a result, the share of the working-age population will fall from an estimated 64.8% in 2023 to 63.8% by 2030 and to 61.2% by 2050, while the proportion of the population aged 65 or over will continue to rise. Continued high rates of net immigration will lead to Australia's population becoming increasingly diverse and ever more concentrated in its major cities.

External conditions: In coming decades, Australia's comparative advantage will remain in providing the growing economies of China, India and South-east Asia with bulk raw materials. For mining firms, Australia's relative geographical proximity to developing Asian economies gives it an important transport cost advantage over competitors such as Brazil. However, a push by major export markets such as China, Japan and South Korea to introduce climate-friendly policies will weigh on Australia's coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector.

Australia-China ties marred by deep divide between government and business
Despite the ongoing normalisation in Australia-China ties, we expect China to view reducing its own economic reliance on Australian mineral resources as a strategic priority. These considerations reflect persistent Australia-China diplomatic and security tensions, partly as a result of worsening US-China relations, and will remain a periodic source of risk for Australian industry. Many Australian exporters, ranging from mining to agriculture, rely heavily on Chinese demand. Despite a period of relatively successful trade diversification in 2020-23-when China imposed punitive tariffs on Australian goods as part of a wider diplomatic dispute-Australian exporters have rapidly returned to the Chinese market following the easing of Chinese duties in late 2023/early 2024. The speed at which trade ties have rebounded highlights the reluctance of Australian corporates in reducing their exposure to lucrative Chinese demand, even as Australian trade officials cultivate alternative markets elsewhere.

We retain a relatively pessimistic long-term outlook for Australia-China ties until 2050, given the deepening Australia-US relationship, as well as intensifying Australian concerns around Chinese harassment of Taiwan and Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. We view Australia as being disproportionately exposed to any regional conflict, despite its geographic isolation, given its security relationship with the US (which we would expect to be involved in any regional war). These security considerations will ensure periods of volatility in Australia-China diplomatic and trade ties, which Australian policymakers will try to offset by cultivating stronger political and economic ties with other Asian countries, particularly India and South-east Asia. The limited economic potential of these individual markets vis-à-vis China, however, will ensure that a persistent disconnect persists between Australian policy goals-including around economic and trade diversification-and the profit-seeking interests of Australian businesses.

Sustainable growth will depend increasingly on the country's ongoing development as a high-quality regional provider of services. Its location on the edge of Asia will make this a challenge, but it will leverage its ability to draw in migrants from the Asia-Pacific region and to provide an economically and politically stable place for regional companies to do business. Australia's growing economic exposure to Asia will create risks as well as opportunities. As regional power balances shift, Australia could find itself in a confrontational position with China that could undermine its economy. The AUKUS security agreement signed with the US and the UK in 2021 reflected the country's unease with the implications of China's rise and its ramifications for national security. Although the rising global world population will continue to support Australia's agricultural exports, the country will also need to adapt to a changing climate, which will create growing challenges for its agricultural sector with incidence of major flooding already rising. Climate risks will also add to security concerns if they result in large-scale economic migration from poorer neighbourhood economies, notably the Pacific islands.

Institutions and policy trends: Australia will remain a stable democracy, although its complex preferential voting system and federal structure will preserve risks around political gridlock. The country's highly developed financial system, flexible exchange rate and track record of sound macroeconomic management will help the economy to adjust to changes in the global economic environment. Australia will remain an advocate of trade liberalisation, pushing for both multilateral trade pacts and bilateral trade agreements. The continued relative decline of Australia's agricultural and manufacturing sectors will create a political force for protectionism, but we expect its influence to remain limited.

Long-term performance: In future decades Australia will need to increase labour productivity in order to sustain economic growth, as demand for commodities weakens in emerging Asia (especially China). A growing emphasis on higher-value-added services, improvements in human capital, relatively favourable demographics and a renewed focus on the regulatory framework will help to boost productivity in the long term. The main limits to Australia's growth potential stem from its geographic remoteness and continued under-investment in research and development. The country's GDP growth rate is forecast to be relatively resilient, slowing to a trend level of 1.5-2% in 2030-50, from about 2.5% in the 2020s.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Australia is heavily exposed to climate change shocks. Rising sea levels will increase the risk of flooding, while a rise in the sea temperature will pose a threat to the Great Barrier Reef, which is an important ecosystem and source of tourism revenue. There is an increased risk of bushfires, which are already a problem in Australia because of hotter and drier conditions; the Australian Academy of Science has cautioned that the number of "extreme" fire days could double by 2050. Government spending could be subject to upward pressure, as investments are needed to proof the country against rising sea levels and the increased risk of extreme weather conditions.
Policymakers are taking the issue seriously. Australian greenhouse gas emissions fell by 0.5% to 459.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in the period from September 2022 to September 2023 (the latest available data), as estimated by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water. Australia has also resumed to a trend of declining emissions broken by a rise in 2021 when the economy began to reopen from the pandemic. It compares with a peak in emissions of 641.8m tonnes in 2006. However, the country's progress in reducing emissions remains slower than its affluent peers, and it remains one of the world's leading emitters of CO2 on a per head basis, producing 17.3 tonnes of emissions per head in as at September 2023 (higher than the US, most European countries and advanced Asian economies). Power generation in Australia is still heavily dependent on coal, of which the country has large reserves, and is a legacy of policy inaction. The economy's reliance on mining and natural resources has made successive governments reluctant to take tougher regulatory action to curb emissions.
The Labor Party government has adopted a more ambitious climate-change policy, with public awareness of the costs of inaction having widened following increasingly frequent weather events, such as flooding and wild fires. We assess the administration as genuinely committed to Australia's pledges on reducing carbon emissions by at least 43% (from 2005 levels) by 2030, and to achieve carbon net zero by 2050. To do so, Labor has worked with the Australian Greens to pass a climate change bill (in September 2022); update the country's "safeguard" mechanism (first proposed in 2016); and to introduce a "New Zero Economy Authority" (unveiled in May 2024) to mandate work towards the country's clean energy goals, and to co-ordinate public and private investment to support Australia's green transition.
Australia's targets bring it into line with countries such as Canada and Japan. However, its ambitions still fall short of goals set by the likes of the EU, the UK and the US. They are also not consistent with the action required to meet reduction targets set out under the Paris Agreement. The scope to go further will run against concerns about making targets too stringent for business. Labor has, for example, stated that it will not go so far as to impose a moratorium on the approval of new fossil fuel projects. Its announcement in May 2024 of a "Future Gas Strategy" also aims to secure natural gas as part of Australia's energy mix until 2050 (and beyond), showcasing its concerns around the associated costs (including around employment displacement) tied to the net-zero transition.
The limit of these policy actions (and ambitions) will continue to drive consternation among more environmentally-focused segments of Australia's political landscape. The Greens, for instance, have already voiced their concerns with Labor's Future Gas Strategy, to the degree that they have threatened to withdraw support for Labor's agenda in Australia's Senate (the upper house). Still, the climate bills will incentivise investment in green energy and technology, which will strengthen Australia's capacity to manage the impact of climate change.
Technological developments Australia's investment in the National Broadband Network is likely to pay dividends by increasing the country's level of preparedness for advances in the digital economy; this is important, as the country lags behind some other Asia-Pacific countries in terms of internet connectivity. A broader challenge for Australia in terms of technological advancement is relatively low spending on research and development. This was equivalent 1.8% of GDP in 2019 (latest available data from the OECD; ABS estimates business expenditure on research and development, as a percentage of GDP, at 0.9% in 2021-22), well below the OECD ratio of 2.5%, and has been on a declining trend since a peak of 2.2% of GDP in 2008. Australia's economic orientation around resources and commodities hampers the effort to move to a more knowledge-driven, technology-intensive economy. One area in which this manifests itself is low adoption of artificial intelligence by local companies. To bridge this gap, the government is likely to play a greater role in encouraging research and investment in the sector, alongside areas such as cyber-security and defence technology,
Migration and urbanisation Australia is heavily urbanised, with more than 90% of the population living in urban areas, and 70% of the population living in a regional capital. In recent years, Melbourne (Victoria) has been the largest-growing city, in terms of absolute people flows in Australia, although Perth (Western Australia) is the fastest growing city by growth rate. Statistical changes in 2023 have now placed Melbourne as Australia's largest city, followed by Sydney (New South Wales), Brisbane (Queensland), Adelaide (South Australia) and Perth. Sydney remains the prime destination for net overseas migration, recording an inflow of 156,616 people in fiscal year 2022/23. Melbourne, which is home to the most densely populated areas in all of Australia, received 146,772 net overseas migrants over the same period.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.
