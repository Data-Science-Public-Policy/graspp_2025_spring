During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political instability in the coming years, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) trying to distinguish itself from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) having entered the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament).

The ending of Soviet control over central and eastern Europe from 1989, followed by the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than that of other east European countries. The effects of war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-east Europe.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and healthy levels of political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-in particular those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at the EU level. Nineteen EU member states share the euro as their currency. These countries are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank (ECB). They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have often been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. Although the euro zone crisis has passed its peak, normalisation remains a long way off. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during its medium-term forecast period (2018-22). Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster and more successfully with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with mainstream parties will persist in the forecast period. Anti-establishment parties performed well in Italy's general election in March, but political fragmentation means the process of forming a government will be protracted. The next government is likely to be unstable and short-lived.
A government was formed in Germany in March, six months after the election. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political instability in the coming years, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) trying to distinguish itself from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) having entered the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament).
We expect the UK and the EU to negotiate a framework deal on the future trading relationship by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The risk that negotiations will break down is significant.
Vladimir Putin was re-elected as president for a fourth term in March. We expect a greater focus on domestic policy, but even modest liberalising reforms are unlikely. Russia will continue to pursue a muscular foreign policy. We expect EU sanctions on Russia to be maintained and for relations to remain difficult.
Economic policy
We do not expect the EU to undertake the sort of ambitious reforms advocated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, which will meet resistance from some member states, including from Germany, which is wary of EU-level stabilisation instruments that mean an increase in risk sharing.
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will play into the debate on EU reform, hampering progress in this area. Agreement on the budget framework is unlikely until the second half of 2019, after the European Parliament elections in May 2019.
We expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to take a first step towards normalising its main refinancing rate in early 2020, before embarking on a gradual tightening cycle that would bring the interest rate to 1.5% by end-2022.
Economic growth
We forecast average real GDP growth in the EU28 of 1.9% in 2018-22, following estimated growth of 2.5% in 2017.
We expect a real GDP growth slowdown in the UK in 2018-19, to 1.5% per year, owing to Brexit uncertainty. It will pick up in 2019-22.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook: Political stability
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a serious challenge to the future cohesion of the bloc. Despite the professed unity of the other 27 member states, the departure of one of the biggest members is a profound shock that has reverberated and will continue to do so. The EU's management of the Brexit crisis has been further complicated by the weakened position of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, after it took almost six months to form a government following the September 2017 general election. The government is another grand coalition of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The election dealt a blow to the two leading parties, which recorded their worst results since the 1950s, and also brought the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament). The next few years are likely to be a testing time for Germany, with the SPD seeking to distinguish itself from the CDU/CSU and the AfD being a vocal opponent of the government both inside and outside parliament. The March 2018 general election in Italy resulted in a victory for insurgent, anti-establishment parties and a highly fragmented parliament, which will make it almost impossible to form a stable and lasting government. The Catalonia crisis, which escalated in October 2017 after pro-independence citizens voting in an illegal referendum on the region's independence from the rest of Spain encountered state violence, poses another threat to the cohesion of the EU. Nor is the populist challenge to established parties across the bloc likely to dissipate. In addition, escalating tensions with Russia pose a serious geopolitical risk.
There is no room for complacency, as underlying problems remain unresolved
The lesson of the past eight years, since the onset of the euro zone crisis in late 2009, is that politicians have underestimated the economic and political challenges facing the bloc and have prematurely claimed that the worst is over. Threats to the future of the EU, including the sovereign debt crisis, the migration crisis and the populist insurgency, have not been resolved. The existential threat to the euro has certainly lessened since the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-13, when the danger of one of the peripheral economies being forced out of the euro zone, through a loss of investor confidence and a spike in bond yields, weighed heavily on sentiment and investment. The commitment of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the euro has largely neutralised speculative pressure in the bond markets, but the single currency is still vulnerable. Greece is the most obvious cause for concern given its very high public debt/GDP ratio, and The Economist Intelligence Unit thinks it more likely than not that the country will leave the euro zone by the end of the 2018-22 forecast period. Another migration crisis could unfold if the deal between the EU and Turkey were to break down because of a deterioration in relations between the two sides. Most seriously, popular disaffection with the political order in Europe remains substantial, which is likely to fuel support for anti-establishment parties and bring about destabilising political realignments across the continent in the coming years.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has sought to re-energise the Franco-German partnership, and has laid out sweeping plans for EU and euro zone reform. His idea for a euro zone budget and finance minister will face strong resistance in Germany. Plans for greater EU integration in areas such as defence and security have a greater chance of success. Many of Mr Macron's ideas are not new-and some enjoy widespread support in the EU already-but the energy he is putting into championing his vision for Europe marks a sharp change from the more managerial European leadership style of Ms Merkel. The problem is that there is little appetite for some of his bolder ideas in Germany or elsewhere in Europe.
A decision on reform proposals will be made at the EU summit in June 2018. Suggestions put forward by the European Commission in December 2017 included turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)-the euro zone's bail-out fund-into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) that would provide a backstop for the banking union; setting up a fiscal capacity with a stabilisation function for the euro area; and appointing a euro zone economy and finance minister.
We expect some agreement on steps towards completing the banking union and deepening the capital markets union, and expanded powers for the ESM. However progress on reform may be hampered by the outcome of the recent election in Italy, with the formation of the government set to be a protracted process, probably resulting in a coalition that contains one or more parties that are hostile towards Europe. Aspects of the reform plans will meet resistance from some member states, including from Germany, which is wary of EU-level stabilisation instruments that mean an increase in risk sharing. We expect only superficial changes.
Budget negotiations will test EU cohesion
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's next seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will also play into the debate on EU reform, hampering progress in this area. The European Commission has proposed that all member states increase their financial contribution to meet the shortfall in the budget created by the withdrawal of the UK, the fourth-largest contributor. Germany and eight central and east European countries are willing to pay more into the budget, whereas others (including Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark) would prefer to reduce the budget post-Brexit. Agreement on the budget framework is unlikely until the second half of 2019, after the European Parliament elections in May 2019. We expect the Commission to secure larger budget contributions from all EU member states, but achieving this is likely to involve a reallocation (or "modernisation") of funds and will also reflect a shift in the balance of power within the EU post-Brexit, with the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark having lost the UK as an ally.
German election delivers blow to coalition parties
The centre-right CDU, together with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, won the largest vote share in Germany's federal election on September 24th 2017, with 32.9% of the vote. The centre-left SPD scored its worst result in the post-war period, with 20.5% of the vote. The far-right, populist AfD won 12.6%, enough to enter the Bundestag for the first time, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) re-entered the Bundestag, with 10.7% of the vote. The other, smaller parties, the Left Party and The Greens, were also beneficiaries of popular dissat-isfaction with the political mainstream, polling at 9.2% and 8.9% respectively.
The AfD outperformed the polls and did especially well in the former east Germany, where the party became the second-largest political force. Exit polls showed that the issue of migration and refugees was the main reason given for voting for the AfD, with many voters also indicating that this was a protest vote. The CDU and the SPD tried to downplay the issue in the campaign, which goes some way to explaining both the success of the AfD and the drop in vote share for the two large mainstream parties.
A government was finally formed in March 2018, but we expect a more turbulent political scene in Germany in the coming years. Having reluctantly agreed to another grand coalition, the SPD will be keen to distinguish itself from Ms Merkel's CDU. The CDU will also have to start planning for a successor to Ms Merkel. Meanwhile, the AfD will do its best to test the government.
The general election in Italy on March 4th 2018 yielded an acutely fragmented parliament. It also produced a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won about 32% of the vote, and the Eurosceptic anti-immigrant Lega, which won about 17% and overtook the more moderate Forza Italia (FI) led by Silvio Berlusconi to assume the leadership of the centre-right bloc that contested the election. The new parliament convened on March 23rd, and a prolonged period of post-election talks has now started. The possibility of a government that includes M5S and Lega has risen. Political instability risks disrupting Italy's fragile economic recovery.
Few policy changes after the re-election of Mr Putin
On March 18th Vladimir Putin was re-elected to a fourth term as president, securing a record 76.7% of the vote on a turnout of 67%. Mr Putin's re-election was widely expected, given his approval ratings of around 80%, and in the absence of credible opposition candidates. Although the election itself was a non-event, it ushers in a period of political uncertainty as various factions of the elite jockey to secure their position in the coming post-Putin political order-assuming that Mr Putin stands down at the end of his term in 2024. In Mr Putin's fourth term we expect a greater focus on domestic policy, in an effort to arrest falling living standards and bolster growth following the 2015-16 recession. However, even modest liberalising reforms are unlikely and we expect the state to retain its dominant role in the economy. In the foreign policy arena, we believe that Russia will continue to pursue a muscular policy, with the aim of asserting its status as a major player on the global stage. The country's international influence will be strengthened by the conclusion of international business deals in strategic sectors such as oil, nuclear-power plants and military equipment.
Conventional politics upended across the continent
Recent elections across Europe have followed the Italian and German pattern, in that electorates are increasingly favouring alternative or populist parties over the mainstream parties and candidates. The result has been more political fragmentation, protracted negotiations to form a government and the emergence of unusual government coalitions. Elections held in the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Iceland and the Czech Republic in 2017 also illustrated the trend towards increased political fragmentation, as well as a more complicated policymaking outlook.
Spain faces a constitutional crisis over the Catalan question
Another impetus towards the breakdown of post-war political arrangements and fragmentation comes from regional movements demanding more autonomy or independence in countries such as Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and elsewhere, including in eastern Europe. Spain has been plunged into a political crisis by an illegal referendum and unilateral declaration of inde-pendence in Catalonia. The central government responded by using Article 155 of the constitution to dismiss the Catalan government and assume control of the region in late October, and called new regional elections for December 21st.
In the regional election in Catalonia on December 21st 2017, as we forecast, pro-independence parties won a parliamentary majority, with less than 50% of the popular vote. The liberal, pro-unity Ciudadanos (Citizens) topped the poll with 25.4% of the vote. The election confirms the polarisation of views on independence. It produced little numerical change in the balance of power between the electoral blocs of pro-independence and pro-unity parties, despite a turnout above 80%, which the unionists hoped would deliver them victory.
The separatist parties-the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), the centre-right Junts per Catalunya (JuntsxCat; Together for Catalonia) and the anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidates (CUP)-won a combined 47.5% of the vote and 70 seats in the 135-seat parliament, compared with 47.7% and 72 seats in 2015. The three pro-unity parties-Ciudadanos, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) and the conservative People's Party (PP)-won a combined 43.5% and 57 seats, up from 39.2% and 52 in 2015. The non-aligned Catalunya en Comú (the Comuns, associated with Podemos-We Can) polled 7.5% (eight seats).
Ciudadanos is the largest party, with 37 deputies and 25.4% of the vote. Its strong performance came mainly at the expense of the PP, whose support slumped from 8.5% to 4.2%. Ciudadanos will be unable to form a government, but its success in Catalonia is a warning to the two main national parties, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the PP, led by the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Mr Rajoy's mishandling of the Catalan crisis could benefit Ciudadanos at the next general election. The regional election result was in line with our forecast. It represents a major blow for Mr Rajoy, and his government will come under pressure to negotiate with the separatists. Mr Rajoy is unlikely to make concessions, and the conflict is set to continue.
With a number of prominent pro-independence politicians in custody and facing serious charges, ranging from rebellion and sedition to misappropriation of funds, and the former regional president and several other ministers claiming to lead a government in exile in Belgium, the pro-independence movement faces serious challenges in agreeing on the political direction for Catalan separatism. This could take the form of a renewed push for independence or, as is more likely, pressure for a legal referendum, as well as protests over what the pro-independence movement regards as the unjust treatment of its leaders at the hands of the Spanish state.
The Brexit negotiations will test EU cohesion
The Brexit negotiations began in June 2017, after the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29th, beginning the formal two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the bloc. In the Article 50 letter, Theresa May, the prime minister, confirmed that the UK would not seek membership of the EU's single market. This is in line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and budget. The UK will also leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The UK would like to have tariff-free access to EU markets, but customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and would prevent the UK from negotiating trade deals with other countries. The UK will therefore try to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU and has proposed alternatives to customs union membership, including a "highly streamlined" arrangement and a new customs "partnership" that reduce non-tariff barriers to trade such as technical regulations, compliance requirements and rules of origin docu-mentation. We expect the new relationship to be phased in gradually, to minimise disruption. This could mean continued adherence to EU rules for a period after withdrawal.
A deal would be mutually beneficial, but the risk of no deal is high
On March 19th UK and EU negotiators reached agreement on large parts of the draft withdrawal agreement that was published by the European Commission in late February. This includes agreement on the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months after the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU at end-March 2019. EU leaders approved the terms of the transition period at a summit on March 22nd-23rd. There is a risk that a clash between the EU and the UK on the Irish border issue could scupper the withdrawal agreement, but this is not our forecast.
The draft agreement has been colour-coded: areas of the text on which UK and EU negotiators have agreed are in green; areas that need further clarification are highlighted in yellow; and areas in which discussions are continuing are white. The majority of the text is green, reflecting agreement on citizens' rights, the financial settlement, Euratom and on most areas relating to separation provisions (the continued circulation of goods placed on the market and customs procedures). There is also full agreement on the terms of the transition period-the UK will maintain access to the single market, but will be bound by the obligations of membership. UK negotiators have made several concessions that will be unpalatable to Brexiteers within the government: EU law will still be applicable; EU budget contributions will continue; the UK will have no say over fishing quotas; and there will be reciprocal free movement and subsequent entitlement to settled status until the end of the transition. A win for the UK is that it will not be bound by the EU's trade policy, allowing it to agree new trade deals during the transition.
The transition agreement provides businesses with some certainty that they will have time to adjust to the new UK-EU relationship. However, as "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" the transition is conditional on the completion of the withdrawal agreement, and some important parts remain in white. The most critical is the "protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", which in February had established the legal basis of a common regulatory area within Ireland as a fallback option to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, and which the UK had rejected outright. Agreement was reached only on a common travel area within Ireland, and some areas of north-south co-operation.
Political exigencies on both sides reduce the scope for an amicable divorce and the risk that the negotiations will break down is high. If they do, and an extension of the Article 50 deadline is not agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal and revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules. However, both sides have an incentive to agree on a deal, given the mutual benefits of maintaining economic, political and security relations.
Brexit uncertainties have been heightened because of divisions in the government over the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Mrs May's decision to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. The prime minister's authority was badly damaged, but Mrs May will stay in place for now because there is no obvious alternative who could unite both wings of the party. The Conservatives fear another general election given that the momentum is with the main opposition Labour Party. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last the duration of the Brexit negotiations, until March 2019, and there is a significant risk of another pre-term election.
Political outlook: No easy options in Italy
Italy's 2018 general election produced an unprecedented level of political fragmentation. No party or coalition emerged with a majority, and official seat counts suggests that no government can be formed without the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) or the populist Eurosceptic Lega. The process of forming a government will be protracted, and another election cannot be discounted. Whatever coalition is eventually assembled, it is likely to be unstable and short-lived, limiting the scope for reform or even policymaking of any sort.
The centre right is far from having a majority, despite having won the largest vote share, of about 37%. M5S emerged as the biggest single party, with about 33% of the popular vote. Assuming that the current parliamentary groups remain disciplined, the seat counts in the table below suggest that no coherent government can be formed without the support of M5S, the Lega, or both. Given the extreme fragmentation, coalition talks are likely to be long and difficult.

The convening of the new parliament on March 23rd will provide a first procedural signpost for coalition negotiations. First, the formation of parliamentary groups, scheduled for March 25th, could give a sense of which members of parliament (MPs) might be amenable to crossing party lines. Second, the election of the presidents of the two chambers of parliament (the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house; and the Senate, the upper house) may also shed light on emerging alliances.
This process may not be completed until late March or early April, and the president, Sergio Mattarella, will not hold consultations with the leaders of political parties to nominate a prime minister-designate until it is completed. There is no time limit on the president's consultations, which could potentially take weeks. Several possible outcomes are listed below. Regardless of the kind of government that is formed, the administration is likely to be unstable and short-lived.
Centre-right government (low probability)
The centre-right coalition, composed of the Lega, Forza Italia (FI) and the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia, collectively won the biggest vote share and the largest number of seats. It remains unclear to whom Mr Mattarella might give a full or "exploratory" mandate to form a government, although in the past the mandate has typically gone to a prime minister-designate from the winning coalition. This could mean that Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, will be given the first chance to assemble a majority if the mandate does not go to M5S.
Statements from party leaders suggest that the centre-right bloc will remain united for the time being, with Mr Salvini for now ruling out "strange coalitions", understood to mean an agreement with M5S. However, as the table above shows, the centre right would have to fill a sizeable deficit of seats to reach a majority, particularly in the Chamber of Deputies. Unless the Partito Democratico (PD) and M5S parliamentary groups splinter, it is unclear where sufficient support would be found. It also remains to be seen whether Mr Salvini, a caustic and polarising figure, would be successful in attracting breakaway MPs from the more moderate formations.
M5S-Lega government (medium probability)
Before the election there was speculation that if M5S passed the threshold of 30% of the vote and the Lega topped FI, the Lega and M5S might conclude a government pact. Having satisfied both of these conditions, M5S and the Lega would have a majority in both parliamentary houses, and a comfortable one if Fratelli d'Italia is included. Despite ideological differences, they share common ground in their criticism of the EU (albeit to differing degrees, as M5S has shifted towards the centre and the Lega further to the right), opposition to recent labour and pension reforms, calls for tax cuts and welfare spending to support low earners, and a desire for tougher immigration and security policies.
The strong performance of Mr Salvini's party means that he should have been given a relatively free hand by Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of FI, who has long dominated the centre right, to negotiate with other parties. However, we believe that Mr Salvini would prefer a role as leader of the centre right to one as junior coalition partner to M5S. Moreover, doing a deal with M5S could risk alienating a significant portion of the Lega's rural, conservative base in the north. Mr Salvini will also be concerned that support for his party could dissipate in government if the inexperienced M5S makes a mess of policy. Arguably, he stands to do even better at the next election if an M5S-led government proves to be ineffectual and short-lived.
At the same time, M5S may be reluctant to do a deal with the Lega, at least in the early stages of negotiations. Luigi Di Maio, M5S's prime ministerial candidate, has signalled a strong desire to govern, proposing a group of ministers before the election and saying he was open to negotiations with other parties after the vote-something that M5S had previously eschewed. However, like Mr Salvini, Mr Di Maio will also be constrained by his base. Although M5S has moved steadily towards the centre, its roots lie on the political left, and much of its younger, progressive core could desert it if it formed a coalition with the Lega. The same may be true of many of M5S's southern supporters, who regard the Lega with distrust.
If M5S-Lega talks fail: M5S-PD government (medium probability)
Having previously rejected the PD's overtures to support a centre-left government after the 2013 general election, M5S has now declared its willingness to have discussions with all parties on the left, as well as the right, about forming the next government. The party leadership would reportedly prefer a coalition with the left (including the PD and Liberi e Uguali) to one with the Lega (conditional on the resignation of the PD's leader, Matteo Renzi). On March 5th Mr Renzi said that the PD was going into opposition in the next parliament and that he would resign as party leader, but only after the government formation process was over. This caused severe tensions within the PD. On March 12th, when the national executive of the PD met to put in place a new, temporary leadership, Mr Renzi's resignation took immediate effect. This will give the new PD leadership greater flexibility later in the government formation process. The party's interim leader, Maurizio Martina, has promised that he will manage the party collegially, which will mean that the views of Mr Renzi's opponents in the PD, some of whom advocate talks with M5S, will have to be taken into account. Initially, the PD will leave the onus of trying to form a government to M5S and the centre right led by the Lega. However, if other options fail and a rerun of the election appears imminent and investors start to get nervous, we expect that the PD and the wider left will re-enter the process at a later stage.
President's government (low probability)
Party cohesion tends to be weak in Italy, and parliamentary rules make it relatively easy to change parliamentary group. Almost 600 MPs out of a total of 945 changed groups at least once in the 2013-18 term. Prolonged inconclusive negotiations on forming a government would be likely to cause strains in M5S and between the parties on the centre right and the centre left. This could lead to the breakdown of party discipline and a fracturing of the parliamentary blocs that have emerged from the election, opening up new coalition options and making possible some form of broad coalition. However, at present such an arrangement would appear to be numerically difficult.
A major cause for concern for MPs that might persuade them to converge on a government programme would be the high cost of getting elected and the need to establish tenure to gain parliamentary pension rights. The president's insistence, and possibly volatility in financial markets, could be additional push factors. Such a government would be likely to have a limited policy remit.
Rerun election (low to medium probability)
The level of political fragmentation is such that the risk of a new election has risen. In the past political parties have generally found a compromise to break political deadlock after a messy election or government crisis. Mr Mattarella would probably be reluctant to call for a rerun vote, which would be likely to yield a similar outcome. However, if parties cling stubbornly to their red lines and the parliamentary groups remain mostly intact, a new vote may become unavoidable. There has been some speculation about the formation of a short-term administration to reform the voting law before a new election is held. If political parties remain deeply divided, an agreement on electoral reform seems highly improbable.
However, when faced with the possibility of a fresh election under the same voting rules, and the financial volatility that might accompany it, we believe that it is likely that a combination of M5S, the PD, FI and several small centrist groups would agree to form a government.
Political outlook: Election watch
We expect political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period. In the euro zone, in particular, the negative political fallout from the financial crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the post-war political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that fragmentation and difficulties forming a government occur even in countries that are registering solid rates of growth, such as Ireland, and in traditionally politically stable countries, such as the UK.
Fine Gael minority coalition government will not survive full term
The collapse of Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland was narrowly averted in late November 2017. Our view remains that the government does not have the capacity or cohesion to address effectively the mounting economic and political challenges facing Ireland. As a result, we continue to believe that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021 and that a snap election will take place in the second half of 2018 or in early 2019. The timing is complicated by the planned referendum on abortion, which is likely to be held in late May. The topic is divisive; barring another government crisis, Mr Varadkar may choose to wait before calling a general election if the referendum campaign or the outcome of the vote were to damage his party's support, which cannot be ruled out.
Given voter disillusionment with the three established parties-Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Labour Party-we expect the next election to be incon-clusive, as in February 2016. Another such outcome would put greater pressure on Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to set aside their historical differences and form a grand coalition.
At the 2016 general election none of the established parties was willing to contemplate entering a coalition with the nationalist Sinn Fein party led by Gerry Adams, which had links to the now disbanded Irish Republican Army (IRA). We think that this is unlikely to change after the next election, but a transition is now under way in the party. The leadership has passed to Mary Lou McDonald, one of Sinn Fein's younger members, who is not associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.
In Spain political dysfunction has been pronounced. At end-October 2016, following an inconclusive general election in December 2015 and a rerun ballot six months later, parliament elected Mr Rajoy, the leader of the PP, as prime minister for a second term. However, Mr Rajoy's PP minority government is one of the weakest in Spain's democratic history, and we do not expect it to serve a full four-year term. It relies on just 170 votes-those of the PP, Ciudadanos and the Canary Island Coalition (CC)-in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies (the lower house of parliament). With Ciudadanos now topping the polls as the largest party, pressure is mounting on Mr Rajoy.
The parliamentary term ends in June 2020, but an early election is likely to be held in 2018 or 2019. The Catalonia crisis represents another threat to government stability. Over the medium term Spanish politics will remain fluid, with scant prospects for major political or economic reforms until a stronger administration enters office.
The next parliamentary and presidential elections in Turkey are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given Mr Erdogan's popularity, and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect him to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. The president's popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him.

Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
East-West political tensions are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia is slowly dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place in at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and its breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Western countries have accused Russia of funding opposition parties in western Europe and employing cyber warfare against Western targets, as well as engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West.
Russia-West tensions intensified when a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on March 4th, having been attacked with a rare nerve agent in the UK city of Salisbury. Little is known at this stage about the circumstances surrounding the attack, which also affected the first police officer who arrived at the scene. All three are in a critical condition in hospital. The UK government accused the Russian state of being behind the attack, citing a previous assassination in 2006 when polonium, a radioactive agent, was used to murder Alexander Litvinenko, a former member of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB, the Russian domestic intelligence service), in London. The UK government, and in particular Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, used strong language in their condemnation of Russia. Russian diplomats and officials made the most of the hostile UK response and the ratcheting up of tensions to mobilise support for Mr Putin, who stood for election for a fourth presidential term on March 18th. Despite the tough talk from the UK, so far the measures taken, including the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomatic staff from the embassy in London, have been rather modest. Should a Russian connection be established, especially in view of the method used, which potentially endangered many civilians, UK-Russia relations would worsen further and there would be pressure on the UK to respond more decisively.
Tensions with Russia are unlikely to abate
Russia has said that the EU and the US are interfering in its sphere of influence, supporting the so-called "Colour Revolutions" in former Soviet space. Russia has accused NATO of going back on its post-cold war commitments by expanding relentlessly, first taking in central Europe and the Baltic republics, then Albania and Croatia in 2009 and, most recently, Montenegro in June 2017. Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH), Macedonia and Georgia are now in the waiting room for admission. The Iraq War and Colour Revolutions fuelled Russian insecurity and convinced Russia that the US wanted "regime change" in the country, and possibly the break-up of the Russian Federation. In the face of such an existen-tial threat, from the Kremlin's perspective any countermeasures are justified.
In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and has since been providing military support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. The EU imposed sanctions on Russia's energy, defence and banking sectors in July 2014 following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The sanctions are subject to regular renewal, requiring the approval of all 28 EU member states.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, seems likely to endure for several years. This will serve Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict will prevent any Ukrainian move towards the EU.
Russia will remain vehemently opposed to EU and NATO integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via a popular uprising similar to the Ukrainian Maidan revolution in 2014, would trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
We do not expect political or economic upheaval in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region in 2018. The exceptions to this outlook are Uzbekistan, where the new president will continue pursuing a reformist course, and Armenia and Georgia, which will hold presidential elections this year and outpace most of the region in terms of economic growth. In Kazakhstan uncertainty will increase regarding the succession of the long-time president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the launch of the Astana International Finance Centre (AIFC) will not be an investment game-changer. We believe that no significant political or economic change will take place in the other central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan). The vulnerability of several countries, including Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, to political and social instability will remain high.
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt a breakdown in inter-governmental relations has fallen sharply over the past year, as economic growth has picked up across the bloc. The ECB has successfully overcome objections in a number of countries-notably in Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing has, up to now, not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
The rise of anti-establishment political sentiment across much of the bloc has generated increased pressure for economic policymaking that is focused on national considerations rather than on the integrity of the euro zone, creating new centrifugal forces at a time when policymakers are already struggling to remedy the institutional shortcomings of the single currency. Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. This should ensure its survival in the short term, but the risk of a partial break-up in the medium term remains significant. We attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro area during our five-year forecast period.
The refugee relocation policy will be a bone of contention in the EU
The issue of refugee relocation is a focal point for existing tensions between integration-minded countries of west Europe and a core of central European countries. In September 2015 the European Council established a temporary scheme to relocate across the EU some of the Syrian refugees who had arrived in Italy and Greece, with the aim of sharing the burden of accommodating them. This was particularly controversial in central and eastern Europe, where governments characterised it as an attempt by western Europe to export the consequences of misguided foreign policies, and said that it raised the prospect of terrorist attacks as a result of Islamist infiltration. Public opposition to the scheme has been substantial across the region.
Tension between Turkey and the EU will remain high
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. This would almost certainly prompt the country to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period.
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have pursued contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Mr Erdogan's state visit to Greece on December 7th-8th 2017-the first such visit by a Turkish president in 65 years-was a tense affair. Greater co-operation on issues such as trade and security may result, but points of contention will continue to fuel distrust. Historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea or more recent events, such as the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the failed coup in Turkey in July 2016, and the arrest and imprisonment of Greek soldiers who strayed over the Turkish border on March 1st 2018, will continue to be flashpoints. We expect relations to remain tense, with sporadic flare-ups, but we do not expect an outbreak of conflict.
Economic policy
Euro zone reform efforts are being stepped up
The threat of a euro zone break-up has receded in recent years as the region's economic recovery has strengthened and broadened, and as its institutional underpinnings have become more resilient. The commitment in July 2012 by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to "do whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning point for the bloc, the resilience of which to shocks has also been bolstered by the establishment of an EU banking union and a permanent rescue fund. EU leaders are currently making a renewed push for further integration of the economic and monetary union. Proposals put forward by the European Commission on December 6th 2017 included turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)-the euro zone's bail-out fund-into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) that would provide a backstop for the banking union; a stabilisation function for the euro area, which would deal with asymmetric shocks by providing resources to support investment at the national level; and a euro zone economy and finance minister who would oversee the EMF and serve as vice-president of the European Commission.
Some aspects of these plans will meet internal resistance and will struggle to get off the ground. In The Economist Intelligence Unit's view, strengthening the existing structures would be helpful, but such proposals are not necessary for the region's economic recovery to continue in the coming years. EU leaders will present reform proposals at a summit in June 2018.
The UK's departure from the EU will encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infra-structure. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and develop-ment over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. There will also be a new effort to improve vocational skills. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are still too modest in size and scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.

Data based on national definitions.
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely heavily on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This created a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where we expect further tightening in 2018-19. Although we continue to expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in most countries, we now expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive during our five-year forecast period (2018-22).
We expect fiscal consolidation to exert a much less powerful drag on growth in 2018-22 compared with the preceding five years. Almost all European countries improved their fiscal positions in 2009-16 (2017 data are not yet available), with the star performers being Iceland (by 25.6 percentage points of GDP), Greece (15.6), Ireland (13.1) and Lithuania (9.4). In the EU only Spain and France had deficits larger than the EU's 3% of GDP limit in 2016 (4.5% and 3.4% respectively). Although we expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis. The average EU government debt/GDP ratio was 85.4% at end-2016, but Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal had debt ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the euro zone for many years. Although the cost of debt servicing has fallen dramatically in recent years owing to the exceptionally low interest rates that currently prevail across the bloc, borrowing costs are set to rise gradually as monetary policy is normalised.
The UK government is targeting steady deficit reduction
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016-17, and we expect this improvement to be maintained in 2018-22, despite a fiscal loosening in the November 2017 autumn budget. We forecast that the deficit will stabilise at about 3% of GDP in 2018, after averaging 2.9% in 2016-17, as the government eases off its austerity drive. However, in the remainder of our forecast period the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to narrow to 1.9% of GDP by 2021 and 1.6% by 2022. The public debt burden stood at 88.2% of GDP in 2016. We forecast that public debt will peak at just below 89% of GDP in 2018, before falling thereafter.
Within the EU, over the past two years a number of national governments have shown signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. In 2016 tensions between several member states and the European Commission, which enforces the EU's budgetary rules, came to a head. In early July 2016 the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should be fined for their failure to meet deficit targets in 2015, but the Commission ultimately stepped back from this position. The episode highlighted the growing tension between the strict fiscal rules agreed at the height of the crisis and the mounting political and economic arguments within member states for a greater degree of fiscal flexibility.
The Russian government faces tight budget constraints as a result of low commodity prices. However, despite international sanctions and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances, Russia placed two oversubscribed Eurobonds in June 2017, followed by two more in March 2018. The budget deficit narrowed sharply in 2017, to 1.4% of GDP (from 3.4% of GDP in 2016), on the back of higher average oil prices. We expect the Ministry of Finance to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-22, but the adjustment to expenditure is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly in the short term, given the recent social spending promises of the president, Vladimir Putin. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms in 2018-19 as projected, although spending will still decline in real terms, and plans to reduce defence spending have been announced. Under the three-year budget outlook the finance ministry aims to cut the deficit as a share of GDP to 1.6% in 2018, 0.9% in 2019 and 0.8% in 2020, in line with our projections of annual budget deficits of less than 1% of GDP in 2019-22.

Despite the healthy economic outlook across the region, an absence of corresponding inflationary pressure means that the ECB will keep monetary policy accommodative this year. Policy interest rates will remain below zero and an asset purchase programme (APP) will run at EUR30bn (US$37bn) per month until September. In March 2018 the ECB dropped a sentence from its policy statement that had demonstrated its willingness to expand the APP if the outlook worsened. This implies that the bank is preparing to cease monthly net asset purchases under the APP, reinforcing our view that they will be reduced in the fourth quarter of 2018, before coming to an end.
The ECB and regional central banks are moving towards policy normalisation
Rising commodity prices and evidence of domestic price pressure should mean that sufficient inflation will begin to emerge in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take a first step towards normalising its main refinancing rate in early 2020, before embarking on a gradual tightening cycle that brings it to 1.5% by end-2022. The next increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability. We expect the ECB to maintain its stock of assets, which we expect to total close to EUR2.6trn (US$3.2trn), throughout the forecast period.
Anticipating a build-up of inflationary pressures, other central banks across the region have started, or are preparing, steps towards policy normalisation. The Bank of England (BoE, the UK's central bank) and the Czech National Bank (CNB, the Czech central bank) both raised their main policy rate in late 2017, and are expected to follow up with at least one more rate increase this year. Meanwhile, we expect rate rises from Norges Bank (Norway's central bank) and the Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) in late 2018. The Swiss National Bank (SNB, Switzerland's central bank) is likely to reduce its foreign-exchange interventions in 2018, and to lift its policy interest rate by a small amount in 2019.
The BoE is keen to normalise monetary policy
The UK economy has been sufficiently resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote for its central bank to increase the main policy interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017, the first rate rise in a decade. In March 2018 the BoE voted to keep policy unchanged, although two of its nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points, to 0.75%. The MPC is keen to begin normalising its policy rate and most members agree that a further tightening will take place at some point this year. Revised forecasts from the BoE at the time of the February meeting showed stronger economic growth prospects over the next few years, with real GDP growth set to average 1.7% in 2018-20-above consensus estimates. Survey-based indicators suggest that preliminary GDP data for the first quarter of 2018 will confirm a picture of firm activity when they are released on April 27th, setting the stage for a majority vote in favour of a small rate increase in May, or at the time of the next quarterly inflation report, in August. We maintain our view that this will be followed by a gradual tightening cycle.
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. Under political pressure to not raise interest rates further, especially ahead of the 2019 elections, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. In the event of another severe weakening of the lira, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary. However, this is not our baseline scenario.
In Russia the fall in oil prices, which led to a significant contraction in real GDP and household consumption in 2015-16, has underlined the imperative for reforms to encourage investment and diversification away from commodity exports. However, we do not expect significant reforms to be undertaken during Mr Putin's fourth term, and the Russian president will continue to prioritise social and political stability. We expect state involvement in the economy to remain substantial. In his March 1st state of the nation speech, Mr Putin set out some of his socioeconomic goals for his next presidential term. His agenda appeared to include fragments of competing policy agendas proposed by Aleksei Kudrin, a former finance minister, and the Stolypin Club, an economic research group led by a business ombudsman, Boris Titov. The Kudrin camp emphasises the need to reduce the role of the state in the economy and to increase competitiveness and productivity by investing in human capital, in contrast to the Stolypin Club's call for a more statist and Keynesian policy agenda. Reform of the tax system and a gradual rise in the pension age appear likely. Institutional reform to strengthen the rule of law and protection for businesses looks much more difficult to achieve.
Policy to be kept tight to support the Turkish lira and lower inflation
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and on a generally depreciating path against all major currencies since mid-2013, when the prospect of a gradual reduction in ultra-loose global liquidity and an eventual tightening of policy took shape. After a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow during the forecast period, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. There are substantial risks to this forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region. We expect the lira to average TL4.26:US1 in 2022, compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017.
Inflationary pressures have continued to weaken in Russia in 2017
Russia has seen steady consumer price disinflation since late 2015, with inflation hitting a record low of 2.2% year on year in February 2018, well below the CBR's 4% inflation target. Disinflation has been assisted by record harvests in 2016-17, as well as the relative strength of the rouble (against the US dollar and the euro). We expect inflation to pick up in the second half of 2018, reaching the 4% target near the end of the year as the CBR loosens policy, the rouble depreciates modestly against the dollar and consumer demand increases. In 2019-22 we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-the 4% target (very low levels by Russian historical standards). In 2018 a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) and the possible imposition of new US sanctions will lead to a modest depreciation of the rouble against the dollar, to an average of Rb60.6:US$1. We forecast an overall slight nominal appreciation in 2019-22 owing to increasing oil prices, although a downturn in the US business cycle will lower oil prices slightly and weaken the rouble in 2020. The rouble is correlated with oil prices, so any rapid fall in oil prices could lead to renewed volatility.
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of tightening by the Fed. However, we do not see significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of a strong tourism performance have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2018.
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which have hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan both officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, the commitment of both countries to a free float would be seriously tested in the event of further oil price volatility. We would expect the central banks of both countries to intervene-at least temporarily-in such a scenario to prevent sharp fluctuations in the currency and to maintain financial and monetary stability.

Average annual real GDP growth in the UK was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017, from 2.1% in January-March to 1.5% in October-December. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a further modest growth slowdown in the next two years, to 1.5% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019, led by a slowdown in domestic demand. A looser fiscal stance will provide some positive support to real GDP growth throughout the 2018-22 forecast period, but consumer spending will weaken in response to the squeeze on household disposable incomes from falling real wages. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a sharp drawdown of savings. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened uncertainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, and the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. The export boost will ease in 2019, after which we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.8% on average in 2020-22.
The economic impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU on the wider regional economy could be substantial. In addition to the direct effect via trade and investment channels, over time the referendum result is also likely to compound centrifugal political and institutional dynamics in the EU and the euro zone. However, the short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe as a whole.

The euro zone recovery has gathered pace
The outlook for the European economy has improved greatly. Real GDP growth gained momentum in 2017 as the recovery that had been building since 2013 became more broad based. We expect EU28 growth to accelerate this year, from 1.9% in 2016 to 2.4%, before slowing to an annual average of 1.8% in 2018-22. Virtually all euro zone member states have registered firmer rates of expansion, and although country-level disparities persist, the region's recovery is looking healthier. In our view the economic recovery has further to run, partly because it is rooted in factors that will underpin sustainable demand, such as rising employment and household deleveraging. Furthermore, there remains significant slack in the euro zone economy that has yet to be absorbed.
We expect growth in the euro zone to moderate this year, from 2.5% in 2017 to 2.2%, before slowing to an annual average of 1.8% in 2019-22. The upswing in the euro zone and the broader EU mitigates the risk to the region's economic prospects from external factors, notably monetary policy tightening in the US and an expected slowdown in China.
Nevertheless, the longer-term outlook for the single currency area will remain challenging. Demographic factors will begin to exert a more powerful drag on an increasing number of countries in the bloc. We do not expect policymakers to find solutions to some of the euro zone's institutional shortcomings. In particular, they are unlikely to reform the bloc's fiscal policy framework. This means that tensions will persist between member states over targets for budget deficits.
In Germany the domestic demand-driven pick-up in real GDP growth accelerated in 2017, bringing headline growth to 2.5%. We forecast 2.4% growth in 2018, with the rate of economic expansion easing gradually thereafter, to 1.7% on average in 2019-22. Growth will be slower in France (owing to structural rigidities in the tax system and the labour market) and Italy (reflecting a weak demographic profile, political instability and a slow pace of reform).
In southern Europe, the economic recovery on the Iberian peninsula may have peaked in 2017. After real GDP growth of 3% in Spain in 2017, we forecast average growth of 2.2% in 2018-22. Portugal recorded real GDP growth of2.7% in 2017, and we forecast an expansion of 2.3% this year and 1.7% on average in 2019-22. Meanwhile, Greece will exit its third bail-out programme this year, but we are sceptical that the country will experience rapid growth. The Greek economy returned to growth in 2017 and should experience a modest rebound in 2018-22. The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but is losing momentum and will slow in 2018-19 as economic uncertainty weighs on spending and investment, before recovering gradually.
The Visegrad countries can look forward to above-average growth rates
Much of central and eastern Europe also faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding in particular will see real GDP growth well above the EU average in 2018-22. A deadline at the end of 2015 for fund drawdowns from the EU's 2007-13 fiscal period brought an end to a surge in investment spending. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to begin in 2016, holding back activity last year, but funds began to flow again in 2017 and projects are under way that will lift economic growth rates during the forecast period. We expect that growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-will remain solid. The German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Economic activity is picking up in south-east Europe
In south-east Europe the situation is generally improving after a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery. We expect continued strong real GDP growth in the region's biggest economy, Romania, which grew by 7% in 2017, of 5.5% in 2018 and of 3.7% per year in 2019-22. However, rapid wage growth is driving a consumer boom that is sucking in imports and inflating the current-account deficit, and tax cuts have widened the fiscal deficit. Bulgaria will also maintain the momentum established in 2015-17. In 2018-22 we expect real GDP growth to average 3%. This sustained pick-up is driven by improved performance in the euro zone, robust export performance and increased expenditure on infrastru-cture projects, which received a boost from a surge in the inflow of EU funds.
Growth in the western Balkans to accelerate; Baltics and Visegrad to slow
Economic activity in the western Balkans has picked up in the past three years, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices. In 2015-16 private investment and exports were the main drivers of growth in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, with private consumption remaining weak, pointing to a more balanced growth trajectory. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the global economic crisis in 2007-09, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some notable exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the western Balkans should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. We do not think that the fallout from the Brexit vote will be unduly negative for the Balkans, whose slow progress towards EU membership is set to continue.
We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina-BiH-Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) of about 3.2% in 2018. Growth in the three Baltic states is estimated at 4.3% in 2017 and we expect it to average 3.4% per year in 2018-19.
Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter during this period, government consumption also by nearly a quarter, house-hold consumption by a fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery that got under way in 2017 is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. We estimate that real GDP will expand by 1.9% per year on average in 2018-22, following growth of 1.3% in 2017.
In Turkey domestic political instability, the perceived risk of terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook weighed on the economy in 2015-16, but relative stability following the April 2017 presidential reform referendum and fiscal stimulus measures have supported a rebound to estimated growth of 7% in 2017. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of 4.1% in 2018-22, reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates and a gradual tightening of global liquidity. The main downside risk is that further political instability stemming from the transition to a presidential system of government could deter foreign capital inflows. Upside risk stems from government plans to extend stimulus measures, but this could also result in a larger than expected fiscal deficit.
Russia's economy has moved into a recovery phase
According to a first estimate by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), real GDP in Russia grew by 1.5% in 2017, up from a contraction of 0.2% in 2016. The return to growth was mainly driven by private consumption and, to a lesser extent, by fixed investment. In 2018 we expect the factors supportive of private consumption to persist, with inflation low and the rouble relatively stable. As indicated in the March state of the nation address given by Vladimir Putin, the president, government spending on wages and pensions should pick up this year. Economic stabilisation and a higher average oil price are supportive of a rise in gross fixed capital formation, but international sanctions, the lack of a "culture of failure", and broader political and business uncertainty will remain significant constraints. We expect import growth to slow, lessening the negative contribution from the external balance. Overall, this points to a slight increase in real GDP growth, to 1.7% in 2018. In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, subdued investment levels, a weak financial sector, international sanctions, low productivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that growth will average 1.7% per year in 2018-22, mainly driven by private consumption and, to a lesser extent, fixed investment, as in 2017.
The possible end of Russian gas transit in 2019 represents a big risk
Real GDP fell by a cumulative 16.4% in Ukraine in 2014-15 amid conflict and a chaotic political situation. The disruption of these years accentuated a structural change in the Ukrainian economy away from heavy industry and towards agriculture. The economy recovered in 2016, driven by vigorous growth in private invest-ment, alongside a recovery in private consumption. We estimate that real GDP grew by 2.2% in 2017, given better external conditions, increased social spending (boosting consumption) and a solid recovery in investment (domestically funded). In 2018 we expect real GDP growth to rebound, to 3%, and in 2019-22 we expect growth to average 2.6%, led by household consumption. The possible end of Russian gas transit in 2019-when the current transit contract expires and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to the EU through the Baltic Sea is supposed to begin operations-represents a risk.
Growth and exchange-rate movements in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region are highly correlated to movements in global oil prices, especially in large oil exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Owing to important trade links and high levels of remittance flows, the performance of the Russian economy has a direct impact on that of smaller CIS countries in Central Asia (the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) and the South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia, not CIS members). We forecast growth of 1.7% in Russia, 1.6% in Azerbaijan, 3.2% in Kazakhstan and 3% in Ukraine in 2018. Given our forecast for a broadly stable oil price of around US$60/barrel in 2018-22, barring other major developments the growth outlook for most countries is unlikely to change significantly from this year's final outturn.

The slump in global oil prices in late 2014 exacerbated a marked disinflationary trend in Europe, but helped to boost the region's real economy in 2015, and to a limited extent in 2016, as households benefited from higher real earnings and businesses from lower input costs. Since late 2016 inflation has picked up, with base effects-notably those related to energy prices-providing much of the initial impetus in early 2017. As base effects have fallen out of the arithmetic, inflation has stabilised again. We expect it to average 1.7% in the EU28 in 2018 and 1.9% per year in 2019-22.
In a number of specific instances across the region, very different inflationary patterns will be recorded-Turkey, for example, will struggle throughout the forecast period to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% official target. Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high, as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. Assuming that the Central Bank of Turkey keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it again too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2022.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of ten categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into ten categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair, although patchy, have, in most countries, been under way for some time. Western Europe's score remains broadly stable, rising from 7.46 in the historical period to 7.67 in the forecast period, and eastern Europe's score moves up from 6.07 to 6.50 over the same timeframe. Across the region, the strongest ranking improvements are recorded by Denmark, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus. By contrast, Turkey drops by ten places, Switzerland by six, and Greece and Ireland by four. Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America (8.21), and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe and Asia and Australasia (6.79), but performs above Latin America (5.74), and the Middle East and Africa (5.62).
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets, and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Recent years have brought considerable improvement to the investment climate of central and eastern Europe. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even here. Factors such as a low-cost but well-qualified labour force, proximity to developed markets and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region during the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. In Russia the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. Low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to attempt to open up and diversify their economies. Ukraine has committed itself to an ambitious reform programme; however, its economic prospects will be harmed by disruption of trade and financial ties with Russia. Throughout the region the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power following the installation of a Constituent Assembly in 2017 and rigged presidential elections this coming May, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in office beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations or boosts dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, GDP contraction and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making it one of the least attractive investment locations in the world. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policies, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. This approach has created large distortions , with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the past oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme (although this is winding down), the country is running short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$16.5bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account deficit at 0.4% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Even as Venezuela's severe economic woes deepen amid an intensifying debt crisis and hyperinflation, the governing Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has strengthened its hold on power while the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has slid into disarray. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition process, most likely ushering the MUD into power in 2019.
The president, Nicolás Maduro, is poised to be re-elected on May 20th in fraudulent elections. Administrative obstacles have disfranchised opposition parties, including the MUD itself, and most of the opposition is boycotting the election. The PSUV controls almost all subnational governments, has outsized influence on the judiciary and has created its own de facto legislature by instituting, in 2017, the PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) to supplant the MUD-controlled National Assembly. Although economic conditions in the country continue to deteriorate, sparking protests and violence, the MUD has little chance of effecting change by itself. The PSUV's continued hold on power and the MUD's historical penchant for infighting has meant that the MUD's own base has become increasingly demoralised and demobilised.
The PSUV's permanence in power hinges on continued support of three key backers: the state's coercive apparatus (the security forces and military); a sizeable sector of the population dependent on government handouts; and the so-called colectivos, activist groups that are a cross between community organisers and PSUV paramilitaries. The key backer is the military, which controls most of the ministries related to management of the economy and security. This includes-since November-the Ministry of Oil and PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The government plies these groups with resources, with the vast majority coming from PDVSA. We believe that a prolonged interruption in exports by PDVSA would destabilise this patronage system and hence undermine the regime's base of support.
We see three main paths towards such interruption. The first two paths involve the curtailment of trade with the US, from where PDVSA obtains most of its hard-currency earnings through exports while also importing vital production inputs. In the short term, it would be logistically impossible to replace the US as a trading partner. The most immediate way in which access to the US market would be denied is by the imposition of sanctions on the oil trade by the US government. Despite threats, American authorities have so far not introduced such sanctions, perhaps mindful of internal socio-economic costs, as Venezuelan oil is refined and distributed in the US by Citgo, a PDSVA subsidiary. A similar curtailment of trade with the US may take place owing to asset seizures stemming from legal action by the holders of the bonds on which the government and PDVSA are in arrears. Although seizures could potentially take place in any jurisdiction, seizures in the US, including of Citgo assets, would be the most immediate and damaging. However, no such legal action has yet been taken and the timing of potential seizures is uncertain. The third path towards a destabilising reduction in foreign-exchange earnings is related to PDVSA's falling output due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Oil output has fallen by over 20% since Mr Maduro took office, and we expect production to continue dropping, dragging with it PDVSA's foreign-exchange earnings. Politically motivated investment from Russia and China, once abundant, seems unlikely to return in enough volumes to prop up production.
Although we expect further concessions to the military in 2018, we expect that the declining oil output will put the government's patronage system at risk by late 2018 or early 2019. What happens next is difficult to predict, especially in the light of the close relationship between military leaders and PSUV civilians. An outright military government is a possibility. An internal re-organisation of the regime, whereby the military takes on increased powers while maintaining civilian figureheads, Mr Maduro included, is also possible. However, we continue to believe that the profound economic crisis and desperate humanitarian situation will fuel a combination of social upheaval and concerns regarding the loyalty of the military's lower ranks that will force the military's hand, prompting it to remove Mr Maduro from power, accept foreign humanitarian aid and call for elections.
Regardless of how and when political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. In addition to having to contend with holdovers in the colectivos, the military and every branch of the state, the opposition will have to confront huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
On March 1st the National Electoral Council agreed to postpone the presidential elections scheduled for April 22nd to May 20th, while also expanding them to include municipal and state legislatures. Owing to administrative chicanery, the majority of the opposition parties, including the MUD, are either banned or are boycotting the election. The only opposition politician of national relevance participating is Henri Falcón, a former member of the PSUV, who now heads an opposition party, Avanzada Progresista. We expect Mr Maduro to be victorious in elections riddled with irregularities. We do expect relatively free and fair elections following the PSUV's exit from power.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Venezuela has come under increasing regional and international pressure. Mercosur (a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and the so-called Lima Group (a group of 12 Latin American nations) have denounced the regime. The EU and the US have applied individual sanctions on regime members. In addition, the US has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Although the application of sanctions on the oil trade is not part of our baseline forecast owing to the potential cost to American business and consumers, should such measures be introduced they would be politically destabilising to the administration and could potentially prove a trigger to regime change.
A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia. The latter continues to provide limited financial backing, but it seems increasingly unlikely to provide the several billions of dollars needed each year not just to reverse default but also to stem the decline of oil output. China, a previous major source of financing, has seemingly with-drawn; there is no public evidence of any significant new Chinese financing since 2015.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government's immediate economic policy concern will be fending off debt default and associated legal challenges. The government has gone into arrears on some sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including PDVSA bonds), while also reportedly making late payments on others. We estimate current arrears in excess of US$1.7bn. The government has restated its commitment to pay while blaming payments delays on US sanctions and the payment system. Mr Maduro has called for a debt restructuring, but this appears impossible owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme
There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the promise of late payment to lengthy legal battles. The expectation of policy changes following the May elections, something that we consider unlikely, may also be influencing bondholder's behaviour. Eventually, this stance is likely to change. To avoid PDVSA asset seizures, the government may choose to openly default on sovereign bonds but adhere to PDVSA's repayment schedule. So far it has done neither. If it did openly default, sovereign creditors would undoubtedly ask US courts to define PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government in order to seize its assets. However, such claims will take time, making timing of likely seizures unclear. When they do happen, the consequences on the economy will be devastating and would potentially trigger a regime change.
In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. Monetisation of large public deficits has led to foreign currency rationing and hyperinflation. In line with our expectations, the government undertook a maxi-devaluation in February 2018, but even at current rates the currency remains overvalued and foreign exchange remains rationed. Economic policy will remain unstainable and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist.
Under our baseline scenario we expect the opposition to come to power in 2019. An adjustment package, including a restructuring of debt, would follow. We have factored into our forecasts a financing agreement with the IMF to support the process, assuming lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. We also expect significant financial and real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) accounts since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a NFPS deficit of 19.3% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2022. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Under our baseline forecast of severe economic stress that would see the opposition taking power in 2019, we expect a restructuring with external creditors to happen.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's financing needs, forcing the BCV to print money. Money supply (M2) rose by 1,845% year on year in February. In the context of hyperinflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, we forecast substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government, which will lead to a return to real positive interest rates.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast for a recovery in 2021-22 rests on an assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme, including management of the country's oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Oil output will continue to shrink throughout 2018-19, reflecting a combination of severe mismanage-ment, underinvestment and depletion of oil fields. We expect output to bottom out at 1.30m barrels/day (b/d) in 2019, down from 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecasts, oil production will pick up in 2020, reflecting renewed investment under a new government. Exports, however, will only recover in 2021, as domestic demand has been artificially constrained. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply. Dependence on oil will persist in 2018-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. We do not expect a policy reversal under the PSUV government, meaning that inflation will remain extremely high in the short term. Official data has not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 84% in January, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 4,000%. We now expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. Shortages of basic goods will continue, as the lack of foreign currency limits imports. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Despite the recent announcement of exchange-rate unification and maxi-devaluation, the currency remains overvalued and further currency adjustment will be necessary. Rationing of foreign currency will continue in the short term. In late January the BCV announced that the Dicom system, a heavily managed auction platform, would be used by both the private and public sectors. In late February, after a months-long suspension, the Dicom rate was BsF24,898:US$1, a massive devaluation from the previous Dicom rate of BsF3,445:US$1. The Dicom rate has continued to depreciate, but the system remains opaque and provides no guarantee that the government-which monopolises the country's export business-will provide foreign exchange, making the auction system unsustainable. Indeed, in addition to rationing foreign exchange, the BCV has already announced difficulties in settling trades since February. This, coupled with runaway growth in the money supply, will continue to put pressure on the exchange rate. The black-market foreign-exchange rate was at around BsF205,000:US$1 in early March.
Given the existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. In our baseline scenario of a MUD-led government in 2019, similar measures may be undertaken. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$2.9bn in 2018 (0.6% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms). Even though we assume that extreme compression of imports will continue (we estimate imports in 2018 will be one-fifth their level of 2012), Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state companies' bonded debt alone amount to US$4.2bn. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and that imports will begin a recovery. We foresee the current account to go into a deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2020 at the no-longer so highly distorted exchange rate. Recovering oil production and the re-structured interest payment schedule facilitate a narrowing of the current-account deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2022.
With the opposition in power, financial and investment inflows will provide sufficient financing and help to rebuild reserves coverage. This will buttress the stability of the external accounts and facilitate the gradual removal of foreign-exchange controls, narrowing the gap between official and parallel exchange rates. There are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. It hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process within 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, moving Turkey closer to one-man rule. Since the failed coup in 2016 Mr Erdogan's domestic political goal, notably to become president with executive powers, has heavily conditioned foreign policy. A presidential system of government will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. [...]we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to have expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Turkey is due to hold municipal elections in March 2019 and parliamentary and presidential elections in November that year. However, the parliamentary and presidential elections could be held earlier than scheduled, either with the municipal elections or even in 2018, if the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) believe they have sufficient support to win, or if economic headwinds pose a risk to their electoral dominance.
After the presidential and parliamentary elections an executive presidency will replace the current parliamentary system of government. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, moving Turkey closer to one-man rule. Since the failed coup in 2016 Mr Erdogan's domestic political goal, notably to become president with executive powers, has heavily conditioned foreign policy. This has resulted in a deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. We expect annual budget deficits to widen moderately, to 2.4% of GDP on average in 2018-19, before narrowing gradually after the elections to 1.6% of GDP in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from an estimated 7% in 2017 to a still robust 4.1% per year on average in our forecast period (2018-22), reflecting higher taxes and the withdrawal of stimulus measures. Our growth forecast assumes that domestic political conditions will stabilise and foreign investor confidence in Turkey will hold up, maintaining foreign capital inflows.
After a fall in the nominal value of the Turkish lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. Constrained in its ability to raise interest rates, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to currency weakness and high inflation.
We expect the current-account deficit to remain broadly unchanged in 2018 at 5.7% of GDP before narrowing to a still large annual average of 5.2% of GDP in 2019-22. This will make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is severely constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 55th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: The customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, have been announced for 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious, but political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates continues. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications. The first phase of the third Istanbul airport becomes operational.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. A presidential system of government will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence from the government. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised, from 20% to 22%, in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) came to US$166bn and imports (fob) to US$224bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn-a sharp widening from US$41bn in 2016. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Turkey is due to hold municipal elections in March 2019 and parliamentary and presidential elections in November that year. However, the parliamentary and presidential elections could be held earlier than scheduled, either with the municipal elections or even in 2018, if the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) believe that they have sufficient support to win, or if economic headwinds pose a risk to their electoral dominance. After these votes an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parliamentary system. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving the country into a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
We expect social and political tensions to remain high during the period up to the elections in 2019, and possibly beyond. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, has further polarised the country. It also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and his party were losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place until after the elections, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place. The politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence from the government.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1980s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria are seeking to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk further fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. The defeat of IS in Syria and Iraq could result in renewed attacks in Turkey and elsewhere.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
As things stand, we expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the next presidential and parliamentary elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and he has the support of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process. However, there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, and that victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election is far from assured, especially if Abdullah Gul, a former president and co-founder of the AKP, decides to run. The challenge of Mr Gul, combined with that of the charismatic Meral Aksener-who recently formed the Good Party (IP), a breakaway group from the MHP-and the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, could prevent Mr Erdogan from reaching the 50% threshold for victory in the first round. This would transform the second-round run-off between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes into a deeply polarising referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. The HDP risks falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation. This would boost the AKP's seat share. Support for the MHP has also fallen, but in exchange for the MHP's backing of Mr Erdogan in the presidential election the two parties have agreed an electoral alliance to ensure that the MHP retains its representation in parliament. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a considerable risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding their concerns that under Mr Erdogan the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of the country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably to become president with executive powers after the next elections, due in 2019.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends the country's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over alleged violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces, or it withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out completely. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey´s crossborder military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria that was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US. The operation aims to clear the area of US-backed, PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups that are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period (2018-22). These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. Under political pressure to not raise interest rates further, especially ahead of the 2019 elections, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. In the event of another severe weakening of the lira, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary. However, this is not our baseline scenario.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between moderate fiscal loosening and relatively tight monetary policy, at the same time as encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016. As a result, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to have expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 1.5% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, we expect increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects and public employment ahead of the elections next year to cause the deficit to widen further, to an average of 2.4% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing to 1.6% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to remain stable at about 28.5% in 2017-19, before declining gradually to 27.5% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and to prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances has increased, reflecting the impact of political instability ahead of the next elections.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). However, because of political pressure not to raise interest rates further, we expect the central bank to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to the challenge, which will periodically test investor confidence in the bank's policy mix of moderate rate increases and macroprudential measures. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, but since November 2017 it has focused on using its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate to fund the banking system. This rate was gradually raised by a total of 275 basis points in 2017, to 12.75% in mid-December, pushing the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system to 12.75% since January 2018, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
We estimate that real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7% in 2017. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of 4.1% in 2018-22, reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates and a gradual tightening of global liquidity. The main downside risk is that further political instability stemming from the transition to a presidential system of government could deter foreign capital inflows. Upside risk stems from government plans to extend stimulus measures, but this could also result in a larger than expected fiscal deficit.
We are forecasting that household consumption growth will moderate from an estimated 5.5% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.4% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and the withdrawal in late 2017 of government incentives to support household spending, but some of these could be extended. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from an estimated annual average of 2.5% in 2017 to 5.8% in 2018-19, easing after the elections to a more moderate, but still robust, 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure, generating real growth of 5.5% per year in 2018-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, especially in the tourism sector, the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect growth to slow from an estimated 11.9% in 2017 to an annual average rate of 4.7% in 2018-22, reflecting base effects and our view that 2017 probably represented the recent peak in global economic growth.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we are currently forecasting.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
After a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow during the forecast period, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. There are substantial risks to this forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region. We expect the lira to average TL4.26:US1 in 2022, compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports has offset the boost to Turkey's main exports from a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions. Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, we now expect the current-account deficit to remain broadly unchanged in 2018 at 5.7% of GDP, compared with 5.6% of GDP in 2017. Reflecting moderating domestic demand growth and more stable global commodity prices, we forecast that the deficit will narrow to a still large annual average of 5.2% of GDP in 2019-22. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. The rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. [...]real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states, as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just below 70% by 2022, from an estimated 79.7% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.5%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16 and 2.2% in 2017. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain stable overall, at 2.2% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improving economy. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. No progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition, as well as party, in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, economy minister and leader of the ÖVP. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and reformed the party around himself. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
The ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition in mid-December after just over a month and a half of negotiations. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved close to the FPÖ in many policy areas (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly accused Mr Kurz of copying the FPÖ's programme) and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
Although the chancellor is from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between them and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, where they are significantly less well aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals, owing in part to internal party upheaval. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) until the end of its term in late 2022. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Three elections for state parliaments have already been held so far in 2018, with one more planned. These tend to be fought on local issues and give only a limited view of national political developments. Nevertheless, the FPÖ's recent underperformance in Carinthia could push it to take stronger stances on the national level.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which could exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The new government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc in the coming years, especially on reform of migration, and this should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. We expect the government to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, the reception has been more muted this time. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new govern-ment plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexibility for working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. However, it does not plan to reform the country's so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and SPÖ had apportioned public life-state companies, public services, subsidies, regulatory responsibilities-despite suggestions from both coalition parties in the past, especially from the FPÖ, that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and for the government to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 2% in 2013, and public debt rose to 83.7% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending. Strong growth contributed to an estimated narrowing of the deficit to an estimated 1.1% of GDP in 2017.
We expect the budget to remain in modest deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Although there will be only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.7% in 2017 to just below 70% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low-interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although it remains dovish, we expect a more upbeat tone to emerge this year, and an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme by early 2019. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25%, in early 2020, followed by five more rises that lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and underperformed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector, and we expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.8% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.5%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards its potential growth rate in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019-22. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments, including any shocks to global trade.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. The recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 and has since receded, but it remains above US$1.20:EUR1. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in the wake of the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect the trade balance to gradually decline, moving closer to balance in the coming years as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, the services balance will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly flat throughout 2018-22, at 2.2% of GDP on average.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Following the snap general election on June 8th, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, the prime minister, Theresa May, formed a minority government based on a "confidence and supply" agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The government will be fragile, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect it to last a full five-year term; its working majority of 13 (down from 17 before the election) will be eroded by by-elections, and it will face domestic and external challenges during the Brexit process.
Mrs May's position, which had become increasingly difficult, was boosted by the deal achieved in December 2017 on the first phase of the Brexit negotiations. However, there is a risk that tensions within the cabinet and the Conservative Party over the government's Brexit strategy will come to a head in 2018-19, resulting in a political crisis.
In March 2017 parliament approved Article 50, beginning the two-year process by which the UK will leave the EU. Completing the agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will take priority in 2018, but talks on the future trading relationship will begin this year. The government intends to leave the single market and the customs union, and will aim to reach a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the EU. The UK will formally leave the single market in March 2019, but a transition period should minimise disruption while trade negotiations continue. We expect a trade deal to be in place by 2021.
The economy has been resilient in the wake of the Brexit vote, growing by 1.9% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, but is likely to lose momentum in 2018-19 as rising inflation and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations dampen domestic demand. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019 as the economy adjusts, picking up to an average of 1.8% per year in 2020-22.
The government's budget deficit has narrowed from 4.3% of GDP in 2015, but we expect it to stabilise at close to 2016 and 2017 levels (2.8% of GDP) in 2018 as the government eases off its austerity drive. A deficit will persist throughout the forecast period (2018-22), contracting to less than 2% of GDP in 2021. The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has signalled a readiness to raise interest rates again after doing so in November 2017 for the first time in a decade. However, we expect that a slowdown in economic growth in early 2018 will delay a move to normalise policy until later in the year.

The UK's business environment score improves in 2018-22 compared with 2013-17, lifting the country by four places in the global ranking and by two places in the regional ranking. The Brexit vote has introduced some policy uncertainty. However, the UK's traditional strengths as a business location-a pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will endure.
Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Lloyds, one of two banks rescued post-crisis by the state, returns to full private ownership; government retains big stake in struggling Royal Bank of Scotland. Brexit focus constrains reforms to improve weak trends in investment and productivity.
2020-22: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks post-Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Business lobbying for government "assurances" will intensify during Brexit talks. Government pursues policies to encourage foreign direct investment inflows.
2020-22: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Talks begin on post-Brexit UK-EU free-trade agreement. UK leaves EU single market (and probably customs union). Possible disruption to crossborder trade. Risk of no deal, with UK subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules.
2020-22: Terms of new UK-EU trading arrangement phased in.
Taxes
2018-19: Gradual rise in total tax burden, alongside further reduction in corporate tax rate. Changes to system of business rates. Possible tax incentives to encourage investment and prevent companies from relocating outside UK prior to Brexit.
2020-22: Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to tax evasion. Possible tax increases to support the public finances.
Financing
2018-19: Modest tightening in financial conditions likely in run-up to Brexit. Loose monetary policy persists. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Demand for alternative forms of debt financing.
2020-22: Availability of finance unchanged. Possible loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade.
The labour market
2018-19: Firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Possible modest decline in inflows of EU workers. New apprenticeship levy and phased increase in compulsory "national living wage". Wage growth remains subdued.
2020-22: Some form of restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but likely to be flexible in response to business concerns. Policymakers struggle to respond to weak productivity and deficit in intermediate skills.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operating.
2020-22: Construction continues on high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. Steady decline in EU-funded investment activity across UK.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The main opposition Labour Party increased its parliamentary seats by 30 in the June 2017 snap general election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws parliamentary constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis, with an exceptionally loose monetary stance. Real GDP growth slowed in 2015-16. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Managing Brexit could force policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 20% since April 2015. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2016 exports of goods totalled US$408.1bn and imports amounted to US$591bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$182.9bn. The traditional services surplus fell to US$127.8bn. The overall current-account deficit widened in absolute terms, to US$154.9bn, from US$149.8bn in 2015, and expanded as a share of GDP, to 5.8%, from 5.2%.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The decision of the prime minister, Theresa May, to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May's authority was further undermined by a calamitous speech at the Conservative Party conference in October, prompting calls by some in the party for a leadership contest. However, Mrs May will stay in place for now, because there is no obvious alternative who could unite both wings of the party. The Conservatives fear another general election given that the momen-tum is with the main opposition Labour Party. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last the duration of the Brexit negotiations, until March 2019, and there is a significant risk of another pre-term election.
The Conservatives have formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). This arrangement is likely to work in the short term, because neither party wants another election-they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the government's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
In late 2017 the government was rocked by a series of scandals related to allegations of sexual and procedural misconduct by members of parliament, leading to the resignation of several senior members of the government. The cabinet and government reshuffle that followed in January further illustrated the prime minister's weakened authority. However, the reshuffle has neither altered the balance of power in the government nor its standing in the country, particularly after it secured a deal with the European Commission in December that allowed Brexit talks to move to a second phase. The deal was an important accomplishment for Mrs May and appears to have guaranteed her political survival in the short term.
Nevertheless, divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to resurface this year as ministers discuss the government's aims in the next stage of the negotiations. Brexiteers in the cabinet have been supportive of Mrs May since the election because they want her to hold fast to her pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This faction includes the Brexit secretary, David Davis; the international trade secretary, Liam Fox; the environment minister, Michael Gove; and the foreign affairs minister, Boris Johnson. They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit, who favour an extended post-2019 transition period, during which the UK would retain single-market and/or customs union access. This group includes the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd. These divisions could sharpen, presenting a threat to government stability in 2018.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
A snap general election was held on June 8th 2017, three years ahead of schedule. Mrs May's decision to call the election was a political miscalculation, resulting in the Conservatives losing 13 seats, leaving them with 318 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons (the lower house of parliament). The Labour Party won 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 parliamentary seats. The DUP, which increased its share of parliamentary seats from eight to ten, became kingmaker.
The next general election is scheduled for May 2022. Despite Mrs May's weakened position, the Conservatives remain on about 40% in opinion polls-a few percentage points below Labour. Risks to political stability are high, and some within the government have called for a leadership contest. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Conservative Party to see through the Brexit negotiations in 2018-21 before contemplating changing the party leadership and risking precipitating another early general election, for which there is no appetite.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
The Brexit negotiations will shape the UK's international relations during our forecast period (2018-22) and beyond. In line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and the budget, the UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019, but we expect a transition period to minimise disruption while trade negotiations continue. This is likely to mean continued adherence to many EU rules for a period of about two years after withdrawal. Despite political pressure to stay in the EU customs union, the UK government's official line is that it will leave to pursue an independent trade policy. However, we expect some degree of regulatory alignment that will mean less new physical and technological infrastructure at border areas that might otherwise have been required outside the customs union. The government is likely to seek a complete alignment of regulations in some areas; "mutual recognition" sufficient to sustain trade flows in others; and divergence in other areas where the UK would like to set its own regulations.
At the end of 2017 UK and EU negotiators reached an agreement in principle across the three areas under discussion in the first phase of the Brexit talks-citizens' rights, the Irish border and the divorce bill-enabling the talks to move on to transition arrangements and trade. These will come with their own set of challenges, with competing interests among the member states likely to complicate the process. During trade talks the EU will resist any attempt by the UK to cherry-pick from the benefits of membership, but the end result is still likely to be a more comprehensive trade deal than that negotiated by the EU and Canada in 2016.
There are numerous obstacles to the successful conclusion of the negotiations, but we believe that compromises will make a deal possible, particularly given the economic incentive to maintain existing trade ties. Realistically, only the framework of a trade deal will be agreed by the time the UK withdraws in 2019, as completing the withdrawal agreement will take priority in 2018. However, transition arrangements will allow negotiations to continue, and we expect a deal to be in place by 2021.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The UK's departure from the EU will encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infra-structure. Mr Hammond announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and develop-ment over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. There will also be a new effort to improve vocational skills. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are still too modest in size and scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In the autumn budget in November 2017 the chancellor undertook fiscal loosening while avoiding radical steps. The centrepieces of the budget were a sizeable increase in spending on the National Health Service (NHS) and measures designed to address a dysfunctional housing market. Mr Hammond allocated more money to the government's flagship productivity plan, and a raft of smaller policy measures addressed specific issues related to low incomes, welfare, education and tax avoidance. The new policy measures, combined with cuts to the UK's growth forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), pushed up the borrowing profile. Mr Hammond did not give a timeline for balancing the budget. In a new Spring Statement in March Mr Hammond will present updated forecasts from the OBR, although this is not expected to contain major adjustments to the existing budget plans.
After a better than expected performance, we estimate that the deficit stabilised at 2.9% of GDP in 2017, and we expect it to stay at around that level in 2018 as the government eases off from its austerity drive. However, in the remainder of our forecast period the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to narrow to 1.9% of GDP by 2021 and 1.6% by 2022. The public debt burden stood at 88.2% of GDP in 2016. We forecast that public debt will peak at just below 89% of GDP in 2018, before falling thereafter.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
At its meeting in February the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted unanimously to keep the main policy interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, four months after raising it by 25 basis points for the first time in a decade. Nevertheless, the BoE revised up its forecasts for GDP growth which-combined with the bank's expectation that there will be only modest growth in supply capacity in the coming years-now implies that there will be greater demand-driven price pressures in the economy, keeping inflation above its 2% target and squeezing real incomes. As a result, there was a more hawkish tone in the bank's communication; it signalled that the next rate rise would occur much sooner in 2018 than markets had previously expected.
The MPC is clearly ready to tighten policy, but our forecast suggests that growth will be slower than the BoE's projection, meaning that it is likely to delay the next move until the end of 2018. We expect a gradual tightening cycle to follow, with a series of 25-basis-point increases in the policy rate over the next five years, taking it to 2.25% by end-2022. If the economy performs more strongly than anticipated in the early part of 2018, the bank could very well move sooner than the fourth quarter, possibly at the time of the next inflation reports in May or August.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
The economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017, from 2.1% in January-March to 1.5% in October-December. We forecast a further modest growth slowdown in the next two years, to 1.5% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019, led by a slowdown in domestic demand. A looser fiscal stance will provide some positive support to real GDP growth throughout the forecast period, but consumer spending will weaken in response to the squeeze on household disposable incomes from falling real wages. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a sharp drawdown of savings. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened uncertainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, while the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. The export boost will ease in 2019, after which we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.8% on average in 2020-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-accelerated to 2.6% on average in 2017, up from 1% in 2016. The increase partially reflected a rebound in oil prices, but has been amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote. The pound has since reversed much of this appreciation, but we expect it to weaken again in 2018-20, and oil prices are likely to rise further this year. As retailers continue to pass on high input costs to customers, we expect inflation to remain above the BoE's official 2% target for much of 2018, averaging 2.5%, even as domestic price pressure weakens. Tighter monetary policy from 2019 will bring inflation back towards its target; we forecast that it will ease to 2.2% next year and 2.1% on average in 2020-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow has led to significant volatility in the value of the pound, albeit within a range of US$1.20-1.27:£1 until April 18th 2017, when Mrs May called the snap election. This initially boosted the value of the pound, but it fell back sharply in June in response to the shock result. The pound appreciated in the second half of 2017, supported by expectations of tighter monetary policy and a breakthrough in the first round of Brexit talks in December. An increase in political risk in the US in January 2018 then triggered a surge in the US dollar:pound exchange rate to a post-referendum high of US$1.43:£1.
The exchange rate has since receded from this level, but it remained close to US$1.40:£1 in February, and we now forecast that it will average US$1.35:£1 this year, after averaging US$1.29:£1 in full-year 2017. This forecast reflects the recent resilience in the pound (partly because of the performance of the economy), but also assumes that it will weaken as Brexit negotiations enter their most challenging phase and as the economy slows. We expect sterling to depreciate further against the US dollar and the euro in 2019, before making a gradual recovery in the final years of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The merchandise trade balance will keep the current account in deficit through-out 2018-22, offsetting surpluses on the services account. We expect a narrowing of the current-account deficit, from an estimated 4.9% of GDP in 2017 to 4.6% in 2022 (following a current-account deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2016), reflecting a shift in the primary income balance as the under-performance of the UK economy reduces income debits (the return that foreign residents receive on their investments in the UK) relative to credits (the return that UK residents receive from their foreign direct investment), and a reduction in secondary transfers from 2021 as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget.

Abstract: [...]even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels.[...]this will be largely offset by a drop in palm oil prices as global production surges but with changing consumer habits resulting in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products.The recent recovery in global oil prices will also play a role, as this incentivises farmers to divert more cane to ethanol (rather than to its rival, sugar), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth through--out the forecast period.2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Cocoa (US cents/lb) 110.6 138.9 142.2 131.1 92.1 89.6 88.7 89.0 92.0 94.0 Coffee (Arabica) (US cents/lb) 139.5 200.7 159.9 163.8 150.7 139.5 153.8 176.0 173.0 175.0 Coffee (Robusta) (US cents/lb) 94.2 100.5 88.0 88.6 101.0 96.8 103.5 98.0 100.0 103.5 Tea (US$/kg) 2.86 2.72 2.71 2.64 3.10 3.00 2.81 2.82 2.85 2.92 Sugar (US cents/lb) 17.7 17.0 13.4 18.1 16.0 15.5 16.3 17.0 17.3 17.6 Barley (US$/tonne) 206.4 146.1 127.9 129.4 138.5 142.5 145.8 135.6 140.9 146.1 Maize (US$/tonne) 264.4 206.0 175.5 168.3 160.9 162.5 172.5 175.0 182.0 187.0 Rice (US$/tonne) 489.5 423.8 386.0 386.0 389.8 412.5 420.0 409.0 417.0 427.0 Sorghum (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 866.2 890.8 911.3 847.8 880.6 913.4 Wheat (US$/tonne) 321.5 302.7 232.5 197.5 211.5 217.5 222.5 207.0 215.0 223.0 Soybeans (US$/tonne) 556.5 501.3 379.8 389.8 377.0 381.3 392.5 401.0 409.0 419.0 Soybean oil (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 845.5 882.0 908.1 927.2 946.2 946.2 Soymeal (US$/tonne) 545.3 527.9 394.8 379.8 358.8 368.3 369.5 387.1 395.1 395.1 Palm oil (US$/tonne) 856.9 821.4 622.7 700.2 714.1 684.8 614.8 585.0 600.0 608.0 Rapeseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,079.3 907.3 775.3 823.5 874.5 934.5 946.8 989.0 990.0 1,002.0 Sunflowerseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,124.0 901.8 845.8 841.0 801.8 846.3 914.5 875.0 860.0 866.0 Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Note. WCF (World commodity forecasts) is an index of 22 hard and soft commodities. FFB (Food, feedstuffs and beverages) is a price index of 13 soft commodities. The beverages sector has a weight of 20% in the FFB index, grains 46.4%, oilseeds 28.6% and sugar 4.9%. The FFB index has a weight of 55.6% in the WCF index.
Agricultural prices will remain weak in early 2018, sinking the annual average
In 2018 The Economist Intelligence Unit's food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index is set to halt its seven-year decline, with prices rising by a marginal 0.2%. This follows a relatively moderate drop in the price index in 2017, of 0.9%, as the markets for some agricultural goods, including oilseeds and grains such as wheat, maize and rice are beginning to tighten slightly. Nonetheless, most agricultural markets remain comfortably supplied, following several years of bumper harvests. Several crops registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. The rising possibility of a La Niña weather phenomenon poses some uncertainties, but risks to our forecasts are fairly moderate, given that forecasters expect a mild and short-lived episode. In general, La Niña tends to have a more muted effect than El Niño events, with drier than normal weather in some producing regions of South America and Asia often being offset by better growing conditions in West Africa. We expect the FFB index to begin to firm from late 2018 and to rise by an average of 2.7% in 2019 as some markets tighten further, causing prices for goods such as coffee, cocoa and wheat, to recover from rock bottom. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) of FFB goods in the medium and long term.
The recovery in agricultural prices in 2019 will be fairly modest
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw upon. We expect global GDP growth to remain fairly robust, at an average of 2.9% per year in 2018-19, down only slightly from estimated growth of 3% in 2017. However, uncertainty about global monetary policy, together with the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast), continue to pose downside risks to demand. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. We expect the US dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19; this will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further inflating global supplies. As a result, even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels.
Grain prices will post small rises, failing to recover to 2015 levels in 2018-19
We expect grain prices to rise by a relatively modest 2.2% in 2018, as comfortable supplies continue to weigh on wheat and maize prices. Nonetheless, the price growth follows several years of decline as supply surged and global stocks accumulated. For wheat in particular, international prices appear to have found a floor. In 2017 initial concerns over drought in the northern US Plains region and dryness in parts of the EU, Australia and the Black Sea region proved to be overblown. Global supplies were more than adequate that season, limiting price gains to 7.1% in 2017. Wheat prices have proved more resilient in recent months; however, amid overall heavy world availabilities and strong competition for available export business, we expect prices to rise only modestly, by 2.6% per year on average in 2018-19. Maize prices will remain fairly weak in the first half of 2018, undermined by the bumper 2016/17 crop, before inching up steadily in late 2018 and 2019 as global consumption rises-particularly for use in animal feed-and the market tightens.
Oilseed prices will rise in 2018-19 as oversupplied markets begin to tighten
Oilseed prices fell by an estimated 1.6% in 2017, owing largely to the bumper soybean crop in major producers such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stocks higher. However, we expect the price of soybeans, as well as sunflowerseed oil and rapeseed oil, to see fairly strong growth in 2018-19 as market supply begins to tighten and global demand continues to expand. However, this will be largely offset by a drop in palm oil prices as global production surges but with changing consumer habits resulting in lower demand growth-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We forecast the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee, cocoa and tea, to fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We forecast cocoa prices to decline at a modest rate of 1.8% per year in 2018-19; however, this follows a massive drop in 2017, of nearly 30%, which was caused by soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices are forecast to fall by 7.1% in 2018, on the back of higher than expected production from Central America, as well as the relatively strong US dollar-which will encourage exporters to sell their stocks, bringing new supplies onto the market. In 2019, however, we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to rebound, by 10.2%, as several consecutive years of market deficits begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2018-19, but by a marginal amount
Sugar prices declined by 11.3% in 2017 as the market corrected after a price spike in late 2016 related to fears that supply from Thailand would be heavily affected by poor weather conditions. We expect global sugar consumption to expand by a relatively modest 1.4% per year in 2018-19, in part as high domestic prices limit demand in India, the second-largest global consumer. On the back of modest demand, we expect prices to weaken in 2018. The recent recovery in global oil prices will also play a role, as this incentivises farmers to divert more cane to ethanol (rather than to its rival, sugar), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth through--out the forecast period.

Cocoa
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that, after having contracted for two consecutive crop years, cocoa consumption grew by a marginal 0.4% in the 2016/17 season (October-September). Although cocoa demand is expected to accelerate slightly during the forecast period, by an average of 1.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19, it remains fairly weak by historical comparison. Recent cocoa grind data point to a stronger third quarter of 2017 in Asia, the US and to a lesser extent Europe, in line with our projection for a pick-up in demand. However, none of the major developed markets will be in a position to fuel rapid growth in cocoa demand, reflecting high existing cocoa consumption levels per head. In contrast to some other soft commodity markets, where producing countries are starting to become major consumers, cocoa consumption levels among producers are (and will remain) extremely low, hampering the scope for firmer global growth in cocoa consumption. Meanwhile, recent falls in cocoa prices will be slow to feed through to retail prices, which will continue to push some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. The average size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity, but also to protect profits during a time of high cocoa prices-also hampering cocoa consumption growth in the forecast period.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in much of the OECD-even factoring in a gradual slowdown in China in 2018. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounts for 26% of the world's imports of cocoa powder, compared with just 13% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to boost demand for powder.
Higher prices will slow consumption growth in developed markets
Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for nearly 20% of global demand) and Europe (which collectively accounts for 40% of global demand) are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate (with a higher cocoa content), but with less frequent purchases. Recent sales figures from the main chocolate manufacturers indicate that, on balance, this is pushing down overall consumption. This is illustrated by data from 2015/16, which show that cocoa demand contracted in several large markets (including the US and Canada) and grew only marginally in others (including in Europe), despite fairly strong underlying economic conditions in many of these areas.
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2017/18-2018/19. Health concerns, market saturation and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping is eroding spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases). However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption.
Russian and Brazilian cocoa consumption will begin to recover
Lower cocoa consumption in 2015/16 in Brazil and Russia, which together account for nearly 10% of global demand, demonstrate the extent to which cocoa demand is affected by underlying economic conditions, particularly in developing economies, where chocolate is not regarded as a basic good. We estimate that both of these countries saw consumption contract further in 2016/17-reflecting the high cost of cocoa in local-currency terms. For Russia, restrictions on a number of imports from the EU that have been in place since mid-2014 are having an adverse effect on demand for many consumer goods. We expect cocoa demand in Russia to continue to stage a gradual recovery in 2017/18-2018/19, growing by an average 1.4% per year, as underlying economic growth recovers. The same is true of Brazil, where we expect cocoa demand to return to growth, of 1.5% per year on average, assuming that the economy continues to recover slowly.
Cocoa consumption growth will slow in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels (at just 37 g in India and 59 g in China in 2015/16, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets). However, demand will be hampered by high retail prices and, in China, consumer caution, particularly in 2018-19. Although Chinese demand will continue to rise, we expect the pace of growth to slow to an average of 3.4% per year in 2017/18-2018/19, from an estimated 5% in 2016/17. In India, however, we expect demand growth to pick up from 3.4% in 2016/17 to 4.1% per year in the forecast period.

Supply
Global cocoa production surged by an estimated 15.6% in 2016/17 on the back of improved weather conditions, after a particularly difficult El Niño event and a severe harmattan season (a dry winter wind blowing from the Sahara) cut cocoa output in many of Africa's main producers in 2015/16. We expect global cocoa production to fall during 2017/18 and 2018/19, by 7.2% and 1.2% respectively, mainly reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire-the world's largest cocoa producer. Its output will remain high by historical comparison, but another bumper crop is unlikely, reflecting lower farm gate prices and weaker confidence among growers. Overall, recent price weakness is likely to dissuade farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticide, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production. The rising possibility of a La Niña weather phenomenon poses some uncertainties, but risks to our forecasts are fairly moderate, given that forecasters expect a mild and short-lived episode, if it arrives. Although El Niño episodes do tend to disrupt production, La Niña tends to have a more muted effect, with drier than normal weather in cocoa-producing regions in South America and Asia often being offset by better growing conditions in West Africa. As a result, our supply-side forecasts remain largely unchanged for now.
Structural and geographic factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farm gate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa but farmers also receive a much smaller share of the final retail price than in the previous decades, owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. In West Africa, for example, many farmers remain below the poverty line, and as a result few young people are choosing to work in the cocoa sector. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to attract new workers, but it is uncertain how effective this will be in the long term.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can be grown only in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) under warm and humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Periodically, there is speculation that climate change will hamper production in these countries to such an extent that cocoa production will plummet; most recently, a spate of press articles have warned that chocolate will disappear entirely from 2040. However, we believe that some countries have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of manufacturing facilities to grind beans in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production soared in 2016/17
In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa production jumped by nearly 30% in 2016/17, to a record of just over 2m tonnes. However, this upward trend is not expected to continue, and we forecast that cocoa production will fall by 11.2% in 2017/18 and 2.2% in 2018/19. The authorities are unlikely to be able to replicate the exceptionally high level of output registered in 2016/17, with the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC), issuing fewer export licences and projecting production in 2017/18 in the range of 1.73m-1.75m tonnes. Port arrivals have fallen by around 11% in the first three months of the 2017/18 crop year, despite relatively favourable weather conditions. Although our production forecast is fairly strong by historical comparison, we expect output to fall steadily in the forecast period. Policy will not be particularly supportive: following a sharp cut to farm gate prices ahead of the mid-crop in March 2017, the CCC has kept prices on hold for the 2017/18 harvest, with price levels around one-third lower than a year ago. This has discouraged use of fertiliser and pesticide, with crop disease rising as a result. The government had hoped to raise farm gate prices, but any increase in the producer price would mean cutting export duties and therefore forgoing fiscal revenue, which is unlikely. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from price volatility, but these funds have been insufficient to shield farmers' incomes and-given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC-neither farmers nor exporters have confidence that losses arising from low global prices will be recouped.
Ghanaian government will struggle to boost cocoa production significantly
Similar production trends will be evident in Ghana. Cocoa production rebounded firmly in 2016/17, with favourable weather and a mild harmattan season lifting cocoa production to an estimated 925,000 tonnes (well above the official target of 800,000 tonnes). However, we do not expect further significant and sustained growth in production during 2018-19. For now, Ghana's cocoa board (Cocobod) has been more reluctant than the Ivorian authorities to cut prices paid to farmers, but Cocobod was forced to seek a bridging loan from Bank of Ghana (the central bank) last year, indicating that farm gate prices may need to be cut, particularly if global cocoa prices fail to recover. Combined with anxiety among farmers about the government's intentions to evolve agriculture towards other crops, ongoing encroachment by gold miners, the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser and the fact that around one-fifth of trees are affected by swollen shoot disease (which cuts yields), production is forecast to fall by 10.3% in 2017/18, before staging a partial (but weak) recovery in 2018/19, of 3.6%.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally three to five years). The authorities ultimately aim to raise production to 1.5m tonnes within four years, driven by better soil management, and better pest and disease control. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (Cocobod estimates 40%) and a consequent low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). However, it will be difficult to secure the necessary funding; we think that it is unlikely that these ambitious plans will come to fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment and external creditors are unlikely to fund the project.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
After recovering to 231,000 tonnes in 2016/17, according to Cameroon's cocoa authorities, production is forecast to weaken during 2018-19. Cuts in farm gate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". Port arrivals fell by around one-fifth during the first quarter of the 2017/18 crop year. Moreover, plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year have failed to materialise, with the area under cocoa cultivation rising by only around 3,000 ha since 2014, which will hamper the expansion of the cocoa sector.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has slumped in recent years as government initiatives meant to support farmers-including efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and to increase the distribution of free seedlings-have not been successful. With the country's mining and energy sector suffering from moderate inter-national oil prices, there is official acknowledgement that investment in raising cocoa production could generate greater foreign-exchange earnings, and the Ministry of Agriculture has recently outlined its ambitious goal of boosting cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. Its short-term goal is to lift cocoa production to 300,000-320,000 tonnes in 2017/18, with the medium-term target of raising output to 1m tonnes/year. However, problems with weak infrastructure, corruption, poor (and expensive) access to financing along with weak implementation will hamper these efforts.

Prospects are weak for Indonesia's cocoa sector
The authorities in Indonesia have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these are highly unlikely to materialise. Adverse weather hampered both the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 harvest, with cocoa output registering its third consecutive annual decline in the latter season. Assuming more stable weather conditions, output should resume growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19, but at an expected 320,000 tonnes at the end of the forecast period, cocoa output will remain weak by historical comparison. Indonesian firms are likely to rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from neighbouring Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America will not be realised in 2018-19
Agriculture in Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, was affected by El Niño in 2015/16. However, with better weather conditions, output is estimated to have recovered firmly in both countries in 2016/17. Structurally, there is scope for both countries to lift cocoa output as manufacturers look to boost investment in the region in an attempt to diversify production away from West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. However, some of this investment will be slow to materialise, as global prices remain depressed amid excess supply, which will act as a brake on growth potential.
Stocks and prices
We expect the surplus in the global cocoa market to narrow gradually, from an estimated 561,000 tonnes in 2016/17 to 98,000 tonnes by 2018/19. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that cocoa production will remain higher than consumption by some margin. Moderate demand growth makes a return to a market deficit unlikely during the forecast period. Stocks are forecast to reach just under 2.3m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is high by historical comparison. Moreover, there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output.

Ample global cocoa supplies will keep prices low during 2018-19
After remaining high for much of 2014-16, at around US$3,000/tonne, cocoa prices plummeted between December 2016 and late April 2017, hitting a low point of under US$1,900/tonne. Prices recovered somewhat during the remainder of 2017, but continued to trade at a comparatively low level, between US$2,000/tonne and US$2,100/tonne. Although global production prospects will remain weak in the near term, we consider a sustained recovery in prices to be unlikely, owing to the global supply glut. We forecast that prices will contract by 2.7% in 2018, to an average of US$1,975/tonne, and by a further 1% in 2019, to US$1,955/tonne.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption expanded by around 2.7% in both 2015/16 and 2016/17, largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries (mainly developed economies), which account for two-thirds of global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the pace of consumption growth to accelerate to 3.1% in 2017/18, aided by stronger underlying economic conditions in many of the large consuming markets, before slipping to 2% in 2018/19. Notwithstanding ongoing monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers, overall domestic demand is expected to remain firm, supporting coffee consumption. In coffee-producing countries (many of which are emerging markets) consumption growth will continue to average 2.4% per year, held back somewhat by tepid demand growth in Brazil (which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption, owing to the sheer size of its domestic market). Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China. Although we expect China's GDP growth rate to slow from 2018, the deceleration will be concentrated in the investment and industrial sectors, and we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, meaning that there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth. However, coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic coffee demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global consumption growth.
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America (with 46% of coffee in the US now consumed out of the home) and Europe, but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets. In some markets-including the US and China-the large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although comprising a small market share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that, in volume terms, the instant and ground coffee market remains larger. Although sales of machines and capsules are slowing sharply after initial firm growth, the coffee pod market will continue to provide important support for overall demand of arabica coffee (most pods contain predominantly arabica beans).
Coffee consumption growth in North America will increase steadily
US coffee consumption growth is forecast to average 1.6% a year in 2017/18-2018/19. Data from the US National Coffee Association show that the percentage of people drinking coffee is rising rapidly (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017). Daily consumption is rising and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products (US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over the past two years). There are indications that long-term consumption growth may continue to rise, with the number of coffee shops increasing at around 3.6% per year and the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee rising from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017. Demand growth among 18-24-year-olds also rising strongly.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers in particular show a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations. We expect Canada's demand growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to pick up slightly, to an average of 2.7%, in 2017/18-2018/19.
Coffee consumption in Brazil is expected to falter
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. However, a sharp economic recession has caused coffee consumption to remain flat in recent years, following firm growth in 2005-15. We expect coffee consumption growth to recover in 2017/18-2018/19, but to a fairly moderate pace of 1.3% per year on average. While economic growth is recovering, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment, rising fuel prices and higher inflation, which will all drag on disposable income.
Fairly firm coffee consumption growth is expected in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia (and the fourth-largest in the world), with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by 3.1% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption growth to rise by an average of 2.3% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. The slower pace of growth will reflect slightly weaker underlying economic conditions, after a comparatively rapid pace of economic growth in 2017. Nonetheless, annual growth in coffee con-sumption of 2.3% is firm given the size of the market, and will be under-pinned by rising coffee sales in convenience stores, as the number of coffee shops is falling. In South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with imports more than trebling between 2006 and 2016 and the number of coffee shops increasing even more rapidly. Although we forecast somewhat weaker growth in coffee consumption in 2017/18-2018/19, the pace of growth will remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 3.1%.
Coffee consumption in China and India-currently both small consumers-will continue to grow. Much of the growth in Chinese coffee consumption will be in the out-of-home sector, reflecting the rising popularity of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres. A significant share of the new stores opened by Starbucks in 2016-17 is in Asia. The company now runs 3,000 outlets in 135 Chinese cities (nearly 600 in Shanghai alone, Starbucks' largest presence in a single city), up from 2,300 last October, and is planning to have 5,000 stores open by 2021. We expect an economic slowdown in China in 2018, but the deceleration will be gradual and will largely be concentrated in the construction and industrial sectors. Given that we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth during 2017/18-2018/19.
Following a recent rapid expansion of the out-of-home sector in India, driven by comparatively low consumer price inflation, rising disposable income and favourable demographics (around one-half of the population is aged under 25), coffee consumption remained flat in 2016/17. We expect a return to growth in 2017/18-2018/19, with coffee consumption rising by an average of 3.3% per year. South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in some countries, mainly in coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam). Rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia, and opened its first store in Vietnam last October.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee (which generally use the robusta variety) in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.

Supply
After rising by 3.4% in the 2016/17 crop year (October-September), reflecting firm output growth in Brazil-the world's largest producer-coffee production is forecast to fall by 0.5% in 2017/18. This is mainly due to a forecast decline in Brazilian production as the biennial crop alternates between higher- and lower-producing years (2017/18 is an "off-season" crop year). This will be only partly offset by firmer output growth in most other producing countries. There is a risk that global coffee production could decline more rapidly than currently forecast, depending on whether a La Niña weather phenomenon develops in the coming months. This brings a fall in Pacific Ocean water temperatures, typically disrupting coffee output by bringing heavy rains to many of Asia's coffee producers and drought to the main Latin American growers. Our baseline forecast assumes that if it does, the episode will be short-lived and mild, so we have not downgraded our forecast at this stage. Global coffee production growth is expected to be much stronger in 2018/19, at 4.5%, as Brazil's crop shifts to an "on-season" year.
We envisage a growing concentration of coffee production among the world's largest producers. Currently, a large number of countries (around 70) produce coffee, but the smaller producers have been struggling as a result of low world prices and rising overheads. In many of these countries, where coffee is not a particularly important area of the economy, farmers wield less power and are less likely to secure government support than in leading producers. Partly as a result, we expect coffee output in "other" countries to decline from 8.9m 60-kg bags in 2015/16 to 7.8m bags in 2018/19. Output in these countries-which fall outside the world's top 17 producers-will account for less than 5% of global production in 2018/19, down from nearly 15% in 2008/09.
Annual coffee production in Brazil is expected to remain well over 50m bags
In Brazil, by far the world's largest producer, final data from the on-season 2016/17 crop were more positive than expected, with coffee output rising by over 9%. This could reflect the weak local currency, which incentivised local growers, as international coffee prices are denominated in US dollars. Prospects for the off-season 2017/18 crop year are fairly strong and we forecast output of 52m bags. This is higher than projections from Conab (the government's crop supply agency), but official forecasts usually prove conservative. Our forecast remains similar to local private-sector expectations and to that of the US Department of Agriculture. Although adverse weather in mid-2016-including drought in some areas and irregular rainfall in others-raised concerns that beans might be damaged ahead of the harvest, recent weather has been much more supportive, and the quality and quantity of beans have been good. Moreover, the still-weak local currency is continuing to provide an incentive to growers. Problems at some ports have hampered export capacity, but we do not expect this to have a major impact on overall supply.
Output projections for the 2018/19 crop year remain highly speculative. Local commentators have stated that they believe that there is potential for a bumper crop in 2018/19, with some even suggesting that output of up to 60m bags is possible, which would be a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). Although we believe that this figure is out of reach, we have upgraded our coffee production forecast from 55.5m to 56.2m bags, reflecting supportive weather conditions.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to recover from a severe drought
In Vietnam, the worst drought in three decades hampered production in 2016/17, with coffee output dropping by 11.3%. Assuming that weather conditions stabilise for the 2017/18 crop, there is scope for a rebound in Vietnam's coffee output; we forecast production of 27m bags, implying growth of 5.9%, followed by 3% growth (to 27.8m bags) in 2018/19. The authorities remain pessimistic about the medium-term prospects for production, forecasting coffee output to stabilise or decline slightly. However, government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop, will support firmer output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically high. Market jitters about widespread damage to coffee bushes from severe storms in coffee-growing areas in November 2017 were quickly allayed, and it appears that this bout of weather had minimal impact on coffee beans. In addition, firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will encourage growers.
Output from Mexico and Central America will rise moderately
Coffee production rebounded strongly in Mexico and Central America in 2016/17-rising by 17.5% year on year to 19.4m bags. This followed a severe outbreak of coffee rust, followed by an El Niño weather phenomenon, which damaged plantations in the three previous seasons. We have upgraded our forecast for the subregion this month; previously we expected production to slide moderately in 2017/18 as coffee rust returned to some countries. However, signs of another bumper crop in Honduras, as well as rising coffee output in Costa Rica and Mexico, will contribute to a continued rise in production during the forecast period. Recent purchases of fungicides and fertiliser will also provide support. We now expect regional production to rise by an average of 0.7% per year in 2017/18-2018/19.
Colombian production is set to stagnate in 2017/18 but rise again in 2018/19
Coffee production in Colombia has risen steadily in recent years, reaching a 24-year high of 14.5m bags in 2016/17. Prospects for 2017/18 are uncertain. The sector's fundamentals are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes. In addition, recent additional planting in existing plantations has focused on increasing average yields, which at 18 bags per hectare in 2016 was much lower than in other large growers (27 bags per hectare in Brazil and 35 bags per hectare in Vietnam). However, recent cloudy weather conditions are affecting flowering on coffee bushes, prompting us to cut our 2017/18 production forecast; we now expect output to remain flat (4.1% increase previously). In 2018/19 production should start to benefit from recent efforts to improve productivity; we expect output to rise by 5.5% that season, to 15.3m bags. In the medium term the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the then FARC rebels, will allow coffee cultivation to expand in previously isolated areas of the country (the government has speculated that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as a result).
In Indonesia coffee production is recovering, but remains weak overall
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector-which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil-have been completely derailed. El Niño brought excessive dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the 2016/17 harvest, when output fell by 6.7%. However, prospects for the 2017/18 season are stronger, and we expect production to rise by 4.4%. We expect production to grow by a further 2.5% in 2018/19, but, at just 12.3m bags, output will remain low by historical comparison.
Production prospects in Africa, which accounts for around 11% of total global coffee output, are relatively bright. Many of the continent's coffee producers have very low levels of output; together, Ethiopia and Uganda account for 70% of African coffee output. Production rose solidly in both countries in 2016/17, mainly on the back of better weather conditions. We expect coffee production to continue to rise over the forecast period, but for the increase to be sharper in Uganda, reflecting an extensive re-seeding programme in recent years and an expansion of the coffee-growing area. Progress in these areas has been more gradual in Ethiopia, where we expect production growth to be more modest.

Stocks and prices
After rising marginally in 2016/17, we expect global coffee stocks to fall in 2017/18-2018/19 as a larger market deficit offsets continued sales of stocks, with producers taking advantage of relatively weak local currencies against the US dollar. By end-2018/19 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 25.6m bags, from an estimated 31.6m bags in September 2017, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

Investment trends are likely to weigh on arabica prices again in 2018
Arabica prices fell steadily over the course of 2017, from an average of US$1.69/lb in January to US$1.37/lb in December. The full-year average price of US$1.50/lb marked an 8.3% decline compared with 2016. Given that the global market is set to register its third consecutive annual deficit in 2016/17, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often due to a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In late 2017 speculation about bumper production in Brazil pushed prices lower. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock in order to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
We believe that speculation about the 2018/19 harvest in Brazil and firm output in Mexico and Central America will continue to suppress prices, and have downgraded our 2018 forecast to an average of US$1.40/lb, from US$1.52/lb previously. This is in line with recent developments in futures markets, with prices for various delivery dates throughout the year remaining low. If production is disrupted on the back of a severe La Niña weather phenomenon, there is potential for prices to rebound sharply, given that prices remain low by historical comparison.However, this is not our core forecast. Given that the next "off-season" in Brazil (2019/20) is likely to hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery of prices, to an average of US$1.54/lb.
Tighter supplies of robusta beans and firm Asian demand will support prices
Prices for cheaper robusta held up better during much of 2017, reflecting concerns about the supply of robusta beans in the context of disappointing weather conditions in Vietnam and Indonesia, but dipped sharply in November-December as bean supply picked up. We expect prices to average 97 US cents/lb in 2018 (a 4.2% year-on-year decline) and US$1.04/lb in 2019.

Maize
Demand
Maize is the most consumed (and produced) grain in the world, with total annual demand now in excess of 1bn tonnes/year (t/y). It is a versatile grain, with around 60% of the total used for animal feed, almost 30% for industrial processing (mainly fuel ethanol and starch) and the rest consumed directly as food or seed, or lost through waste. After a period of spectacular growth, demand for maize-based biofuels is now increasing more slowly, even though overall levels of consumption are still setting new records each year. However, following reports about China's plans for a massive expansion of its own fuel ethanol sector, world use for biofuels could potentially rise sharply from current levels over the medium term. Furthermore, maize is the primary energy source in compound feed mixes, and with ample supplies predicted across the world, it is well placed to meet predicted gains in demand in meat-exporting countries, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where consumption of animal protein continues to expand. Maize is by far the dominant feed grain in much of the world, with annual consumption typically more than four times that of wheat. In 2017/18 The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global demand to rise by 2.7% year on year, with stronger uptake expected across the animal feed, industrial and food sectors. A similar trend is projected for 2018/19, with overall demand rising by 1.5%, to 1.1bn tonnes. Incorporating revised historical supply and demand estimates for Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly for direct human food use, global consumption forecasts back to 2009/10 to 2017/18 have been lifted in the period since the last report. However, the underlying trend remains unchanged, with consumption expanding almost every year.
World feed demand will rise by 2% in 2017/18
World demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient in animal feed, which can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. Overall use, however, depends on availabilities and price relationships with other grains-mainly wheat-as well as high-protein oilmeals. A multitude of other factors can also have a direct impact on feed demand in any particular year, with producers having to consider pasture conditions and availability, as well as desired livestock weight, the economics of the meat industry and feed efficiency ratios. In 2017/18 we expect global growth in use of maize for livestock feed to slow to around 2%, down from almost 7% in the previous season. Further growth in maize feed demand is likely in 2018/19, with total feed use forecast to reach a new all-time high.
Trade continues to increase year after year
Global maize trade in 2017/18 (July-June) is forecast to grow by 6.9% year on year, to reach a new record. Amid large surpluses across all the major exporters, global prices are soft, and maize remains very competitively priced for inclusion in feed rations. A number of large buyers are expected to increase imports, with particularly strong growth likely in Mexico, the EU and Taiwan. This will easily compensate for a reduction in purchases by Brazil and South Africa, two countries that secured unusually large amounts in 2016/17 owing to severe weather difficulties. The EU is expected to displace Japan as the world's leading importer this year, with shipments pegged at a record 17m tonnes, up by more than a quarter compared with 2016/17. Mexico's imports are projected to rise by 1.5m tonnes, to 15.5m tonnes, also a new all-time peak, relegating Japan to third place on the league table of the world's biggest buyers.
China announces plans to boost ethanol production
Years of supply and demand imbalances in China have led to a massive surplus, with stocks soaring to an unprecedented level in recent years. Over-production was mainly linked to a now discontinued official stockpiling scheme, under which farmers in the largest maize provinces were able to sell unlimited amounts into state reserves at guaranteed minimum prices. At the same time, cheaper feed grain imports flooded into southern consuming regions, choking off demand for locally produced maize. Authorities are now working hard to unwind part of these burdensome stocks. Under a plan jointly announced by 15 ministries and commissions in September, the government is seeking a massive expansion of the biofuel sector, targeting the blending of 10% ethanol (E10) into all automotive petrol by 2020. The move is seen as a part of broader efforts to reduce China's carbon footprint. If E10 plans are fully implemented, an additional 35-40m tonnes of maize would be required as a feedstock each year.
China's maize stocks are likely to be larger than previously thought
Calls for such a steep and sustained increase in China's maize consumption suggest that local inventories could be much larger than we had previously expected. Our supply and demand estimates for the past decade have therefore recently been revised, with forecasts for feed use across this period lowered by an average of 18m t/y, equivalent to around 10% of total annual consumption. Given the sheer size of its grain economy, any revisions for China can appear to have an outsized impact. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the underlying trend is unchanged from before, and with so much of China's grain economy operating separately from the global market, these revisions do not have any wider price implications. We forecast China's overall maize demand to rise by 4.3% in 2017/18, and by a further 5% in 2018/19, as maize use in industrial processing begins to accelerate.

Supply
World maize supplies (production plus carryover stocks) have increased to record highs in recent seasons, topping 1bn tonnes most years since 2011/12. Encouraged by high market prices, production gains have stemmed from increases in plantings, as well as improved yields, with growers using new seed varieties, fertilisers and better farming practices to great effect. After surging by an estimated 10.6% in 2016/17 to the highest level ever recorded, global output is projected to drop by 3.1% in 2017/18. Boosted by ample carryovers from 2016/17, global supplies are likely to remain comfortable, especially in the major exporting countries, where traders will compete for available business. Forecasts for 2018/19 remain highly provisional, especially in the southern hemisphere, and will be subject to revision in the coming months. Overall, we expect global output to be slightly lower in that season as a modest expansion in area is offset by lower yields.
A weak La Niña appears to be forming
Some of the world's leading meteorological agencies, including the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently indicated the presence of a weak La Niña weather event, which is likely to persist until February-April 2018. Previous La Niña events have sometimes been linked to drier than normal weather in southern Brazil and northern Argentina, two important maize producing areas. In contrast, La Niña normally brings beneficial rains to parts of southern Africa, a factor that lifted South Africa's 2016/17 maize crop to a record high.
US output will drop in 2017/18, but by a lower margin than expected
US maize production is officially estimated at 370.3m tonnes in 2017/18, almost 8% higher than the average annual outturn in the last five seasons. Although average yields were the best ever, at around 11 tonnes per hectare, output declined by about 4% from the 2016/17 record because of an overall drop in plantings. Although the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has maintained a generally optimistic outlook throughout the growing season, many other forecasters were more cautious because of poor weather earlier in the season. However, temperatures cooled in August, before warming again in September, thereby extending the growing period and helping to offset some of the effects of previous unfavourable conditions. The latest hybrid maize seeds, in combination with better farming practices and equipment, have allowed crops to perform well even under short periods of adverse weather. Planting decisions for 2018/19 will once again depend on price relationships with alternatives, mainly soybeans, in the spring. After two seasons of losing ground to soybeans, 2018/19 rotation needs could favour maize sowings, especially if fertiliser prices remain low. However, the current heavy maize supply outlook means that any upside is likely to be limited. For the time being, we expect a 2% rise in seedings, enough for a crop of around 361.8m tonnes, down by about 2% year on year.
Lower area and smaller yields in Brazil
Owing to low prices and extremely strong competition from soybeans, the full season 2017/18 maize area in Brazil is officially estimated to have declined by 10% year on year. Although sowings were completed a little later than usual in Minas Gerais, the top full-season producing state, recent rains have maintained generally favourable production prospects. Comparatively drier conditions have prevailed in Rio Grande do Sul, where farmers have expressed concerns about reduced yield potential. As overall productivity is expected to be lower than last year, nationwide production is on track to decline by as much as 18%, to 25.1m tonnes. This crop is, however, used almost exclusively to meet domestic feed needs in the southern livestock producing states, with very little typically used for export. The country's exportable surplus stems almost entirely from the second (safrinha) crop, sowings of which will start only after soybeans are harvested, usually from February onwards. Follow-through delays from late soybean planting mean that the planting window for safrinha maize is likely to be unusually short, raising the risk of crops entering pollination later in the year, when temperatures are typically hotter and soil moisture reserves are shorter. Because of low profitability at current market prices, a number of farmers could therefore be dissuaded from growing a second maize crop at all this year. Some land previously sown to safrinha maize may be switched into alternatives, including sorghum, sunflower seed or cotton, prices of which have held up well amid strong background demand. Taking into account the latest area, yield and production estimates from state forecasters in Mato Grosso and Parana, we have lowered our total 2017/18 crop estimate by 2m tonnes, to 89m tonnes, potentially a 9% year-on-year contraction. Nonetheless, with carryover stocks at close to 20m tonnes, marketing-year supplies could actually be even larger this season, with no threat to overall export availabilities. A return to more seasonal growing conditions in 2018/19 could see output recover to around 92m tonnes.
Northern Argentina is very dry
By the first week of January, about 78% of Argentina's next maize crop had been planted, about 5 percentage points behind the same point a year ago, and much slower than normal. Although seeding in the southern and central provinces was more or less complete, only about 10% of intended area had been sown in the country's northern maize growing regions. Delays have stemmed mainly from prolonged spells of very dry weather, consistent with the current weak La Niña, with many fields simply too dry to plant. Although showers in recent weeks have been useful, more rains will be required if average yields are to achieve the lofty levels seen in recent seasons. With planting in Argentina now stretching over an almost five-month timeframe, the dry conditions have also coincided with the key pollination period of the earliest-sown crops. There is still time to sow late-season varieties in the northernmost regions, but the optimal planting window in northern Buenos Aires province has already passed, and yield potential may now be limited should farmers still choose to sow maize.
Given the uncertainty about the final level of seedings and yields, it seems prudent to trim our production projections, especially as some weather models are predicting more dry weather to come. Output is now placed at 39m tonnes, down by 1m tonnes on our previous forecast, but 29% more than the recent average. Large carryover stocks from the previous season mean that exportable supplies will remain ample, easily big enough to cement Argentina's position as the world's third-largest exporter. Projections for the 2018/19 season are highly provisional at this stage and much will hinge on how the 2017/18 season turns out. In the light of the monthly reduction in Argentinian soybean export taxes planned for the next 24 months, there may be some renewed interest in producing oilseeds in the 2018/19 season, which could keep a lid on maize acreage. The production outlook at this stage is therefore static, pegged at about 40m tonnes.
South Africa's next crop is expected to be much smaller
After a bin-busting crop last season, exporters in South Africa have been unable to fully offload a very large surplus, resulting in a sharp build-up in stocks. With local maize prices under pressure, particularly for white maize, thin profit margins are expected to result in a 6% drop in 2017/18 commercial plantings. It has been a fairly dry start to the season, with fieldwork in parts of Free State province and in the western cropping areas hindered by below-average rains during much of October and November. Despite better rains in the first part of December, there was a lack of follow-up moisture across the north-west, where some farmers may be forced to plant alternatives, including sunflowerseed, which can be seeded a little later. However, owing to the local meteorological agency's expectations for normal to above-normal rains during the first five months of 2018, which coincide with the key yield formation stage of crop development, farmers will probably be keen to sow as much intended maize area as possible. Assuming that final yields are closer to average, we expect production to drop by almost 30% year on year, to 12.5m tonnes. As we currently predict very little change in planting intentions in the following year, a similar sized crop is expected in 2018/19.

Stocks and prices
Global maize stocks in 2017/18 are forecast at 335m tonnes, virtually unchanged from the previous year. Following a detailed reassessment of China's maize supply and demand numbers over the past decade, we recently raised our estimate of world stockpiles by 60%. Maize production in China is trending lower, and with consumption expected to rise strongly in the years ahead it has become clear that our previous forecast was too conservative and would have resulted in the depletion of China's stocks in just a few years. With feed use adjusted lower from 2011/12 onwards, projections for China's stocks were lifted across the whole period and are now forecast at 204m tonnes at the end of 2017/18, a figure much closer to that circulating in the local press. We now expect China to account for 61% of total world stocks (40% previously). Yet with so much uncertainty about the size, location and quality of its stocks, many analysts prefer to exclude China when modelling world inventories. Combined stocks in the four main maize exporters (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and the US) are forecast to remain above the recent average in 2017/18, at a total of 74.7m tonnes, up by 3.2% year on year, with more than three-quarters of these concentrated in the US. Mainly because of modest destocking in China, a relatively sharp drop is predicted in 2018/19, to 316m tonnes. Although exporter stocks will also tighten further, overall market supplies will remain at comfortable levels.
China's stock estimate is revised sharply higher
China's grain stocks have long been considered a state secret, with all parts of the grain balance sheet quite notional and based on limited information. Sometimes the assumptions are proven to be incorrect, as highlighted by new information or a change in underlying market conditions. Although our revised stock forecast diverges from those of the USDA and other major forecasting bodies, it brings stocks in China much closer to the levels that have been reported widely in the local press in recent years, including figures quoted by key policy advisers and other Communist Party officials. We expect stocks to be drawn down further in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry. However, given that these stocks are primarily held as a domestic food security measure, and with China being only a small importer, this is unlikely to influence global prices.

With consumption failing to keep track with the surge in supplies, US ending stocks are expected to rise for a fifth consecutive season by the end of 2017/18, reaching 62m tonnes, a 6.4% year-on-year gain. The stocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 20%, up by 4 percentage points from the season before and the highest since 2005/06, suggesting that supplies are very comfortable. Based on early projections for the next season, including another large crop and a marginal drop in consumption, carryover stocks are projected to decline by around 3m tonnes, to 59m tonnes, still well above average. After a series of huge US crops, a grain storage crunch has been reported in several states in recent years, with many farmers reluctant to sell at low prices. Kansas has faced a particularly acute shortage, partly because of producers switching area from lower-yielding wheat to maize crops. However, shortfalls have been noted in the traditional maize states of Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska too. Plastic silo bags have been a quick, low-cost solution for many growers, allowing grains to be stored cheaply directly on the farm. Although this offers logistical advantages, allowing farmers to avoid storage and handling fees, the maize being stored must already be at the desired moisture content and the silo bags still require active monitoring in order to avoid rupture losses.
Prices are unlikely to show any significant growth in 2018-19
World maize export prices have shown very little movement in recent months, with US fob quotations trading in a narrow, US$10/tonne range across the final quarter of 2017. Although occasional price support stemmed from heightened concerns about abnormally dry weather in parts of South America, overall gains were tempered by plentiful global exportable supplies, which were large enough to counter any production shortfalls south of the equator. The overall bearish market tone was highlighted by the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which confirmed that speculators held a massive net short position in futures and options at the start of 2018. Given background uncertainty about South American crops, there remains some upside risk to prices in the coming months. However, maize market fundamentals currently point to a low price environment, at least for the next year or so. We expect prices to rise slightly during the second half of this year; however, given ample global stocks and easy feedgrain availabilities, prices are likely to remain well below recent peaks in 2018-19.

Palm oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global palm oil consumption to accelerate over the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons, by 2.7% and 3.3% respectively. This is roughly on a par with the average growth rate in the past four seasons, but well below the peak, of 10.5% growth, seen in 2012/13. Palm oil imports are reportedly picking up in a number of countries as palm oil prices fall, making it more competitive compared with most other oils. However, negative sentiment against palm oil and palm oil-based biodiesel in the US and EU continues to weigh on demand there. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are looking to expand their exports; strong forecast consumption in China, primarily from its biodiesel market, is most likely to generate additional demand.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
In India, strong overall GDP growth in the coming seasons will help to support moderate growth in palm oil consumption. Nonetheless, changes in duties applied to imported palm oil will prevent faster consumption growth in 2017/18. India's imports grew quickly at the beginning of the 2017/18 season, but data for November-December show some tailing off of import activity. With stocks at ports at around normal levels, this suggests a moderation of consumer demand. As a result, we have revised down our forecast for India's overall palm oil consumption slightly, to 9.7m tonnes this season (9.8m tonnes previously). Nonetheless, this represents growth of 3.8% year on year, on a par with the average growth rate of the last five seasons. We expect demand growth to accelerate to 4.9% in 2018/19, encouraged by strong GDP growth.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post decent growth in 2017/18-2018/19
Prospects for palm oil demand in Indonesia have been encouraged by recent increases in forecasts of prices for mineral oil. However, the biodiesel industry in Indonesia is searching for new markets to make up for the loss of sales in the US. The recent implementation by the EU of reduced duties for Argentinian biodiesel is expected to be followed by a similar reduction for Indonesian biodiesel. A decision by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on EU anti-dumping duties on Indonesian supplies was due to be released by end-2017; the deadline has now lapsed, and the decision is likely to come in the near term. Recent data is consistent with our forecast of consumption growth of 6.6% in 2017/18, to a total of 9.8m tonnes. In 2018/19 we expect lower demand for biodiesel exports to limit Indonesia's palm oil consumption growth to 2.5%, to just over 10m tonnes.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by competition from soybean oil
Palm oil will continue to face strong competition from soybean oil in China in 2017/18. However, import data from the start of the 2017/18 season has been generally encouraging. We have increased our 2017/18 demand growth forecast to 5.2% (4.4% previously). This would bring total consumption up to 5.3m tonnes, well above the 2016/17 level, but still below average consumption of 6m tonnes each year from 2010/11-2014/15. Rising demand for biofuels underpins our forecast for another year of moderate demand growth, of 3.3%, in 2018/19.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
The market for palm oil in the EU has been broadly flat since 2013/14, hovering around 7.2m tonnes. At best we forecast only limited growth in the next two seasons. In the biodiesel sector, palm oil faces increased competition in some member states from recycled fats and oils, while sustainability concerns hang over medium-term consumption prospects. Palm oil imports in the season to date are marginally above year-earlier levels, although this is thought to be mainly to replenish low stocks. Changes in incorporation mandates may encourage higher biodiesel consumption in the EU over the next two years. While other feed-stocks are likely to be the main beneficiaries of this growth, palm oil consumption volumes should be maintained. Palm oil's use in the edible sector is also likely to be maintained but show minimal growth.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia faces challenges
Malaysian palm oil consumption was hampered in 2016/17 by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. These delays are unlikely to be resolved in the near future, despite government efforts to get the B10 mandate accepted by automobile manufacturers. Faced with rising domestic stockpiles, the Malaysian authorities temporarily suspended export taxes on crude palm oil in early January 2018, in an attempt to compete with other regional exporters. The high levels of domestic stocks fit with our forecast for only moderate domestic consumption growth, reflecting the sluggish growth for biodiesel in local markets.
Prospects for palm oil consumption in other countries are broadly positive
The geographical markets for palm oil are diverse, with the top five consumers accounting for less than 55% of global consumption. There have been sharp increases in exports to a number of these destinations including Pakistan, Iran, Philippines and a number of other Asian and African destinations. The largest of these "other" consumers, Pakistan, is likely to show sustained growth given that attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been largely unsuccessful. Buying activity from these other consumers is reported to be increasing, justifying a rise in the consumption estimate of for these "other" countries.

Supply
We have increased our forecast for palm oil production across the board in 2016/17, reflecting monthly output reports that have exceeded our initial expectations. We now expect global production to expand by 5.4% in 2017/18 (4.9% previously), to a total of 69.4m tonnes. In 2018/19 we do not expect yields to match those of 2017/18 as a result of tree stress and the lower use of inputs. Therefore, an expected increase in the mature area will be the main factor driving any growth in output. Overall, we expect output to expand by a modest 0.7% year on year.
Yields in Indonesia are slowly recovering from the 2015/16 drought
Indonesia's palm oil output has grown strongly since March 2016. This reflects both the recovery from the drought that had previously affected output, as well as the favourable age profile of Indonesia's oil palm plantings. There are now indications that this strong growth in output is moderating-a pattern that is likely to continue during the remainder of the 2017/18 season. While we have raised our 2017/18 production forecast to 37.7m tonnes, this represents seasonal growth of only 3.7%, far below the estimated growth of 15.8% achieved in 2016/17. In 2018/19 the larger mature area is likely to offset any negative effects from the slower rate of planting. However, yield growth is likely to be minimal reflecting both the strong yield growth in the previous two seasons and lower input use, given falling palm oil prices. We forecast output of 38.6m tonnes in 2018/19, up by 2.3% year on year.
Malaysian production is set to return to 2013/14 peak in 2017/18
Official data continues to show Malaysian palm oil output well above previous seasons. In October and November recorded ouptut was at least 20% above year-ago levels, and this trend is estimated to have continued in December. As a result, we have raised our forecast for Malaysia's prdouction growth in 2017/18 to 8.5% (7.5% previously). With an ageing tree population, yield growth will be difficult to achieve in 2018/19, especially given the continuing labour shortages and low international palm oil prices. Assuming a slight drop in average yields, we expect the total outturn to contract by 0.9% that season.
For Thailand, we expect an increase in the mature area to ensure continued growth in palm oil output in 2017/18, despite low prices inhibiting the use of crop inputs. Monthly output is running above earlier expectations, and we expect overall production to increase by 5.7% year on year in 2017/18. However, we forecast production growth to moderate in the 2018/19 season, to 2.4%; crop yields are likely to weaken in that season, as low global prices undermine the use of inputs, preventing faster output growth. In addition, difficulties in securing new land for planting will also act as a brake on potential growth. The slow growth in palm oil output is expected to result in a lower target for biodiesel use in Thailand. We expect Colombian output to grow steadily over the forecast period as its mature area expands. The recent peace agreement with the FARC may open up even more land for palm oil cultivation. Recent yields have largely been above year-earlier levels, and returns to the crop have been favourable. A higher biodiesel incorporation rate mandate should also help to maintain interest in the crop.

Stocks and prices
Recorded palm oil stocks in Malaysia and Indonesia have continued to increase. In Malaysia, inventories reached an estimated 2.7m tonnes at end-December 2017, a two-year high. Seasonal declines in production may provide some relief over the next quarter but the market surplus for the season as a whole is expected to be substantial. At the end of the 2017/18 season we expect that palm oil stocks will be similar to those at the end of the 2014/15 season, when measured as a share of average daily consumption. Our forecast suggests that stocks will continue to rise in 2018/19.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further in 2018
Like most other vegetable oils, physical prices for palm oil declined over the course of December 2017, as stocks rose quickly. Futures prices were also generally lower, despite a brief recovery in the middle of the month. Given the seasonal decline in palm oil production, which typically lasts until February, price falls during the first and second quarters of 2018 are forecast to be relatively modest. Price declines are likely to be more substantial in the second half of 2018 and early 2019. As global supplies remain comfortable, we expect average palm oil prices to fall to US$570/tonne in 2019, a low not seen since the end of 2015.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
Although mineral oil prices are rising, which would normally encourage higher rates of rapeseed oil consumption, this is being offset by the current high international prices for rapeseed oil. Rapid growth in rapeseed oil prices has started to ease in early 2018, but high global stocks will continue to inhibit new consumption. The Economist Intelligence Unit has raised its forecast for global rapeseed oil consumption in 2016/17, reflecting improved availability. However, we still expect consumption to have declined for the third consecutive year in 2016/17, by 3.2% (6.9% decline previously). We expect global rapeseed oil production to recover in 2017/18, which will support consumption growth of 5% that season-although overall consumption will remain below the volume seen in 2014/15-2015/16.
EU consumption limited by supply constraints
Rising imports of Argentinian biodiesel are already having a negative effect on EU rapeseed oil consumption in 2017/18. An expected resumption of Indonesian biodiesel imports in mid-2018 will also be problematic in the near term. In addition, sunflowerseed oil will continue to provide strong competition in the food sector. On the positive side, rising mineral oil prices in 2018 will be supportive of EU rapeseed oil demand. The recent tightness of rapeseed oil stocks has eased, improving the availability of rapeseed oil for consumption. Nonetheless, we still do not expect EU consumption to reach the 10m-tonne mark (last seen in 2015/16) during the forecast period. An increase in domestic production of rapeseed oil in 2018/19 should allow consumption to grow, by a modest 0.3%, as the competitive pressures on rapeseed oil persist.
Demand in China will be aided in 2018/19 by the release of reserve stocks
In China, limited stocks of rapeseed will exert negative pressure on potential consumption. Imports of rapeseed oil to date have been disappointing, although these have been partly offset by higher imports of canola for local crushing. We have revised down our forecast for 2017/18 rapeseed oil consumption marginally, reflecting recent import data. However, the consumption forecast is vulnerable to any change in price differentials between rapeseed oil and other oils. Recent falls in rapeseed oil prices, if maintained, will feed through into higher consumption. Any increase in consumption in 2018/19 relies on a recovery in local availability. Rapeseed remains a relatively unprofitable crop, and the planting area in 2017/18 was further hit by poor conditions. We expect the planted area to rise again to normal levels in 2018/19, which would allow a recovery in local availability, consistent with our consumption forecast of 5.8m tonnes.
India's consumption will rebound in 2017/18 in line with local availability
An improving outlook for domestic availability, together with strong real GDP growth levels, should stimulate rapeseed oil consumption in India in 2017/18. Demand levels will be vulnerable to changes in international rapeseed oil availability and competition from other oils. For now, we expect an improvement in availability, owing to stronger domestic purchasing power, to boost rapeseed oil consumption to around 2.6m tonnes on average in 2018-19. The main downside risk is related to gradual increases in import duties on vegetable oils, which could raise domestic rapeseed oil prices, dampening consumption growth.
Only modest demand growth is likely in the US market
Imports of rapeseed oil into the US continue to sustain consumption growth. Higher levels of Canadian production should stimulate further increases. The potential application of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia could stimulate additional demand for rapeseed oil as a feedstock during the forecast period. Overall, we expect US rapeseed oil consumption to continue to grow steadily, exceeding 2.9m tonnes in the 2018/19 season. Several smaller consumers switched away from rapeseed oil in 2016/17, and improving availability may encourage some consumers to buy additional rapeseed oil. Our estimate of 2017/18 consumption among these "other" consumers has been raised but still remains below the 2016/17 level. A recovery in consumption among the other consumers is now expected to be delayed until 2018/19.

Supply
An unusually large increase in the official estimate of Canadian canola production has had a significant impact on supplies of rapeseed and rapeseed oil. The estimate of Australian output is also higher. Overall, we now expect a global rapeseed crop of 65m tonnes, still well short of the record 70m tonnes produced in 2013/14, but larger than each of the last two seasons. We have raised our forecast for global rapeseed oil production slightly, to 24.8m tonnes in 2017/18. However, this still represents a modest decline year on year, of 0.4% (0.8% decline previously). If the rapeseed crop were to be larger than we expect, this would result in higher production growth of oil. Output in 2018/19 will, of course, depend on the level of rapeseed production. Early indications suggest that the crop size will be similar to that of 2017/18; this should help to improve global rapeseed stocks, boosting production of rapeseed oil by 4.8% year on year.
The EU rapeseed crop will recover partially in 2017/18
Our estimate of the size of the EU 2017/18 rapeseed harvest has been reduced to 21.8m tonnes, mainly on account of a reduction in the estimate for France. Import levels have been buoyant, most notably from Ukraine. Higher Australian estimates may mean that import levels are maintained in the latter part of the season. We continue to expect rapeseed oil output in the EU to easily exceed 10m tonnes in 2017/18; there is a chance that output will be even higher, depending on developments in the biofuel market. Reports suggest a small drop in winter rapeseed sowings in the EU despite favourable prices for rapeseed compared with wheat. Normal yields would be above those recorded in 2017/18 and would lead to a crop in excess of 22m tonnes. Our forecast of 2018/19 rapeseed oil production is maintained at 10.6m tonnes, up by 4.2% year on year.
China will rely on imports for oil production
The improved availability of canola from Canada and Australia has provided a boost to expected rapeseed oil production in China despite the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the domestic rapeseed crop. We now expect 2017/18 rapeseed oil production to reach 3.7m tonnes. Although this is above last season's output, it is well below the 2015/16 levels. It remains unclear whether Chinese farmers will expand the planted area for the 2018/19 season. It is more likely that higher rapeseed oil production for the 2018/19 season will require yet more imports. We forecast oil output to expand to almost 4m tonnes for 2018/19.
Canada's 2017/18 harvest will rise
According to the final estimate from Statistics Canada, the 2017/18 harvest will have risen to a record 21.3m tonnes, owing largely to an increase in the area planted to canola. In addition, yields were resilient in the face of earlier adverse growing conditions. We maintain our forecast that Canada's canola oil production will surpass 4m tonnes in 2017/18. There is an upside risk depending on the rate of export of canola to China, as well as the availability of markets for the oil. Despite recent price falls, canola remains an attractive crop to Canadian farmers. However, for 2018/19 we assume a reduction in the harvested area from the peak in 2017/18. Normal yields should allow Canadian canola oil output to rise to 4.2m tonnes.
India's production is poised for growth in 2016/17
In India, 2017/18 rapeseed production is forecast to remain well below 2016/17 levels. High temperatures and sporadic rainfall has caused a 10% drop in the rapeseed area according to recently published estimates. Growing conditions have also been adverse, putting a question mark over likely yields. We are using a crop estimate of 6m tonnes, marginally below that assumed in our previous forecast. Nonetheless, the comparatively high carry-in stocks of rapeseed will help local rapeseed oil production levels to be maintained, despite the smaller crop. We now expect that 2017/18 rapeseed oil production will approach 2.3m tonnes, before falling to around 2.2m tonnes in 2018/19, given the lower level of rapeseed carry-over stocks.

Australian production is likely to fall in 2017/18 owing to dry conditions
The 2017/18 canola crop in Australia has turned out better than previously expected. Most estimates now put the crop at about 3.2m-3.5m tonnes. The increase mainly reflects better than expected yields in Western Australia. Despite this recent upgrade, the crop remains well below the 4.4m tonnes harvested in 2016/17. In Ukraine, official estimates of the 2017/18 rapeseed crop put the total at 2.2m tonnes. With winter planting now ended, the area of winter rapeseed has further expanded, reflecting increased margins from the crop. Germination and crop condition levels are reportedly better compared with those in the past four years.
Stocks and prices
As a result of the upgrade to our 2017/18 production forecast, we now expect the global rapeseed oil market to be more or less in balance. In addition, current forecasts indicate that rapeseed stocks will return to almost normal levels. Higher crushing levels than currently forecast can be achieved, which could put the rapeseed oil market into surplus. By contrast, we expect the rapeseed oil market deficit to widen in 2018/19, with only limited scope to reduce this deficit with higher rapeseed crushings.

Low stocks will put upward pressure on prices from late 2017
Physical prices of rapeseed oil dropped significantly in December 2017, reversing the gains recorded in November. Futures prices for rapeseed and canola were also on a consistent downward trend during December. The increase in the Canadian production estimate has clearly changed market sentiment. With only the Indian crop to be harvested during 2017/18, this market weakness is likely to be maintained during the remainder of the 2017/18 season. On the other hand, stock levels remain at historically low levels, and current projections suggest that 2018/19 will see a return to market deficit conditions. Our expectation is that prices will drift lower through the first two quarters of 2018 but could then start to rise, assuming that current assessments of 2018/19 production are maintained. Prices will remain below US$900/tonne throughout the 2017/18 season but will rise above that level during the 2018/19 season.

Rice
Demand
With human consumption of rice continuing to drive up overall use in Asia, where populations are rising, global demand for rice is expected to increase by 1.5% in 2017/18, to a record 492m tonnes. As in the past, relatively small volume increases are likely in other regions, including Africa and South America. However, other components of demand, such as feed and the industrial sector, are expected to contract. The outlook for the 2018/19 season depends on factors that will remain unknown for quite some time, such as policy frameworks, local crop outcomes and import needs. As such, The Economist Intelligence Unit's projection of 1.4% annual growth, to a total of 499m tonnes, assumes that consumption growth will return close to trend.
Trade in rice will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2017
Africa and Asia account for three-quarters of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa particularly, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. With buyers in those regions expected to remain active in the global market, trade is projected to continue to grow in the next two years, to reach 45.5m tonnes in 2019, the largest volume on record. However, growth will be relatively marginal, as it is assumed that many Asian buyers are likely to be well stocked after the heavy purchases in 2017/18. Further strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. With those supplies having been disposed of, demand should taper.
China's needs are expected to be central to the rice trade in 2018-19
China is the world's largest consumer of rice by far, accounting for about 30% of global demand. The bulk of national consumption is made up of locally produced rice, but in recent years China has also become the biggest importer of rice, mainly of high-quality broken types from Thailand and Vietnam. Prices for domestic long-grain milled rice still command hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China, supporting China's import demand.
Lower duties will encourage rice imports by Bangladesh in 2018-19
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. Three domestic crops are cut each year, namely the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July) and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs are met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market. Bangladeshi importers and millers have sought to get tariffs reduced as a means of boosting imports, primarily from Thailand and India, with the latter typically the largest supplier in recent years. The country has recently entered into a long-term arrangement with Vietnam for up to 1m tonnes/year (t/y) of imports until 2022. Trade reports have also highlighted the possibility of significant purchases from Myanmar. The government is looking to boost rice imports to build reserves and rein in local prices after flash floods hit domestic output. To this end, the government announced a tariff reduction from 28% to 10% on rice imports in 2017.
The Philippines may be a large buyer, as state reserves are historically low
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in about a decade. By contrast, however, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain especially comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports progressed strongly in 2017, and are expected to reach 1.4m tonnes, up from 800,000 tonnes in the previous year. We anticipate that the Philippines will remain a significant importer in the future as it aims to ensure domestic supply.

Supply
We have raised our forecast for global rice production in 2017/18 to 489m tonnes-year-on-year growth of 0.2%, compared with a 0.2% fall in our previous forecast-narrowly surpassing the previous year's record owing to a marginal increase in area and solid yields. This comes despite a smaller outturn in the US and prospects for a reduction in output in India, largely by way of the country's main (kharif) crop. The outlook for 2018/19 is highly provisional. Nonetheless, given that only a small expansion of paddy plantings is likely, an increase in global output will almost certainly be dependent on better yields. At 496m tonnes, the world outturn is projected to be up by 1.5% year on year. All of our scenarios assume continued state support to farmers in Asia and beneficial weather conditions.
In India, where the kharif planting season was completed by early October, the area planted to paddy was slightly smaller year on year, but still fairly solid compared with the average of recent seasons. The 2017 monsoon was about 5% below the long-term average; taking into account its impact on yield potential in some regions, as well as prospects for the winter-sown rabi crop, we project total acreage to be broadly steady year on year. According to official data, 2017/18 rabi plantings were complete on 1.6m ha by end-December, up from 1.2m ha a year earlier.
Full-season production in 2017/18 is forecast at 107m tonnes, representing a small contraction year on year. Nevertheless, this should still ensure that availabilities for domestic use and exports are sufficiently comfortable. In 2018/19 the outcome will depend on the pattern of the monsoon, which will begin around June 1st.
India is expected to export 11-12m tonnes in both 2018 and 2019
Based on their continued robust pace to date, which has been supported by large ship-ments to Africa and South Asia, India's exports in 2017 are expected to have totalled 11.5m tonnes, the largest on record, making the country the biggest exporter for the sixth consecutive year. Shipments in both 2018 and 2019 are now anticipated to be of a similar size. In part, this stems from the likelihood that the country's exporters will provide even stronger competition to their counterparts in Thailand. This follows the conclusion of the Thai government's state reserves sales programme last year, which is likely to tighten attracively priced supplies for export. India's exportable surplus will be larger in comparison, despite the aformentioned fall in output in 2017/18.
China's exports in 2017 were the largest in a decade
Although China has emerged as the world's biggest importer of rice in recent years, it has, for the most part, been a tiny exporter. Over recent seasons its exports have fluctuated between 200,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes, with most heading to markets in Asia, including South Korea and Japan-these being part of minimum commitments to import by those nations under World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligations. Shipments normally comprise mostly small- and medium-grain varieties.
The current year has been different, however, with unusually large shipments of long-grain rice recorded each month, including particularly heavy deliveries to Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal and Sierra Leone. For 2017 in full, total imports, which are based on January-November data, are likely to have reached 1.2m tonnes, up from less than 400,000 tonnes in 2016 and the highest annual total in a decade. It is unclear whether such high sales can be maintained, especially since some of these shipments may have come in the form of food aid. Nevertheless, reports from the China Grain Network note that the heavy increase in exports reflects an acceleration of the disposal of excess rice stockpiles and describes the exports as a "structural adjustment". It is possible that shipments could be sustained at a similar level in coming years.
The government may lower minimum support prices for rice farmers
China is believed to sit on massive state reserves of rice, with some private estimates well in excess of 100m tonnes (on a rough weight basis). In addition to use of the international market to offload reserves, there has been speculation that the authorities are considering a reduction in government support prices for farmers, in order to facilitate a drop in output, and therefore stockpiles. Cutting support prices is also likely to result in a drop in imports by reducing the spread between low-priced supplies from Thailand and Vietnam, for example, and domestic rice, which is propped up by state support. In the period since 2012 China has entrenched its position as the world's largest buyer by some considerable distance, with purchases forecast to be at least 5m tonnes in 2018 and 2019. Given the potential for a lowering of state support to growers, we forecast only a modest increase in production during the next two years. Should the change be confirmed and significant, it would almost certainly result in a reduction in output and stocks.
Production prospects for 2017/18 in Thailand are positive
For many years Thailand was the biggest supplier of rice to world markets. However, a combination of its intervention buying programme in earlier years (beginning in late 2011) and heavy competition from India resulted in it losing that position. More recently, exports during 2017 were boosted by availability from the government's stockpile, but prospects for production will ultimately shape the country's exportable surplus over the next two years.
In the current season (2017/18), prospects for the main crop have been solid, with harvesting taking place in the latter stages of last year. Cumulative precipitation during 2017 is estimated to be around one-quarter higher than average, and the impact of flooding in September was minimal. Good water levels will also be important during the development of the irrigated, off-season crop, which will be threshed next year. Assuming that the planted area is expanded in both seasons, total production is projected at 20.5m tonnes, up from 19m tonnes in the previous year and a five-year high. A further increase in main-crop sowings is projected to push output up to 22m tonnes in 2018/19.
Exports of all varieties of rice totalled 10.5m tonnes during the January-November period and, with shipments of about 500,000 tonnes anticipated in December, total shipments in 2017 are estimated at 11m tonnes, up from 9.9m tonnes the year before. The strong increase was mainly due to a large expansion of shipments to markets in Africa, with a portion of these almost certainly being older state reserves. Since the government has now successfully sold off food-quality stocks from past harvests, exporters will not have access to attractively priced inventories that can be sold to buyers in Africa and other regions. Consequently, total exports in 2018 are expected to fall by 700,000 tonnes, to 10.3m tonnes, before edging up in the following year.
Vietnam faces competition from smaller and established exporters in Asia
Vietnam is a medium-sized rice producer but a major exporter. It typically accounts for 5-6% of global production but 15% of exports, making it the world's third-largest exporter behind India and Thailand. Vietnam's exporters have performed well in 2017, with bigger sales to a number of markets in Asia pushing up total volumes in January-November to a forecast 5.5m tonnes, around 25% higher than in the same period of the previous calendar year. Analysis of customs data show that, although exports to African nations were smaller year on year, China bought considerably bigger amounts from Vietnam, as did the Philippines, a long-standing traditional buyer.
However, a real boon for the nation was firm demand from Bangladesh, a country that has tended to source its import requirements from India. However, the need to build stocks after local supplies fell short meant that the government diversified its origins for imports. We expect Vietnam to maintain its position as the world's third-biggest exporter in 2018-19 and beyond, although volumes are unlikely to exceed 7m tonnes in any season, given continued heavy sales by India and Thailand, as well as growing competition from other, relatively small, exporters such as Cambodia and Myanmar.
A much smaller crop will constrain US rice exports in 2017/18
The US rice harvest was completed during October. Based on a heavy drop in plantings, production in 2017/18 is officially estimated to have fallen to just 5.7m tonnes, down from 7.1m tonnes in the previous season. This would be the smallest outturn in more than two decades, and is expected to tighten availabilities for sale on the international market, notwith-standing a drop in domestic use. Nevertheless, the contraction will be limited by large opening stocks. Shipments in the local marketing year, starting on August 1st 2017, are forecast at 3.3m tonnes, down from 3.4m tonnes in the previous year. US rice is sold globally, but major markets, mainly for paddy (rough rice) exports, include Central and Latin America, owing to proximity.

Stocks and prices
Reflecting adjustments to the historical data series in a number of countries, including China, by far the largest producer and stockholder, world carryovers in 2017/18 are significantly higher than in our previous forecast. Nevertheless, the underlying theme remains unchanged; at 107.7m tonnes, reserves are now expected to be slightly smaller in year-on-year terms. Moreover, although we expect China's supportive policies for farmers to ensure another rise in inventories, this will be in contrast to falls in the major global suppliers, as well as in other countries. Inventories held by the world's leading exporters, which include India, Pakistan, the US and Vietnam, are forecast at 22m tonnes, down by 5m tonnes year on year, but unchanged from December. This would be the smallest amount in a decade and highlights a global market that appears to be tighter than headline figures might suggest.
Stocks are expected to drop in the next two seasons on rising consumption
Despite rising global rice production in 2018, faster consumption growth will cut into global stocks, pushing them down to 107.7m tonnes. It is assumed that stockbuilding in China will continue, especially since imports are set to remain high, but exporters' reserves may fall once more, to just 21m tonnes, the bulk of which will be located in India. By contrast, Thailand's end-of-season reserves are likely to be much lower than in recent years, highlighting the government's successful programme of offloading old state reserves.
Trading in markets for export grades of white and parboiled rice in Asia has been fairly light and routine in recent months, underscoring the impact of a seasonal slowdown in many regions of the world. Highlighting this, the price of the benchmark 100% B grade in Thailand fell by 1% in the month to early January 2018.

In Vietnam, where exporters enjoyed a solid year, with shipments rising by more than 20% compared with the previous year, prices were up slightly. However, this was mostly linked to very tight supplies ahead of the main (winter-spring) crop harvest campaign. In India, where the focus is on the main kharif crop harvest, export values gained on demand from buyers in the region, principally Bangladesh, although similar increases in Pakistan were largely due to local markets and logistical difficulties.
The final quarter average price for Thailand's 100% B grade was US$391/tonne, a little higher than predicted and translating into a full-year value of US$390/tonne, only a fraction higher month on month. Accordingly, although we have made some historic changes to our base for stocks, the broader outlook is maintained from before. This results in only minor changes to our price forecasts moving forward. By the first quarter of 2020, we forecast a price of US$430/tonne and, although this would equate to a multi-year high-tied to a modest tightening of global stocks-it would still be well below the levels seen in 2009-13.

Soybeans
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global soybean consumption to expand by an average of 4.9% per year in our forecast period, to reach a total of 357.5m tonnes in 2018/19. This will be driven by rising demand for meat-and therefore animal feed ingredients, including high-protein oilseed meals-in China and many other Asian countries. Nonetheless, we expect growth to slow compared with 2016/17, when consumption rose by an estimated 6.1%. Looking beyond Asia, some smaller consuming regions, including the EU, Africa and the Middle East, will also contribute to rising demand. However, uncertainty regarding crop yields poses a downside risk to this forecast.
Trade volumes are nearly double their level from a decade ago
Partly reflecting stronger than anticipated demand in the latter stages of the 2016/17 trade year (ending September 30th), we have revised up our forecast for global soybean trade to 153m tonnes in 2017/18. This will be the seventh consecutive year of expansion, due mostly to rising demand from China, as well as some smaller markets in Asia. With demand from China and other smaller markets in Asia expected to increase again in 2018/19, global trade volumes could rise to another record of 159m tonnes.
Feed usage will drive overall demand up and will mostly be met by imports
China is by far the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans, with growth largely driven by expanding demand from the country's vast animal feed sector. In 2017/18 we expect China's total consumption to reach a new record of 107m tonnes, representing impressive growth of 8.1%, nearly one-third of the amount used globally. China's imports are forecast to total 100m tonnes, meeting more than 90% of its total soybean consumption. Although the government is looking to boost local output, it seems that imports will continue to account for the majority of overall requirements, especially in feed sectors. Most of what is produced locally is likely to be channelled to food and other smaller markets.
China's import demand has been robust despite reports of large stocks of soybeans and associated pressure on crush margins, with buyers encouraged by ample global supply and attractive prices. Therefore, although the outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, we expect another year of strong full-season purchases, of 104m tonnes. Nonetheless, the Chinese government's intention to end maize stockpiling, announced in 2016, remains a downside risk. The move aims to encourage the use of maize at the expense of other feed grains, possibly driving down imports of other grains, which have been imported in great quantities in recent years. Higher maize consumption in the pork and poultry sectors could also raise questions surrounding the use of high-protein meals, primarily soybean meal. However, the impact is expected to be marginal, as soybean meal is the most abundantly produced oilseed meal, and provides higher protein quality and nutritional value compared with alternatives.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
With another bumper crop expected to result in a further swelling of domestic supplies, US consumption in 2017/18 is forecast to remain close to the previous season's high, at 56m tonnes. Aside from local requirements, total use will be underpinned by rising exports of soybean meal. Similar trends will enable domestic demand to edge up in 2018/19, to 57m tonnes.
Soybean consumption in Argentina will also continue to be driven by growing international demand for soybean meal, of which Argentina is the dominant supplier. In Brazil, further increases in consumption are anticipated as bigger local soybean crops boost supplies for processing.
Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successive record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes, domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall requirements. The remainder is typically met by imports of soybeans and soybean meal, typically accounting for up to 35m tonnes. In 2017/18 soybeans imports are likely to rise after the previous season's fall, but any increase is likely to be capped in the future by a much better local rapeseed harvest; in 2018/19 and beyond, the availability of alternatives, including rapeseed, will play a crucial role in determining volume requirements. Throughout the period we expect the region's soybean meal imports to remain above 20m tonnes, making it easily the world's largest buyer of soybean meal (while China remains the largest buyer of soybeans).

Supply
A notable increase in the global planted area is expected in 2017/18, but the high yields achieved in 2016/17 are unlikely to be replicated. Accordingly, we forecast global soybean production to fall marginally, by 0.7% year on year, to 345m tonnes. Nonetheless, this is a slight upward revision from our previous forecast, owing to better prospects for the outturn in South America. In 2018/19 output could recover slightly, rising by a forecast 1.7% to nearly 351m tonnes, which would eclipse the 2016/17 record outturn. This reflects our outlook for a modest increase in area and trend yields.
US exports could be marginally higher in 2017/18, hitting a new record
At a record of 120.4m tonnes, US output was about 3% higher year on year in 2017/18. Together with high carryover stocks from the 2016/17 season, a crop of that size will ensure ample supplies for domestic use and export. US exports progressed strongly during the 2016/17 season, totalling 59m tonnes by August 31st 2017 (the close of the US marketing year), up by 5m tonnes from 2015/16. The solid pace was shaped by international demand from Asia, but also by a range of other importers, including smaller markets in Africa and the Middle East. For 2017/18 we expect shipments to expand to at least 60.5m tonnes, a new record. Although the pace of sales has stepped up significantly in recent weeks, these remained 14% behind those of a year earlier at end-December 2017.
US area is expected to remain broadly unchanged year on year in 2018/19
Planting intentions for the 2018/19 season in the northern hemisphere are tentative at this stage. In the US, much will depend on relative prices at the time of planting, as well as crop rotation. Although there is an argument in favour of increased corn plantings at the expense of soybeans following 2017/18 seeding patterns, support for soybean acreage could come from the recent growth in global trade, driven largely by China. We have adjusted our expectations of US soybean sowings in 2018/19, and now expect these to be broadly unchanged on the prior season. Overall, we tentatively expect the outturn to reach 118m tonnes, only marginally below the 2017/18 outturn.
A huge crop will be cut in Canada, with further increases likely in the long term
The area for harvest in Canada is estimated at a record 2.9m ha in 2017/18, an unprecedented year-on-year expansion of 33%, driven by expanded acreage in the non-traditional growing areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, largely at the expense of wheat and canola. One of the key attractions is that Canadian growers are able to tap in to a fast-growing global market. Added to this, the crop requires less intensive application of inputs, such as fertilisers, compared with alternatives, and new varieties have been developed that can be cultivated in areas that were previously unsuitable. Despite the significant expansion of seeded area, some reduction in yields was expected, especially as earlier reports from Manitoba and Saskatchewan pointed to difficulties with crop development owing to challenging weather conditions. Based on the recent official assessment issued by Statistics Canada, our estimate of total output has been lowered slightly, to 7.7m tonnes (from 8m tonnes), but this would still be easily the biggest crop on record, up by 17% year on year. Exports are projected to rise to 5.6m tonnes, up from 4.4m tonnes in the previous season.
Brazil's exports will continue to rise, supported by strong Chinese demand
Rising yields pushed Brazil's huge 2016/17 crop to record levels, positioning the country to export heavy volumes in the local marketing year (which closes at end-January 2018). Our forecast remains unchanged, and we believe that total shipments could reach a record of 67.5m tonnes in 2017/18, up by around 5.5m tonnes from the previous year.
Conditions for Brazil's developing crop improved in late 2017, following the arrival of beneficial rains in core areas. The only exception (in late December) was ongoing dryness in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The Northeast region of Brazil was also dry, although the situation was deemed to be easily recoverable after precipitation levels improved in January. Crops in Brazil are reported to be flowering and setting pods, and are in good condition in many areas.
Brazil's sowings will rise in 2017/18, given the ample available land
With plenty of land available, a further expansion of soybean area in Brazil, of 2% year on year to 34.5m ha, is expected in 2017/18. Nevertheless, downside risks remain. It seems likely that, despite area increases, some growers may have scaled back expenditure on essential inputs to minimise costs. However, maize prices in Brazil are signficantly below year-earlier levels-having fallen by a larger margin than soybean prices-which makes it likely that some farmers will have switched a portion of their intended primary, or full-season, maize cropland to soybeans. With yields set to be a little below the levels achieved in 2016/17, we forecast output to fall slightly in 2017/18, to 111m tonnes. Nevertheless, this is still a marginal increase from our previous forecast, due to favourable weather in recent weeks.
The government aims to resolve logistical obstacles to moving the crop to port
In the early months of 2017 heavy rains in Brazil caused the closure of the BR-163, also known as the "soybean highway", for quite some time, resulting in significant disruption to logistics on routes to Northern Arc ports. Mindful of last year's difficulties, the government is reportedly taking steps to avoid a poor outcome this time. The army will play a key role, and has done preliminary drainage work to keep unpaved sections passable. It will also respond to any problems that suddenly arise on the route during the course of the season. Planting of the 2018/19 crop will not begin until mid-September 2018, so the outlook is highly provisional. Based on further area expansion and trend productivity, output could be close to the 2016/17 high.
The ports on the Amazon River and along the north-eastern Atlantic Coast of Brazil are part of what is called the "Northern Arc" of ports in Brazil. Many of these ports are being expanded to handle increased volumes. A railway is also being planned from Mato Grosso to the more northerly Port of Miritituba, but completion will take many more years. BR-163 is thus the only major northbound highway, and completion of the paving project is therefore vital. The amount of grains and oilseeds moving along the northern highway will increase once the harvest has ramped up in Mato Grosso in January 2018, and industry stakeholders are encouraging the government to take action to avoid potential supply disruptions at ports.
Argentina's 2017/18 output could fall owing to area declines and dryness
Fieldwork for Argentina's 2017/18 crop is well under way and was estimated by the Bolsa Cereales to be 88% complete by January 3rd. According to the Bolsa Cereales, despite better progress in recent weeks, fieldwork continued to be hampered by hot and dry conditions, especially in northern regions. With the closure of the seeding window for soybeans (in mid-January), some areas, including in central and south-west regions of Buenos Aires, along with southern La Pampa province, could be left unseeded. In terms of yield potential, this will depend on whether beneficial rains arrive in the coming period. The critical time for the crop is during the pod-filling period-typically around February/March. With some area reduction now expected, and with a fall in average yields, production is projected to drop by 3.5m tonnes year on year for 2017/18, to 53m tonnes. Although the government is expected to reduce export levies gradually over the course of 2018-19, the crop is unlikely to be as attractive as other options.
China's output is rising, but still meets only a fraction of domestic demand
Despite being the world's largest importer by far, China is only a minor producer of soybeans. Its potential is capped by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players, as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, corn and rice. Nonetheless, in August 2016 the Chinese authorities published a National Oilseed Development Plan, which aims to boost domestic production to 60m tonnes by 2020. The scheme will provide support for oilseed production, processing, technical extension and innovation.
In 2016/17 total acreage was up by an estimated 10% from the previous season, and a further increase is likely in 2017/18, with a portion of land coming from the switching-out of corn production in north-eastern areas. Total output in the season is expected to rise to a peak of 14.3m tonnes, up from 13.1m tonnes in the previous year, and the same influences will underpin another increase in output, to 15.2m tonnes, in 2018/19.

Stocks and prices
At the end of the 2017/18 season global soybean carry-over stocks are forecast to reach a new record of 122m tonnes, with further accumulation in the US compensating for stock declines in other major producers. This should ensure that supplies in the world market are comfortable and, in the absence of a significant supply-side disturbance, that prices stay in check. Nevertheless, the nominal increase in stocks in 2017/18 (4m tonnes) would be much smaller than in 2016/17 (22m tonnes), when production soared. In 2018/19 prospects are highly provisional, but world inventories are expected to tighten, falling to 115m tonnes, although this is still large by historical comparison. Should conditions worsen in South America, we would revise down our stock forecast.
Looking below top-line data, US ending stocks (based on end-August 2018) are forecast to rise to 11.6m tonnes, up from 8.1m tonnes at the end of the previous season and the highest level since 2006/07. The bumper crop in 2016/17 helped to push stocks to this record level, despite growth in domestic consumption and exports. Inventory build-up in the US will help to offset expected falls in both Argentina and Brazil, where 2017/18 crops are likely to be smaller year on year in the face of high exports and local consumption.
World export prices for soybeans weakened in the month to early January, although activity was sometimes muted owing to seasonal holidays in a number of regions. Although international demand remained supportive at times, many leading buyers-notably China-are likely to have remained sidelined, awaiting new crop availabilities in Brazil. Earlier concerns about difficult weather patterns and the potential impact on crops in Argentina eased in some areas during December. Nevertheless, with some parts of Argentina still abnormally dry, and planting behind schedule when compared with a year ago, overall declines in international values were limited.

More recently there has been some support to US cash prices via strengthening export premiums, as freezing weather on important rivers in the Midwest led to tighter supplies at Gulf ports. There was even talk that some exporters were having to renege on original contract specifications owing to reduced availability. On January 4th US Gulf export prices for nearby shipment were quoted at US$373/tonne, a drop of 3% from the previous month, with new crop offers in Argentina and Brazil showing similar falls.
The 2017 fourth-quarter price averaged US$376/tonne, resulting in a full year value of US$377/tonne. Although there are some changes in the forecast, particularly in production and trade, the fundamental picture is broadly unchanged. Accordingly, we maintain our forecast for modest price growth through to early 2020. However, our production outlook rests on the assumption of normal growing conditions across the full season in leading producing countries. Should crops fall significantly short of expectations in any of the main exporters, especially in Brazil, there could be significant market support, pushing prices well above projected levels.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand by an average of 1.4% in 2017/18-2018/19 (October-September), roughly in line with the average over the past four seasons. Rising demand will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are adopting the food-and-drink habits of developed countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift, as a sweetener in food and beverages, and as a binding and preserving agent in processed foods. However, heightened awareness about the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put pressure on consumption growth, amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products. Moreover, owing to the growing supply of cheaper, starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market was liberalised in September 2017), a gradual shift towards these alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of relatively low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
Although its demand growth will ease, China will remain a key consumer
Rising urbanisation and changing consumer tastes will continue to spur demand for sugar in China, although we expect the rate of demand growth to ease in 2018-19, in line with a modest slowdown in overall GDP growth. Demand will also be held back by the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners, which are cheaper rivals to sugar in the beverages industry, and higher domestic sugar prices, which are a likely consequence of the government's moves to restrict imports. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government reduced permits in mid-2017 (to 1m tonnes/year-t/y-roughly half the previous level) and raised duties on out-of-quota sugar imports (from 50% to 95%). As a result, sugar imports fell by 24% year on year in January-November. Similar restrictions will remain in place in the coming years (albeit with the out-of-quota import tariff falling slightly over time), thereby constraining import demand. Nevertheless, China is unlikely to be able to scale up domestic production to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high levels of stocks. It will therefore continue to make purchases overseas, with the government timing its import decisions to coincide with favourable global prices or seasonal spikes in demand.
Consumption in India is forecast to recover as prices normalise
Potential consumption growth in India has been constrained in recent years by high post-drought prices and unsupportive policy moves (including demonetisation and the removal of some consumer subsidies). However, we expect demand to recover fairly briskly over the forecast period, rising from 0.8% growth in 2017/18 to 2% in 2018/19. The government raised import duties in mid-2017 (from 40% to 50%), but the near-term impact of protectionism on local prices will be muted by strong local harvests. Hence, as large domestic supplies from the 2017/18 crop hit the market, domestic prices will soften. This, together with rising incomes and further urbanisation, will support demand.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is positive. Demand in the more developed countries, such as Malaysia and South Korea, is likely to grow only slowly as markets mature, but this will be more than offset by demand in populous developing countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. However, demand growth in this region will be somewhat dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry to cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer) seeks export markets. Tax measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines could also dampen demand, with Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia pursuing plans to introduce a so-called sugar tax. This has the potential to put a sharp brake on demand; for example, the introduction of a sugar tax in Mexico in 2015 has contributed to a 12% drop in sugar demand since then. Nevertheless, we assume that any such policies in Asia will be rolled out only slowly over the coming years, amid concerns over restricting growth in the otherwise burgeoning food and drink manufacturing industries.
Health warnings may eventually dent sugar demand in the developed world
Demand growth in the mature EU market is likely to be sluggish in 2017/18-2018/19. Many EU countries already average far higher consumption levels of sugar than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), much of which is hidden in processed foods, and the EU Consumer Organisation is urging the food industry to take notice of WHO guidelines. So far, tax measures have been proposed to curb use in countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium. The policy response is likely to be watered down somewhat by opposition from the powerful food and drink industry, but consumer pressure is driving a gradual shift in the food industry towards lower sugar levels. More imminently, however, the liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farmgate prices and export caps were abolished-will limit the need for imports and bring European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. The production of isoglucose (a starch-based sweetener) was also liberalised in September 2017 and, as in the US, this is likely to steal market share gradually. As well as the adjustment to the new liberalised regime, the UK's exit from the EU is generating uncertainty in the European sugar industry, as the UK is the largest importer of EU sugar.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase, with the bulk of growth coming from rising local supplies that make sugar more affordable. Several consumers (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. But inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. A sugar tax will come into effect in South Africa in April 2018, but we expect the impact to be fairly minor, as manufacturers (particularly beverage companies) and consumers should be able to withstand the slightly higher cost. If this policy were to be replicated across the region, it would negatively affect demand in the medium term, but, amid considerable resistance from food and beverage industries, we think that this is unlikely.
Policy changes will shift the dynamics of the global sugar trade
The overhaul of EU sugar policy in 2017 is likely to have a significant effect on global trade patterns as the bloc transitions from being a net importer to becoming a net exporter. We expect this transition to be complete by the end of the 2017/18 season. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hit hardest by this shift. Global trade dynamics will also be affected by the introduction of heavy import tariffs in China, with small producers (exempt from the new tariffs) likely to increase their market share. Aside from China, trade patterns in Asia will be affected by the liberalisation of sugar sales under the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which comes into effect in 2018. This will probably cause less-efficient producers (such as Vietnam) to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade is also likely to increase in North America, following a trade deal between the US and Mexico that came into effect in July. This tightened the rules for Mexican producers and granted Mexico the right of first refusal for the US's above-quota import demand.
These trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by countries' preference for holding strategic stockpiles of sugar to hedge against future shocks. We therefore expect trade to increase in 2017/18 as countries (notably China) rebuild stocks after several years of low domestic production and relatively high global prices, before trade flows slow in 2018/19 on the back of large local harvests in markets that typically swing between net imports and net exports (notably India).

Supply
After fairly modest growth of 2.1% in 2016/17, world sugar production is forecast to increase by 7% in 2017/18, to 179.6m tonnes. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast (of 7.2%) as the latter part of the local season in Brazil, the world's largest producer, fell short of our expectations. Nevertheless, Brazil has still benefited from a second consecutive year of crop-friendly growing conditions in 2017/18 and, with a significant amount of output locked into generously priced forward contracts, the supply of cane to sugar production will remain above average. Global supply will also be supported by strong crop revivals in India and Thailand, following weather-related shocks during the previous harvest, and strong output growth in the EU as producers seek to capitalise on the newly liberalised sugar regime. In 2018/19 we expect global output to remain fairly flat, with growth of just 0.8%, as a slowdown in Brazil is offset by growth among most other producers. This is, however, contingent on normal weather conditions, and even fairly modest disruptions to rainfall patterns pose significant risks to the forecast.
Output growth in Brazil is in prospect as cane supply increases
Brazil is on course for a strong cane harvest, with volumes surpassing market expectations in the early months of the local 2017/18 season (April-March) and quality deteriorating only slightly as the harvest has progressed. In the latter part of the season, however, mills have closed earlier than we had expected in the crucial Centre South region (which produces some 90% of Brazilian sugar) owing to wet weather and rising ethanol prices. This has caused an unusually high proportion of cane to be diverted to biofuel production at the expense of sugar. Mills had favoured sugar production over recent years, as ethanol demand waned during a period of low oil prices and weak economic growth. However, the government reduced a federal ethanol tax in mid-2017 and this, together with rising oil prices (which boost demand for biofuels), will draw in more cane.
Even so, the overall diversion of cane to the sugar industry in 2017/18 will still be above historical norms of 44%. We therefore expect sugar output to reach 39.4m tonnes in 2017/18; this is up from an average of 37.7m tonnes over the past five years but is a slight downward revision on our previous forecast owing to dynamics in the Centre South. In 2018/19 the weakness of the Real will support the attractiveness of the export-oriented sugar industry, but higher global oil prices and a modest economic recovery in Brazil will spur demand for biofuels. These counteracting factors will probably leave ethanol and sugar prices close to parity, and this is likely to bring the diversion rate in line with historical norms. Moreover, sugarcane fields are ageing and field renewal rates are low. This will begin to take a toll on cane output from 2018/19, thereby reducing the overall cane crush. With a less favourable diversion rate and lower cane production, sugar output is therefore forecast to moderate to 38.3m tonnes in 2018/19.
Strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
Production in India is poised for a strong recovery following drought-related supply disruptions in 2015/16-2016/17. We expect output to reach 26m tonnes in 2017/18 on the back of an expansion of the crop area under cultivation and stronger yields. In 2018/19 planting will be encouraged by decent farmgate prices in the previous season, while the wider use of high-yielding seed varieties will boost output. Limited crushing capacity will probably keep output below official projections of 30m tonnes, but we expect a second year of strong production in 2018/19. High production levels will, however, put pressure on sugar prices. Low domestic sugar prices, together with higher state-imposed ethanol prices from December 2017, as the government seeks to develop a biofuel industry, could lead to the diversion of cane away from the sugar industry. However, with ethanol production still costly and cane in plentiful supply, we doubt that rising ethanol production will have a significant impact on sugar output in the near term. Moreover, the draft biofuel policy restricts the diversion of cane to ethanol production to years of surplus production, which should mitigate the medium-term threat to sugar output.
EU production will recover as the sugar regime is liberalised
In Europe, sugar output is poised for brisk growth as producers seek to take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system. Under the new regime, which came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 season, producers (led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries) will extend their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity without significant additional investments. This will be supported by higher supplies of beet, with some integrated sugar companies reporting that the area under cultivation has been increased by 15% year on year in 2017/18. Weather conditions have also been favourable, with the authorities in France projecting a record high harvest in 2017/18. Higher supply and greater efficiency should also leave the region's main producers able to withstand lower prices as the price of European sugar falls closer to the global average. We expect EU production to reach 18.8m tonnes in 2018/19, which will surpass EU demand and spur export growth.
In Russia, sugar production is expected to remain robust, following significant investment in the modernisation of sugar factories in recent years. Output since the start of beet processing in August has been strong (up by 13% year on year in mid-November), aided by favourable crop-growing conditions. The ensuing surplus will support Russia's emergence as a notable exporter as the government seeks to prevent stock build-ups from depressing domestic prices and deterring planting. However, we think that the authorities' forecast that exports will reach almost 1m t/y is overoptimistic, owing to soft demand for imports in Central Asia (Russia's main market) and the country's limited output of high-value sugar (which is in higher demand globally).
Output in Thailand is recovering from El Niño's long reach
In Thailand, favourable rainfall will support a bumper harvest in 2017/18 of 11.9m tonnes. Assuming that rainfall normalises in 2018/19, we forecast a more moderate, albeit still decent, outturn of 10.5m tonnes. The industry is facing a regulatory overhaul, after Brazil successfully argued that Thailand was violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free competition. The Thai govern-ment aims to introduce legislation to liberalise the sugar industry in early 2018, despite fierce resistance from manufacturers. Most importantly, this will phase out quotas for sugar production and revoke the domestic price-fixing system. Mills are, however, still obliged to reimburse farmers if the final sale price drops below a pre-agreed price, and this should offer farmers some protection from global volatility. Liberalisation is likely to lead to some consolidation of the industry, but we continue to believe that total production will expand. Increasing mechanisation will help to boost yields, and the sugarcane area will grow as farmers turn away from less profitable rice crops. Moreover, producers will be incentivised by export opportunities to other Asian markets, where demand is rising and Thai sugar enjoys favourable access under the ASEAN free-trade arrangement. However, weather-related risks to our Thai forecast are rising as production moves towards more drought-prone interior regions.
A major recovery in China's sugar sector appears unlikely for now
China's sugar output fell sharply in 2013/14-2016/17, owing to unfavourable weather and the impact of rapidly rising costs for labour, land and farm machinery. Amid political pressure from the local industry, some government support has been forthcoming in the form of input subsidies and soft loans, and the government has raised duties on out-of-quota sugar imports in a bid to protect local producers from cheaper imports. These measures will support the profitability of the local industry and should spur some investment, but we doubt that they will lead to a significant surge in domestic supply growth. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high and sugarcane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. Indeed, the cost of producing sugarcane in China is almost double that in Thailand, and this will deter investment. Owing to more favourable growing conditions, we expect output to rise modestly, to an average of 10.4m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19, but this is well below the 10% annual growth that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals.

Stocks and prices
After successive supply deficits and a period of relatively high global prices, global sugar stocks shrank to 87.4m tonnes at end-2016/17. We expect stocks to recover to 98m tonnes by end-2018/19 as the market swings back into surplus. The market surplus is forecast to reach 6.1m tonnes in 2017/18, amid bumper harvests from key producers, before moderating to 4.5m tonnes in 2018/19 as output remains flat and consumption accelerates slightly. Although overall stocks will remain comfortable (equivalent to an average of 54.7% of annual consumption in 2017/18-2018/19), the uneven distribution of these stocks means that reserves will not always be available to the market, and occasional supply squeezes are possible.

Prices will drift higher, but slowly and from a low base
After peaking at over 23 US cents/lb in late 2016, global sugar prices fell by 30% over the first half of 2017, before stabilising at about 14.4 US cents/lb in the latter half of the year. In part, this reflects a market correction after overshooting, with speculative investors unwinding the long positions that they had adopted during the price boom. More fundamentally, crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets are fuelling expectations of a global sugar surplus in the coming years, and policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably, China, India and Europe) have further weakened market sentiment.
After having fallen sharply in late 2017, we expect sugar prices to drift higher from this low base over the course of 2018-19. This modest price recovery from the nadir of mid-2017 will be driven partly by market tightening from 2018 as the crucial Brazilian market diverts more cane to ethanol production over the coming years and therefore produces less sugar. A swing to ethanol that is substantial enough to bring the global sugar market into balance seems unlikely, however, and the prospects of global oversupply will probably prevent a more significant rebound in prices. Our forecast of a modest price recovery is also based on the expectation that the sugar trading market will gradually begin pricing in more risk, after prices dropped so low in 2017 that they effectively excluded a risk premium. With traders still seemingly taking their price cues from the expectation of a global surplus in 2017/18, we have revised down our price projection for early 2018. But as crude oil prices rise and the sugar market tightens, we expect a rising risk premium to provide some support to prices. Sugar prices are therefore forecast to average 15.5 US cent/lb in 2018 (a downward revision to our previous forecast of 16.1 US cent/lb, due to the expectation of lower prices in early 2018), before hovering at about 16-16.5 US cents/lb in 2019.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Global demand for sunflowerseed oil remains fairly strong, owing in part to its attractive pricing compared with other oils. Nonetheless, The Economist Intelligence Unit has revised down its forecast for global demand growth in 2017/18, to 2.2% (2.8% previously), reflecting concerns about availability. Sunflower-seed oil enjoys positive consumer perceptions in many countries, and this underpins our expectation of further consumption growth in 2018/19. We forecast global consumption growth to pick up to 4.1% that season, to a total of 19.4m tonnes; this forecast assumes that sunflowerseed oil will maintain its competitive position against the price of other oils.
Sunflowerseed oil's improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
Although the gap narrowed slightly in late 2017, sunflowerseed oil continues to be traded at a historically large discount to rapeseed and soybean oils. Partially as a result, consumption remains buoyant in the EU. We expect regional demand to rise by another 2% in 2017/18, buidling on remarkable (estimated) growth of 15.1% in 2016/17. However, this level of consumption implies a modest decrease in imports of sunflowerseed oil compared with the previous year. Assuming that imports pick up again in 2018/19, supported by sunflower-seed oil's favourable consumer image, demand could expand by 4.3% that season.
Russian consumption will rise modestly as the economy emerges from recession
In Russia, lower production estimates will cause local availability to tighten in 2017/18. This is likely to be reflected in higher local prices; we expect this to hinder demand growth in 2017/18, which we have revised down to a marginal 0.4% year on year (1% previously). In the 2018/19 season we expect consump-tion growth to pick up to 4.7% year on year, encouraged by slightly faster GDP growth in 2018 and 2019.
Robust GDP growth and shifting preferences will boost India's usage
Indian imports of sunflowerseed are continuing to run at high levels despite the imposition of higher import tariffs. Internal Indian prices show sunflowerseed oil to be increasingly competitive with other oils. The growing consumer preference for sunflowerseed oil, especially in the south of India, and sustained economic growth should also be positive for demand growth. We expect 2017/18 consumption to rise by 8.2%, to over 2.3m tonnes, followed by further growth of 3.7% in 2018/19.

Consumption growth to moderate in "other" countries in 2017/18
Many countries have been increasing their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Countries increasing their use of sunflower-seed oil include Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, as well as several smaller countries. With more uncertainty over 2017/18 supplies, some of these countries are reducing their purchases. We have reduced our expectations of consumption growth in these "other" countries to 1.2% in 2017/18 (2.2% previously).
Supply
The estimates of the 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop have mainly been revised downwards compared with our previous forecast. Lower estimates for Russia and Argentina are only partially offset by a higher EU estimate. Despite the reductions, the global harvest will still be a large one by recent standards although significantly below last season's record output. With comparatively low carry-in stocks of seeds, we expect production of sunflowerseed oil to contract by 2.5% year on year in 2017/18, to 18.4m tonnes, from 18.9m tonnes in 2016/17. Early indications suggest another large harvest in 2018/19, supporting growth of 3.3% in sunflowerseed oil production. In addition, the size of the crop would allow some rebuilding of stocks to more normal levels.
Crush rates to slow as the season progresses
Ukraine's sunflowerseed crop has failed to live up to early estimates for the 2017/18 season; we maintain our forecast that the outturn will reach 13.2m tonnes. However, with relatively plentiful sunflowerseed stocks carried over, this is not likely to have an immediate impact on crush rates. Indeed, exports of sunflowerseed oil in the year to date from the Ukraine have been running above year-earlier levels, encouraging continued high levels of crushing. However, it is expected that crush rates will slow as the season progresses and as seed stocks are worked through, reducing availability and therefore crush volumes. Official statistics reported that sunflowerseed stocks were lower by 11.5% at the start of December 2017. Although the outlook for 2018/19 is provisional, some local observers have raised concerns that falling profit margins will act as a disincentive to farmers. However, given the industry's strong expansion in recent years, we maintain our relatively optimistic view. At this stage, we assume an unchanged area which, with normal yields, would result in a crop of 14.7m tonnes. This would provide sufficient raw material to push sunflowerseed oil output in 2018/19 to 6.1m tonnes-below the record outturn in 2016/17 but still up by 5% from 2017/18.
Sunflowerseed crush rates contingent on availability
In Russia, official reports suggest that 13% of the sunflowerseed crop was unharvested in mid-December, compared with less than 5% a year earlier. As a result, we have further reduced our estimate of the final outturn to 11m tonnes, with risks primarily on the downside. Sunflowerseed crush rates will be affected by the lower availability-we have therefore reduced our forecast for sunflowerseed oil production to 4.4m tonnes in 2017/18 (4.6m tonnes previously). In 2018/19 we expect that the sunflowerseed area will be similar to 2017/18. Normal yields would give a record crop of more than 12m tonnes. Sunflowerseed oil production could reach almost 4.9m tonnes in 2018/19, provided that sufficient markets can be found.
Estimates for the EU sunflowerseed harvest in 2017/18 have improved
There has been a further small increase in our estimate for EU sunflowerseed production in the 2017/18 season, reflecting a higher estimate for Spanish production. With sunflowerseed production almost 1m tonnes higher than 2016/17, we expect sunflowerseed imports to fall and EU crushing volumes to rise compared with the previous year. We forecast EU sunflowerseed oil production to reach 3.5m tonnes in 2017/18 (3.4m tonnes previously). Sunflower-seed sowings for 2018/19, which start in the spring, are expected to be marginally lower than in 2017/18. At this level, a potential crop of more than 9m tonnes is in prospect. Sunflowerseed oil production could approach 3.5m tonnes.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain good, but downside risks are mounting
In Argentina the 2017/18 sunflowerseed area has expanded by around 10% year on year. Yet growing conditions have been relatively unfavourable, with conditions too dry, and assessments of the likely harvest have been reduced to around 3.7m tonnes. Despite the reduction, if achieved this will be the largest crop in the last decade. We continue to expect that sunflowerseed oil production will exceed 1.4m tonnes in 2017/18 and reach 1.5m tonnes in 2018/19. Export availability of sunflowerseed in 2017/18 will also be higher than in 2016/17, even with the reduced crop estimate.

Stocks and prices
Stocks of sunflowerseed oil remain plentiful, and this situation is likely to persist for the 2017/18 season, despite the fact that we forecast a small deficit in the global market in that season. That position will only be achieved by running down sunflowerseed stocks, which may consequently turn out to be overoptimistic. Current projections suggest a recovery in sunflowerseed stocks in 2018/19, which may encourage crushers to maintain activity during the latter part of the 2017/18 season. Nonetheless, as consumption expands at a relatively firm pace, we expect the global market to remain in deficit in 2018/19.

Upward pressure on prices will be felt in the coming months
Sunflowerseed oil prices retained their value in December despite falls in the prices of other vegetable oils. Clearly, the reductions in production estimates were enough to raise concerns about future supplies, keeping a floor under prices. As the market moves into deficit in 2017/18, we expect prices to trend upwards. Nonetheless, with ample global stocks in place, price gains are likely to be modest. We forecast growth of 4.3% in sunflowerseed oil prices in 2018, followed by stronger growth, of 7.2%, over the course of 2019.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for one-third of world tea consumption and is consuming ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is also growing in other major consuming regions, including India. Demand for tea is less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities owing to its low cost, implying that tea demand is mainly driven by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast for tea consumption growth, of 3.8% a year on average in 2018-19, is relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since tea consumption is determined by structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages. Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, particularly driven by its increasing popularity in China, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and "ready to drink" tea beverages account for a small share of the tea market but have enjoyed rapid growth in sales-even in traditional markets such as China.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are also the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption (this explains why many producers are trying to boost output, in an effort to raise exports). In producing countries, tea will benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places will remain a consumer staple. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partly to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2017-18
Tea consumption will remain dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 57% of global demand in 2017, up from 48% in 2010. In China, we expect the government's efforts to rein in credit growth to contribute to a managed economic slowdown from 2018; nonetheless, this will have only a muted impact on tea demand growth, which is forecast to rise by 4% per year, compared with 5% in 2017. This forecast is relatively cautious, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projecting average annual Chinese demand growth of 15% until 2024, suggesting an upside risk to our forecasts. Average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China just 14th in the world. This leaves room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drinks tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Other changes in consumer habits will also affect tea sales, with greater demand for teabags globally (these are less wasteful than loose-leaf tea). However, given the importance attached to the quality of tea, sales of leaf teas will continue to dominate the local market.
In India, strong economic growth will be accompanied by higher household spending, firm consumer confidence and supportive demographics, driving annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2018-19, marginally lower than estimated growth of 6.5% in 2017. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently, the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share, as well as fuelling overall tea consumption growth.

Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2018-19 by market saturation and weakening demographics. The FAO forecasts an overall contraction until 2024 in many EU markets (which together account for just under 5% of global consumption), despite a firmer economic performance, as well as in Russia (2.5% of global consumption). Turkey, which also accounts for around 5% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting continued population growth and steady growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. We forecast average annual growth in tea demand in 2018-19 of 1.9% in the EU and 0.4% in Turkey. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.5% per year, but is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consump-tion in 2013-16.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for less than 2.5% of global consumption, and consumption per head is low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea. It also remains one of the world's largest tea importers. We expect demand to increase by an annual average of 2.6% in 2018-19, partly reflecting our fairly upbeat forecast for economic growth. Health concerns will also sustain demand for tea, with a gradual shift away from carbonated beverages towards healthier alternatives.
New tea markets are emerging
Export data from tea-producing countries reveal that new markets for tea are emerging, with the number of countries buying tea at the major auction houses in Asia and Africa on the rise. Demand from these new joiners in the tea market, mainly fast-growing emerging countries, is set to increase in 2018-19, underpinning our forecast for average consumption growth of 2.5% a year across all "other" countries, which together account for 18% of global consumption.
Supply
We estimate that global tea production contracted by 0.6% in 2017-the first fall in output since our data series (which is based on historical data from the FAO) began in 2000. Nonetheless, this is an upward revision from our previous estimate (of a 1.7% drop), as Kenya's tea production improved markedly in late 2017. We expect global production to rebound in 2018-19, rising by an average of 2.8% per year. Yet, these growth rates remain weak by historical comparison; annual growth in tea output averaged 4.4% during 2004-14. Along with weather-related concerns, several structural factors will prevent faster production growth. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades owing to the higher cost of inputs, resulting in a fall in investment. In addition, many local currencies will remain comparatively weak against the US dollar in 2018-19, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers. It looks increasingly likely that a La Niña weather phenomenon will develop in the coming months: this can bring unusually cold temperatures to some Chinese tea-growing regions, drought to Kenya and very wet conditions to Vietnam. Depending on how weather conditions develop (currently it looks set to be a comparatively weak La Niña, which may well have a minimal impact on tea production), this has the potential to lead to another year of declining output.
Much of the forecast growth in 2018-19 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects rising production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, up from 43% a decade ago. We expect these trends to continue in 2018-19.
As in 2016, adverse weather will harm Chinese tea production in 2017
China experienced the second year of disappointing tea production growth in 2017. We estimate that output expanded by 2.2%, after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, in June. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which probably hampered production.
We expect tea production growth to pick up to an annual average of 3.7% in 2018-19. The government's focus on eliminating rural poverty is likely to improve farmers' access to credit from the Agricultural Development Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit co-operatives. Coupled with more supportive underlying weather conditions, these efforts are likely to lift tea production more substantially than in 2017. Structural efforts on the part of the authorities to lift product quality and quantity in order to boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016) will also bolster output. Given that China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 801 kg in 2014-16, compared with 2,153 kg in India and 2,088 kg in Kenya), there is certainly potential for gains in productivity.
India's tea production will continue to grow slowly in 2018 and 2019
We estimate that tea production rose by 1% in India in 2017. Output fell in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state), as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India, but weather conditions improved subsequently. Assuming supportive weather conditions in 2018-19, we expect tea production to continue to rise, albeit gradually. Continued efforts to channel funding to tea growers will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly and rising input costs have eroded profits, implying that in the long term India may struggle to increase growth as significantly as other major producers. We forecast average growth in tea production of 1.6% per year in 2018-19.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
We estimate a double-digit decline in tea output in Sri Lanka in 2017, reflecting torrential rain that caused landslides and the worst flooding in over a decade. Many of the 400,000 farmers, who account for 70% of national tea output, saw their bushes submerged by muddy water. Sri Lanka's tea production is forecast to rise in 2018, by 5.8%, but this will largely reflect a cyclical recovery after several disappointing years. As in India, there are several structural hurdles that will hamper growth, assuming that weather conditions improve. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not sufficiently high to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. Local reports also show that fertiliser use has been low, and the risk of industrial unrest persists. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. These factors explain why our production growth forecast in 2019, of 1.8%, is relatively weak.
A partial recovery in output is likely in Kenya in 2018-19
After a massive jump in tea production in Kenya in 2016, with output hitting an all-time high of 473,000 tonnes, weather conditions deteriorated sharply in the first three quarters of 2017, with a renewed and persistent dry spell damaging tea plantations. However, despite forecasts of further bad weather in the fourth quarter of the year, with heavy rains and flooding feared to hit tea production and deepen the already sharp decline in output, weather conditions ended up being much more favourable than had been projected in the latter months of the year. This led to a significant increase in tea production in October and November, with output about 50% higher than had been recorded mid-year. On a year-to-date basis this reduced the fall in tea production to 8.3% in the first eleven months of the year, compared with a drop of over 35% earlier in the year. We have adjusted our full-year estimate to a contraction of 11.2%, compared with about 30% previously.
Tea output will rise gradually in 2018-19, by an annual average of 3.3%. Periodic industrial action in the sector over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers, so that it is based on the value rather than the volume of sales, will undermine profitability and prevent more rapid output growth. Although the government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, conflicting interests and a lack of funds will hinder progress.

Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes three to five years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact on output of recent price falls will be evident only after the forecast period.
Stocks and prices
We estimate a fourth consecutive year of market deficits in 2017, reflecting increasing consumption and a contraction in output from several of the main tea-producing countries. We expect consumption growth to outstrip production growth during 2018-19, meaning that we forecast deepening market deficits in those years.
Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge how significantly these widening market deficits will affect stock levels. The fact that prices fell during 2015-16 despite market deficits in both years indicates that stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output in China, which mainly consists of green tea. Although some of the production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.

Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya, respectively (essentially, black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. As an example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions rose sharply in 2017, by 25% and 22% respectively as production fell, while prices at the Kolkata auction rose by a much more muted 2% year on year. Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes (there is no futures market). Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat slightly in 2018-19
After averaging US$3.11/kg in 2017, a 17.8% year-on-year increase, recovering production is expected to reduce prices by 3.4%, to an average of US$3/kg in 2018, and by a further 6.3% in 2019, to US$2.81/kg.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has nearly tripled since the 1960s, to more than 700m tonnes in recent years. Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been tied to a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has persistently outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and for the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global consumption to rise marginally, by 0.9%, to 741m tonnes in 2017/18. Although wheat use for food is expected to increase in line with the recent trend, it appears likely that world feed consumption will decline, owing partly to competition from alternative products. A similar pattern is expected in 2018/19. Although use for feed is expected to slip back further, a rise for milling and food use should see total demand increase by 0.3%, to 743m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in global food-wheat consumption has remained relatively consistent over the past decade, with increases averaging 1.4% a year. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods such as noodles, as well as Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports in most years. We expect world food use to rise by 1.5% in 2017/18, exceeding 500m tonnes for the first time. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa. These trends are well established and are expected to continue into 2018/19, when food consumption could rise to 511m tonnes.
World livestock feed use to fall in 2017/18
Wheat is the world's second most important grain for use in animal feed, although it is typically equivalent to one-quarter of feed-use of maize, with annual wheat use roughly matching that of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. Assuming strong competition from maize-especially in the EU, China, and the US-we expect use for livestock feed to fall back by 3.7% year on year in 2017/18, to around 144m tonnes and remain at similar levels in 2018/19. The drop stems mainly from a projected small decline in Russia, where a smaller crop is likely to limit discretionary on-farm feeding. Feed use in Canada is also forecast to be sharply lower than in 2016/17, dropping by about half, to 3m tonnes, on much smaller feed grade supplies.
Russia's feed industry has expanded quickly
Spurred by a series of government support measures aimed at boosting domestic meat production, Russia's feed sector has undergone massive changes over the past decade. With particularly sharp expansion in the poultry and pork sectors, overall feed use is estimated to have increased by as much as 10% per year over the decade, with growth now reported to be stabilising. The trend is likely to continue given that the country is now targeting its own meat export programme in the medium term. Because of its reliance on domestic ingredients and large local availability, grains account for a relatively high proportion of feed, seen by some industry watchers at as much as 70%. While wheat is the most important feedgrain in Russia, large amounts of barley, maize and oats are also used in compound feed rations and for on-farm feeding. Total wheat consumption is forecast at 45m tonnes in 2017/18, with 21m tonnes expected to be used for feed, 4m tonnes more than the previous year. For the following year, total use is predicted to drop back to around 42m tonnes, as a smaller local crop will limit discretionary on-farm feeding and, consequently, feed consumption.
Consumption is rising quickly in Sub-Saharan Africa
Wheat demand in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased relatively quickly in recent years, owing to rapid population growth. Wheat-based foods have gained in popularity over traditional staples such as maize porridges, cassava and millet. Higher incomes, migration to cities and more women participating in the workforce have contributed to greater demand for convenience-and often wheat-based-foods. With climatic conditions in most countries unsuitable for producing wheat except for a select few, demand is mainly being met by imports, which are now well in excess of 20m tonnes per year. Regional consumption is estimated at around 29m tonnes in 2017/18, up by around 500,000 tonnes from 2016/17. Almost all wheat is consumed for food purposes, with less than 2% of total demand channeled into feed sectors. South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya are the five-largest consumers of wheat in the region, accounting for around 65% of overall consumption. Of these countries, Nigeria is by far the least self-sufficient, importing virtually all of its domestic needs, forecast to be around 4.7m tonnes in 2017/18. Wheat demand in Africa will eventually begin to slow in response to an anticipated moderation in population growth and the inclusion of more animal proteins in diet, but such changes are unlikely in the forecast period.

World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, driven by the Black Sea region, but China, India and parts of Latin America have also contributed bigger crops. The harvested area has increased across many parts of the globe, and average yields have also risen, despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat seed technology. The 2017/18 crop year has seen spells of occasionally poor weather in parts of the US, Canada and Australia, but yields were better than expected earlier on in the season. Disparities between pre-harvest expectations and final results are not easily explained, but may be linked to the latest seed technology and farming methods, which seemingly better mitigate against sub-optimal cropping weather. Incorporating a series of upgrades, including for Russia, where production and yields superseded all previous records, we have raised our global crop forecast for 2017/18 by 7m tonnes, to 758m tonnes, a new all-time high and the fifth successive annual rise. With prices at relatively low levels, there is unlikely to be much incentive for farmers to increase 2018/19 plantings. Crop rotation needs will again be important, but in countries where there are few alternatives, seeded area is unlikely to show much year-on-year change. Assuming average yields, the world crop is forecast to contract by 1.4% in 2018/19, to 747m tonnes.
After a small EU crop last year, output should rise in 2017/18
Despite a mixed year for the main EU wheat growers, the 2017/18 crop is expected to be slightly larger than average, at 152m tonnes. Yields have rebounded strongly in France-which accounts for around one-quarter of the bloc's total output-following the previous season's sub-par results. Survey results also confirm its good quality, with a much higher percentage than last year meeting milling specifications. In contrast, a wet finish to the German harvest has led to a series of quality downgrades in key northern export-producing areas. Spain's wheat crop was also negatively affected by a punishing drought, which lasted for virtually the entire year. Producers are now wrapping up 2018/19 winter wheat planting. Low prices, forecast to be below production costs in some countries, are expected to be a general disincentive. However, with earlier wet conditions preventing some producers from switching wheat area to rapeseed as intended, there is unlikely to be much overall change in plantings for next year's harvest. Assuming normal yields, output is likely to be in line with the average, at around 150m tonnes.
Russian production outperforms market expectations in 2017/18
Preliminary 2017/18 production data from Russia's statistical agency were higher than market expectations and above those released by the Ministry of Agriculture during the harvest campaign, with all wheat output officially pegged at 84.9m tonnes, 12m tonnes more than last season's huge crop and 50% more than the previous five-year average. Winter and spring wheat crops enjoyed near-perfect growing conditions, benefitting from timely and abundant rains. The massive crop has kept exporters extremely busy in recent months, pushing the country's infrastructure to the limit. With unusually warm weather allowing port operations to continue over the normally frigid winter months, shipments have continued at a record pace and are now on track to reach 35m tonnes in the period ending June 2018.
Sowing of the 2018/19 winter wheat crop was hindered by spells of unfavourable weather, including dryness in key southern regions, where up to 50% of the sowings were completed outside of the optimal planting window. Total winter grains area (mainly wheat) failed to meet the official estimate, dropping by around 1% year on year. Moreover, unseasonable warmth has kept protective snowcover to a minimum so far this winter with some plants still growing. These crops could be especially vulnerable to yield loss should freezing temperatures emerge in the coming weeks and months. With better productivity from the last harvest lifting the trend yield higher, we have raised our production forecast slightly from our previous report, to 74m tonnes, down by 13% year on year but still potentially 12% above average.
US wheat production fell sharply in 2017/18
US wheat production in 2017/18 is forecast at 47.4m tonnes, down by 25% year on year, and at a 15-year low. The sharp drop in output mainly reflects a drop in plantings, with the smallest harvested area in almost 130 years. Depressed prices and limited potential for profits mean that another fall in winter and spring plantings is likely in 2018/19. Because of limited precipitation across much of the southern plains during December, Hard Red Wheat (HRW) crop ratings worsened in December, with scouts in Kansas and Oklahoma reporting the worst year-end conditions in five years. Because of limited insulating snowcover, the onset of extreme cold temperatures affecting almost the whole country during the initial weeks of January 2018 is likely to have resulted in at least some winterkill damage. As is always the case, the extent of any damage will be impossible to gauge until crops emerge in the spring. For now, production projections are held unchanged, but with some downside risk. Assuming reduced abandonment and better overall yields, mainly for spring-sown wheat, 2018/19 production is forecast to rise by 4.9%, to 49.7m tonnes.
Harvest results in Canada were much better than originally expected
According to the final crop update from Statistics Canada, 2017/18 all wheat production totalled 30m tonnes, a 5% drop from the previous season but 2.8m tonnes more than the agency predicted in October. The total included 22.2m tonnes of spring wheat, up 8% year on year, with gains tied to a rise in both area and yields, which increased despite spells of very hot and dry weather in southern parts of the Prairies. The drop in overall output was instead attributed to a smaller winter crop and in particular, a decline in durum, production of which slumped by 36%, to just 5m tonnes. Looking ahead to the next year, farmers have reported a second successive drop in winter wheat plantings, seen at a 13-year low. However, with spring sown varieties accounting for around 90% of output, the 2018/19 outlook is still far from certain. Comparatively firm prices versus canola and reduced competition from pulses could see spring wheat area staying high, with production projected at around 30m tonnes, unchanged versus the previous year.
China's wheat support policies to realign with international prices
Latest official data from China confirmed a small rise in 2017/18 wheat production, as an improvement in yields more than compensated for a minor reduction in harvested area. After focusing first on efforts to realign cotton, maize, rapeseed and soybean markets with international prices, authorities are now beginning to tweak foodgrain price support policies too. Following changes to rice subsidy programmes last year, the government recently announced a 2.5% reduction in the 2018/19 minimum state purchase price for wheat, the first cut since its start. With winter wheat planting for next year's crop already mostly finished, the policy shift is unlikely to have much of an impact for 2018/19. Sowings are expected to stay relatively high, with production tentatively placed at 129m tonnes.
Early challenges for Indian wheat farmers due to poor air conditions
India's government recently raised the minimum support price (MSP) for the 2018/19 wheat crop by around 7%, a slightly sharper rise than in previous years. As part of wider efforts to support farmers and curb cheap imports (mainly from the Black Sea region), authorities confirmed that the wheat import duty would be doubled to 20%. Although both initiatives were expected to support planting decisions this season, sowings have consistently lagged behind the year-earlier rate and the recent trend. In early January sowings were down by 5% year on year. The delayed sowings is partly because of air pollution. With authorities cracking down harder on farmers flouting the ban on stubble burning, there were delays in removing crop residues from paddy fields earlier on in the season. Faced with few alternative means of disposal, however, many growers continued to burn rice straw, contributing to the air pollution. The smog and accompanying lack of sunlight has added to fieldwork delays in some states, where late planting adds to the risk of potentially lower yields. A shift in acreage from wheat to pulses is also being reported in Madhya Pradesh, the country's second-largest wheat producing state, where the state government is buying chickpeas at guaranteed minimum pricing this year. Climatic conditions have been broadly favourable so far, including normal temperatures and beneficial showers. Importantly, there has also been a notable absence of the yellow rust fungal disease. Based on a downgraded area estimate, we have trimmed our production forecast for 2018/19 by 1m tonnes, to 96.5m tonnes, potentially a larger than average crop.

A much smaller crop is expected in Australia for 2017/18
It has been a challenging year for Australia's wheat farmers, with production set to fall far short of the previous season's record-breaking results. Conditions have been especially poor in parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, where low rainfall and warmer than average temperatures prevailed during much of the spring and summer. In contrast, timely springtime rains revived prospects in Western Australia, resulting in successive upgrades to crop estimates in recent months. The harvest was much better than expected in that state, but protein content is said to be a little lower than normal due to reduced fertiliser use. Despite some occasional disruptions due to rains, harvesting across the country was almost finished by the first week of January, in line with schedule. With encouraging results from the key western growing areas, we have raised our production forecast by 1m tonnes to 21.5m tonnes. With supplies boosted by large carryover stocks, next year's exportable surplus is expected to be large, enough for shipments of at least 17.5m tonnes (22.5m tonnes last year). For the following year, a return to normal yields should sustain a larger crop, currently expected at 25m tonnes.
Stocks and prices
Cumulative world stocks are forecast to rise for the fifth consecutive season in 2017/18 to 257m tonnes, up by 7% year on year to an all-time high. However, this aggregate masks some important features, as gains in world inventories are mostly attributed to end-season stock rises in India and China, whose stocks are not available to the world market. Indeed, with China's stocks having doubled over a five-year period, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to use carryovers in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supplies. Cumulative stockpiles in those countries are forecast to drop by around 2% year on year, to 74.7m tonnes, but will still be up by 18% from the average in recent years. The projection for 2018/19 is provisional, but suggests a continuation of the most recent trend. World stocks are likely to remain high, perhaps even in excess of 2017/18 levels. Exporter stocks of 63.4m tonnes, although not considered tight, would be the smallest in five years.
Russia's wheat stocks have tripled in just three years
Although Russia's exports have been running at a record pace in recent months, infrastructure capacity constraints mean that July-June shipments could be limited to around 35m tonnes, nowhere near enough to prevent a further build-up in 2017/18 stocks. Works to upgrade existing terminals are ongoing, and although new port facilities are also being planned for construction, including in eastern parts of the country, close to China, these projects are expected to take three or more years to complete. Therefore, following two successive massive crops, wheat stocks are expected to reach a record high at the end of 2017/18, potentially reaching 18.5m tonnes, up from just 5.6m tonnes two seasons ago. High stock levels are expected to keep a lid on prices heading into the next season and, even if 2018/19 production falls short of recent levels, the additional supplies should provide a cushion, allowing Russia to maintain its dominant position on the world export market.

Ample Russian supplies will cap potential price rises
World wheat prices have risen since bottoming out at the end of November. Net gains of about 3% during the past six weeks have been tied mainly to advances in high quality milling wheat values, supplies of which remain in comparatively shorter supply. Stronger fob Gulf export premiums also reflected better overseas buying interest for some HRW wheat grades. Some strength in US futures was also evident in the first week of January, as speculative funds scrambled to cover a very large net short position amid widespread talk of possible winterkill damage across parts of the southern and eastern wheat belt. Amid overall heavy world availabilities and strong competition for available export business, wheat prices are expected to show only limited upside potential over the next few years, especially if Russian shipments stay high. However, with prices proving more resilient in recent months than previously expected, we have raised our price projections (HRW, 12% protein, fob Gulf) through to the first quarter of 2020 by around USUS$10/tonne. However, this remains well down from the lofty levels seen a few seasons ago. Higher protein supplies are expected to command a hefty price premium, at least until the 2018/19 northern hemisphere crops enter the pipeline.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power in the wake of the installation of a Constituent Assembly in 2017 and rigged presidential elections this coming April, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations or boosts dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract into 2019. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, GDP contraction and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making the country one of the least attractive investment locations in the world. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme (although this is winding down), the country is running short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$11bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages, narrowing the current-account deficit to 0.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Even as Venezuela's severe economic woes deepen amid an intensifying debt crisis and hyperinflation, the governing Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has strengthened its hold on power as the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has slid into disarray. The government, led by the president, Nicolás Maduro, has unilaterally set presidential elections for April 22nd. As in the past, the PSUV has used fraudulent administrative obstacles to ban the majority of opposition parties, including the MUD itself. We expect further chicanery to ensure that Mr Maduro will be re-elected. The Economist Intelligence Unit then expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition process, most likely ushering the MUD into power in 2019.
In August, following a fraudulent referendum amid widescale protests across the country, the MUD-controlled National Assembly was superseded by the PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC). The PSUV also holds almost all municipalities in the country and 20 of 24 governorships, following elections late last year that were neither free nor fair. The PSUV's tight control of the justice and electoral systems means that at present the MUD has no real chance of gaining power democratically. On top of this, the MUD's propensity for infighting has been compounded by the PSUV's own tactic of generating divergent interests by rewarding co-operation from some factions while penalising others. Furthermore, MUD's support base has become increasingly demoralised and demobilised. Although hard data is unavailable, the increasingly large Venezuelan diaspora may well be mostly composed of anti-PSUV sympathisers.
The PSUV's future currently depends on the support of three key backers: the state's coercive apparatus (the security forces and military); a sizeable sector of the population dependent on government handouts; and the so-called colectivos, activist groups that are a cross between community organisers and PSUV paramilitaries. The key backer is the military, which controls most of the ministries related to management of the economy and security. This includes-since November-the Ministry of Oil and PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The government plies these groups with resources, with the vast majority coming from PDVSA. We believe that a prolonged interruption in exports by PDVSA would destabilise this patronage system.
There are three main paths towards a destabilising interruption in PDVSA exports. The most immediate path is legal action in the US, as permitted in the contracts of external bonds on which PDVSA and the government have fallen into arrears. Concerted, widespread legal action resulting in seizures of PDVSA's assets (such as those of Citgo, a PDVSA-owned, US-based refinery) could curtail exports dramatically. Secondly, a similar interruption of exports would take place if the US imposes a ban on Venezuelan oil exports, a threat that the US government has often made. We believe that replacing US demand with other sources would be logistically impossible for the government in the short term.
Our third path relates to PDVSA's falling output. This works independently of the first two scenarios and, unlike them, means a permanent reduction of export earnings. Oil output has fallen by over 20% since Mr Maduro took office, and we expect production to continue dropping, dragging with it PDVSA's US dollar earnings. Politically motivated investment from Russia and China, once abundant, seems unlikely to return in enough volume to prop up production.
Although we expect further concessions to the military in 2018, declining oil output will put the government's patronage system at risk by late 2018 or early 2019. In the current context of political polarisation, our baseline scenario has the military pushing out the PSUV while paving the way for elections, leading to a democratically elected opposition government in office in 2019. However, there is a risk that free and fair elections would be significantly delayed, given that the military's democratic values have eroded following years of co-operation with the PSUV.
Regardless of how and when political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. In addition to having to contend with holdovers in the colectivos and in the military, the opposition will have to confront huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The government has decreed that a presidential election will take place on April 22nd. The regime has barred most opposition parties, including the MUD itself. Given the tight electoral schedule-candidacies must be decided by February 27th-the opposition may not come to an agreement on a unified candidate. The risk of a partial or complete boycott by the opposition has grown. Regardless, we expect the elections to go ahead and for Mr Maduro to be victorious in elections riddled with irregularities. We do expect relatively free and fair elections following the PSUV's exit from power.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Venezuela has come under increasing regional and international pressure. Mercosur (a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and the so-called Lima Group (a group of 12 Latin American nations) have denounced the regime. Internationally the EU and the US have applied sanctions. US sanctions remain the most relevant, as they have made it nearly impossible for PDVSA and the government to renegotiate their debts. In addition, the US has often (most recently in early February) threatened sanctions on the oil trade. As Venezuela gets the vast majority of its hard currency earnings from exports to the US (in addition to importing production inputs) the embargo would have a destabilising effect on the government's patronage system, and could potentially prove a trigger to regime change. So far, the US has been reticent to enact oil sanctions, perhaps mindful of the socio-economic costs to American workers and consumers.
A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia. The latter continues to provide limited financial backing, but it seems increasingly unlikely to provide the several billions of dollars needed each year not just to avoid default but also to stem the decline of oil output. China, a previous major source of financing, has seemingly with-drawn; there is no public evidence of any new Chinese financing since 2015.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government's immediate economic policy concern will be fending off debt default and associated legal challenges. The government has gone into arrears on some sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including PDVSA bonds), while also reportedly making late payments on others. The government has restated its commitment to pay while blaming payments delays on US sanctions and the payment system. Mr Maduro has called for a debt restructuring, but this appears impossible. This is owing to logistical challenges imposed by US sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks an economic programme that would be acceptable to creditors.
There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer late payment to lengthy legal battles. Eventually, this stance is likely to change. To avoid PDVSA asset seizures, the government may choose to openly default on sovereign bonds but adhere to PDVSA's repayment schedule. So far it has done neither. If it did openly default, sovereign creditors would undoubtedly ask US courts to define PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government in order to seize its assets. However, such claims will take time, meaning that the timing of likely seizures is unclear. When they do happen, the consequences on the economy will be devastating. We assume that they would trigger a transition of power and, eventually, a change of economic policy direction.
In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. In line with our expectations, the government undertook a maxi-devaluation in February 2018, but even at current rates the currency remains overvalued and foreign exchange remains rationed, with the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) claiming "difficulties" in settling trades. Economic policy will remain unstainable. Monetisation of large public deficits will continue and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find.
Under our baseline scenario we expect the opposition to come to power in 2019. An adjustment package, including a re-structuring of debt, would follow. We have factored in a financing agreement with the IMF to support the process, forecasting lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. We also expect significant financial and real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) accounts since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a NFPS deficit of 19.3% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2022. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Under our baseline forecast of severe economic stress that would see the opposition taking power in 2019, we expect a restructuring process with external creditors to happen.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the BCV will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits; money supply (M2) rose by 1,311% year on year in January. In the context of hyperinflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government will see real interest rates turn positive.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.6% in 2017. Our forecast for a recovery in 2021-22 rests on an assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme, including management of the country's oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Oil output will continue to shrink throughout 2018-19, reflecting a combination of severe mismanage-ment, underinvestment and depletion of oil fields. We expect output to bottom out at 1.35m barrels/day (b/d) in 2019, down from 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecasts, oil production will pick up in 2020, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Exports, however, will only recover in 2021, as domestic demand has been artificially constrained. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply. Dependence on oil will persist in 2018-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. The govern-ment continues to decree maximum prices and fines as its main policy tool to fight inflation, with closures of supermarket a common occurrence. We do not expect a policy reversal under the PSUV government, meaning that inflation will remain extremely high in the short term. Official data has not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 84% in January, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 4,000%. We now expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. Shortages of basic goods will continue, as the lack of foreign currency limits imports. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Despite the recent announcement of exchange-rate unification and maxi-devaluation, the currency remains overvalued and further currency adjustment will be necessary. Rationing of foreign currency will continue in the short term.
In late January the BCV announced that the Dicom exchange rate would be used by both the private and public sectors and in late February announced a massive devaluation to BsF24,898:US$1 (the previous Dicom rate was BsF3,445:US$1). The new Dicom system remains opaque and provides no guarantee that the government-which monopolises the country's export business-will provide foreign exchange, making the auction system unsustainable. Indeed, the BCV has already announced difficulties in settling trades at the new rate. This, coupled with runaway growth in the money supply, will continue to put pressure on the exchange rate. The black-market foreign-exchange rate was at around BsF230,000:US$1 in early February.
Given the existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. In our baseline scenario of a MUD-led government in 2019, similar measures may be undertaken. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Following higher-than-expected import compression in 2017, we have revised our current-account forecast for 2018, and we now expect a surplus of US$3.3bn (0.7% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms). Even though we assume that extreme compression of imports will continue (we estimate imports in 2017 were a fifth of those of 2012), Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state companies' bonded debt alone amount to US$4.2bn. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and that imports will begin a recovery. We foresee the current account to go into a deficit of 4.5% of GDP in 2020 at the no-longer highly distorted exchange rate. Recovering oil production and the re-structured interest payment schedule will see the current-account deficit narrow to 1.1% of GDP in 2022.
With the opposition in power, financial and investment inflows will provide sufficient financing and help to rebuild reserves coverage. This will buttress the stability of the external accounts and facilitate the gradual removal of foreign-exchange controls, narrowing the gap between official and parallel exchange rates. There are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. It hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process within 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states, as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just below 70% by 2022, from an estimated 79.8% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.5%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16 and 2.2% in 2017. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain stable in the forecast period, at 2.2% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score improves only marginally between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). As a result, the country drops one place in the regional ranking, to 11th, and two places in the global ranking, to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. No progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms and coalition, as well as party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and reformed the party around himself. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
The ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition in mid-December after just over a month and a half of negotiations. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved close to the FPÖ in many policy areas (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly accused Mr Kurz of copying the FPÖ's programme) and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
Although the chancellor is from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals, owing in part to internal party upheaval. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties. The risk of an early election is high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit in the new Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) until the end of its term in late 2022.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018 but give only a limited view of national political trends, as they are fought mostly on local issues. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which could exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The new government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the EU in the coming years, especially on reform of migration, and this should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. We expect the government to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, the reception has been more muted this time. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy in recent years has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal.
The new govern-ment plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum seekers and cutting child benefits sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexibility for working hours. However, it does not plan to reform the country's so-called Proporz system under which the ÖVP and SPÖ had apportioned public life-state companies, public services, subsidies, regulatory responsibilities-despite suggestions from both coalition parties in the past, especially from the FPÖ, that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and for the government to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 2% in 2013, and public debt rose to 83.7% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending. Strong growth contributed to an estimated narrowing of the deficit to 1.1% of GDP in 2017.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.8% in 2017 to just below 70% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The economic recovery in the euro zone strengthened in 2017 and became more broad based. We expect another healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2018, of 2.2%, after growth of 2.5% in 2017. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, but maintains a clearly dovish policy stance, with the reduction in the amount of monthly QE purchases in 2018 designed to extend its presence in the bond markets. The bank also plans to delay raising interest rates and will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities for a period well beyond the end of the QE programme. We expect the pace of monthly QE purchases to be reduced to zero in early 2019, but owing to subdued price pressure and persistent downside risks to growth, we expect the bank will keep policy rates unchanged throughout the first half of our forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and underperformed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economy recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.9% between July 2016 and September 2017. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector, and we expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.9% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.5%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019-22. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments, including any shocks to global trade.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy-price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to full-year average inflation of 2.2%. Recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect it to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. In the second half of the year a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar, leading to a year-end rate of US$1.20:EUR1. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect the trade balance to gradually move into balance in the coming years as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, the services balance will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly flat throughout 2018-22, at 2.2% of GDP on average.

Abstract: Since the failed coup in 2016 foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to Turkey, the Syrian Kurdish groups are affiliated with the PKK and are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey. The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue influencing the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Despite a narrow victory and allegations of vote fraud in the presidential reform referendum on April 16th 2017, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is moving ahead with his plan to install a presidential system of government after the elections due in 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will win the elections. The presidential system will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
Since the failed coup in 2016 foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. Despite tax increases in 2018, we expect annual deficits to widen moderately, to 2.3% of GDP on average in 2018-19. After the elections we forecast that the deficit will shrink gradually, to 1.6% of GDP in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
We expect real GDP growth to slow from an estimated 7% in 2017 to a still robust 4.1% per year on average in the forecast period (2018-22), reflecting higher taxes and the withdrawal of stimulus measures. Our growth forecast assumes that domestic political conditions will stabilise and foreign investor confidence in Turkey will hold up, maintaining foreign capital inflows.
After a fall in the nominal value of the Turkish lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. Constrained in its ability to raise interest rates, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to currency weakness and high inflation.
We expect the current-account deficit to narrow moderately, from an estimated 5.5% of GDP in 2017 to an annual average of 4.7% of GDP in 2018-22. This is still sufficiently large to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is severely constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 55th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: The customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, have been announced for 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious, but political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates continues. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Third Istanbul airport becomes operational. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely following the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade."

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Among the most important political events in the 2018-22 forecast period will be the three crucial votes in 2019: municipal elections, due to be held in March; and parliamentary and presidential elections, due in November. After these votes an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parliamentary system. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving the country into a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup has eased partially, but we expect social and political tensions to intensify during the period up to the elections in 2019, and possibly beyond. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, further polarised the country. It also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and his party were losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place until after the elections, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk of terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS), and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but Turkey remains vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the PKK and IS. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
We expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the municipal, presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled, and he has the support of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process. However, there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, and that victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election is far from assured, especially if Abdullah Gul, a former president and co-founder of the AKP, decides to run. The challenge of Mr Gul, combined with that of the charismatic Meral Aksener, who recently formed the Good Party (IP), a breakaway group from the MHP, and the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, could prevent Mr Erdogan from reaching the 50% threshold for victory in the first round. This would transform the second-round run-off between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes into a deeply polarising referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation. This would boost the AKP's seat share, even if we expect that in exchange for the MHP's support for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election there will be an electoral alliance between the AKP and MHP to ensure that the MHP retains its representation in parliament. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a considerable risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding their concerns that under Mr Erdogan the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of Syrian Kurdish groups, which Turkey regards as terrorist organisations affiliated to the PKK; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of Turkey's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably to become president with executive powers after the elections in 2019.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over alleged violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces, or it withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out completely. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey´s crossborder military operation in north-western Syria against US-backed Kurdish groups that was launched on January 20th 2018, will accentuate existing tensions. According to Turkey, the Syrian Kurdish groups are affiliated with the PKK and are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
The spillover of violence from the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq will continue to pose serious domestic and external security threats to Turkey. In addition to terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey by IS, the country will face growing threats from the PKK, which has camps in the mountains in northern Iraq, not least as potential retaliation for Turkey's operations in north-western Syria.
The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue influencing the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. Under political pressure not to raise interest rates further, especially ahead of the 2019 elections, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. In the event of another severe weakening of the lira, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary. However, this is not our baseline scenario.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between moderate fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy, at the same time as encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and to prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to have expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 1.5% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, we expect increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects and public employment ahead of the elections next year to cause the deficit to widen further, to an average of 2.3% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing to 1.6% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to remain stable at about 28.5% in 2017-19, before declining gradually to 27.4% in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). However, because of political pressure not to raise interest rates further, we expect the central bank to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to the challenge, which will periodically test investor confidence in the bank's policy mix of moderate rate increases and macroprudential measures. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, but since November 2017 it has focused on using its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate to fund the banking system. This rate was gradually raised by a total of 275 basis points in 2017, to 12.75% in mid-December, pushing the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system to 12.75%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
We estimate that real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7% in 2017. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of 4.1% in 2018-22, reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, the withdrawal of government stimulus measures introduced to support the economy after the coup attempt in July 2016 and a gradual tightening of global liquidity. There are downside risks to our forecast, which is predicated on the assumption of a smooth transition to a presidential system of government without further political instability that could deter foreign capital inflows.
We forecast that household consumption growth will moderate from an estimated 5.5% in 2017 to a still solid 3.4% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and the withdrawal of government incentives to support household spending. We also expect government consumption growth to be strong, at an annual average rate of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing after the elections to a more moderate but still robust 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure, generating real growth of 5.5% per year in 2017-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, especially in the tourism sector; the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness; and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect growth to slow from an estimated 12% in 2017 to an annual average rate of 4.7% in 2018-22, reflecting base effects and our view that 2017 probably represented the recent peak in global economic growth. We continue to expect a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 to dampen external demand growth in that year.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
After a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow during the forecast period, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. There are substantial risks to this forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region. We expect the lira to average TL4.34:US1 in 2022, compared with TL3.66:US$1 in 2017.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Although we expect the current-account deficit to narrow moderately from an estimated 5.5% of GDP in 2017 to an annual average of 4.7% of GDP in 2018-22, Turkey's external financing needs will still be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. The rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Abstract: [...]even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels, on the back of ample global supply.[...]this will largely be offset by a drop in palm oil prices, as global production surges but changing consumer habits-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products-will result in lower demand growth.Recent weakness in global oil prices will also play a role as cheaper energy products incentivise farmers to divert more cane to sugar (rather than to its rival, ethanol), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth through--out the forecast period.2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Cocoa (US cents/lb) 110.6 138.9 142.2 131.1 92.4 89.6 88.7 89.0 92.0 94.0 Coffee (Arabica) (US cents/lb) 139.5 200.7 159.9 163.8 151.6 152.0 165.8 176.0 173.0 175.0 Coffee (Robusta) (US cents/lb) 94.2 100.5 88.0 88.6 101.8 100.5 103.5 98.0 100.0 103.5 Tea (US$/kg) 2.86 2.72 2.71 2.64 3.11 3.00 2.81 2.82 2.85 2.92 Sugar (US cents/lb) 17.7 17.0 13.4 18.1 16.1 16.1 16.3 17.0 17.3 17.6 Barley (US$/tonne) 206.4 146.1 127.9 129.4 137.2 135.9 139.2 135.6 140.9 146.1 Maize (US$/tonne) 264.4 206.0 175.5 168.3 161.5 162.5 172.5 175.0 182.0 187.0 Rice (US$/tonne) 489.5 423.8 386.0 386.0 388.3 415.0 420.0 409.0 417.0 427.0 Sorghum (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 858.1 849.9 870.4 847.8 880.6 913.4 Wheat (US$/tonne) 321.5 302.7 232.5 197.5 209.5 207.5 212.5 207.0 215.0 223.0 Soybeans (US$/tonne) 556.5 501.3 379.8 389.8 377.8 381.3 392.5 401.0 409.0 419.0 Soybean oil (US$/tonne) 1,056.7 909.3 756.9 808.9 842.9 864.7 890.2 908.9 927.6 927.6 Soymeal (US$/tonne) 545.3 527.9 394.8 379.8 355.3 351.3 352.5 369.3 376.9 376.9 Palm oil (US$/tonne) 856.9 821.4 622.7 700.2 721.4 684.8 614.8 585.0 600.0 608.0 Rapeseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,079.3 907.3 775.3 823.5 874.5 934.5 946.8 989.0 990.0 1,002.0 Sunflowerseed oil (US$/tonne) 1,124.0 901.8 845.8 841.0 801.8 846.3 914.5 875.0 860.0 866.0 Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Note. WCF (World commodity forecasts) is an index of 22 hard and soft commodities. FFB (Food, feedstuffs and beverages) is a price index of 13 soft commodities. The beverages sector has a weight of 20% in the FFB index, grains 46.4%, oilseeds 28.6% and sugar 4.9%. The FFB index has a weight of 55.6% in the WCF index.
Agricultural prices will remain weak in early 2018, sinking the annual average
The Economist Intelligence Unit's food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index is set to fall in year-on-year terms in 2018-the seventh consecutive year of decline-by 0.4%. This is a smaller margin than the estimated drop in prices in 2017, of 0.9%, as the markets for some agricultural goods, including oilseeds and grains such as wheat, maize and rice are beginning to tighten slightly. Nonetheless, most agricultural markets remain comfortably supplied, following several years of bumper harvests. Several crops registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. Although there is a risk that a La Niña weather event will have a negative effect on crop yields in some regions in the 2017/18 season, therefore pushing up prices, the impact is likely to be mixed; therefore, we have not included an agricultural price shock in our forecast. We expect the FFB index to begin to firm from late 2018 and to rise by an average of 2.3% in 2019, as some markets tighten further, causing prices for goods such as coffee, cocoa and wheat, to recover from rock bottom. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) of FFB goods in the medium and long term.
The recovery in agricultural prices in 2019 will be fairly modest
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw upon. We expect global GDP growth to remain fairly robust, at an average of 2.8% per year in 2018-19, down only slightly from estimated growth of 2.9% in 2017. However, the looming economic slowdown in China and uncertainty about global monetary policy continue to pose downside risks to demand. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. We expect the US dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19, and this will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further inflating global supplies. As a result, even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels, on the back of ample global supply.
Grain prices will post small rises, failing to recover to 2015 levels in 2018-19
We expect grain prices to contract by an average of 0.4% in 2018, as comfortable supplies weigh on wheat and maize prices. Nonetheless, the price declines in 2018 will be modest relative to those of 2014-16, when supply surged and global stocks accumulated. For wheat in particular, international prices appear to have found a floor after two years of sharp decline. Average world wheat prices surged in mid-2017, as drought in the northern US Plains region and dryness in parts of the EU, Australia and the Black Sea region raised concerns over tighter global supply. However, the damage to crops was less serious than initially expected, and we forecast prices to ease gradually throughout 2018 as the rapid growth in 2017 proves difficult to replicate, before rising again in 2019. Maize prices will remain fairly weak into the first half of 2018, undermined by the bumper 2016/17 crop, before inching up steadily over the course of 2018-19 as global consumption rises-particularly for animal feed-and the market tightens.
Oilseed prices will rise in 2018-19 as oversupplied markets begin to tighten
Oilseed prices fell by an estimated 1.5% in 2017, owing largely to the bumper soybean crop in major producers, such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stocks higher. However, we expect the price of soybeans, as well as sunflowerseed oil and rapeseed oil, to see fairly strong growth in 2018-19 as market supply begins to tighten and global demand continues to expand. However, this will largely be offset by a drop in palm oil prices, as global production surges but changing consumer habits-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products-will result in lower demand growth.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We forecast the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee and cocoa, to fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We forecast cocoa prices to decline at a fairly modest rate of 2% per year in 2018-19; however, this follows a massive drop in 2017, of nearly 30%, which was caused by soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices are set to remain fairly flat in 2018, as the relatively strong US dollar encourages exporters to sell their stocks, bringing new supplies onto the market. In 2019, however, we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to grow more quickly, by 9%, as several consecutive years of market deficits finally begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2018-19, but by a marginal amount
Sugar prices declined by an estimated 11% in 2017 as the market corrected after a price spike in late 2016 related to fears that supply from Thailand would be heavily affected by poor weather conditions. We expect global consumption to expand by a modest 0.7% per year on average in 2018-19 (1.3% previously) as high domestic prices limit demand in India, the second-largest global consumer. Recent weakness in global oil prices will also play a role as cheaper energy products incentivise farmers to divert more cane to sugar (rather than to its rival, ethanol), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth through--out the forecast period.

Cocoa
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that, after having contracted for two consecutive crop years, cocoa consumption grew by a marginal 0.4% in the 2016/17 season (October-September). Although cocoa demand is expected to accelerate slightly during the forecast period, by an average of 1.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19, it remains fairly weak by historical comparison. Recent cocoa grind data point to a somewhat stronger third quarter of 2017 in Europe, in line with our current projections for a gradual pick-up in demand, but none of the main developed markets will be in a position to fuel rapid growth in cocoa consumption, reflecting high existing cocoa consumption levels per head. In contrast to some other soft commodity markets, where producing countries are starting to become major consumers, cocoa consumption levels among producers are (and will remain) extremely low, hampering the scope for firmer global growth in cocoa consumption. Meanwhile, recent falls in cocoa prices will be slow to feed through to retail prices, which will continue to push some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. The average size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity, but also to protect profits during a time of high cocoa prices-also hampering cocoa consumption growth in the forecast period.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in much of the OECD-even factoring in a gradual slowdown in China in 2018. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounts for 26% of the world's imports of cocoa powder, compared with just 13% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to boost demand for powder.
Higher prices will slow consumption growth in developed markets
Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for nearly 20% of global demand) and Europe (which collectively accounts for 40% of global demand) are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate (with a higher cocoa content), but with less frequent purchases. Recent sales figures from the main chocolate manufacturers indicate that, on balance, this is pushing down overall consumption. This is illustrated by data from 2015/16, which show that cocoa demand contracted in several large markets (including the US and Canada) and grew only marginally in others (including in Europe), despite fairly strong underlying economic conditions in many of these areas.
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2017/18-2018/19. Health concerns, market saturation and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping will erode spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases). However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption.
Russian and Brazilian cocoa consumption will begin to recover
Lower cocoa consumption in 2015/16 in Brazil and Russia, which together account for nearly 10% of global demand, demonstrate the extent to which cocoa demand is affected by underlying economic conditions, particularly in developing economies, where chocolate is not regarded as a basic good. We estimate that both of these countries saw consumption contract further in 2016/17-reflecting the high cost of cocoa in local-currency terms. For Russia, restrictions on a number of imports from the EU that have been in place since mid-2014 are having an adverse effect on demand for many consumer goods. We expect cocoa demand in Russia to continue to stage a gradual recovery in 2017/18 and 2018/19, growing by an average 1.4% per year, as the country emerges from two years of economic recession. The same is true of Brazil, where we forecast cocoa consumption to return to growth in 2017/18-2018/19, averaging 1.5% per year, assuming that the economy continues to recover slowly.
Cocoa consumption growth will slow in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels (at just 37 g in India and 59 g in China in 2015/16, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets). However, demand will be hampered by high retail prices and, in China, consumer caution, particularly in 2018-19. Although Chinese demand will continue to rise, we expect the pace of growth to slow from 5% in 2017/18 to 3.5% in 2018/19. In India, we expect demand growth to accelerate from 3.4% in 2017/18 to 4.2% in 2018/19, owing to firmer underlying economic conditions.

Supply
Global cocoa production surged by an estimated 15% in 2016/17 on the back of improved weather conditions, after a particularly difficult El Niño event and a severe harmattan season (a dry winter wind blowing from the Sahara) cut cocoa output in many of Africa's main producers in 2015/16. We expect global cocoa production to fall during 2017/18 and 2018/19, by 6.6% and 1.2% respectively, mainly reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire-the world's largest cocoa producer. Its output will remain high by historical comparison, but another bumper crop is unlikely, reflecting lower farm gate prices and weaker confidence among growers. Overall, recent price weakness is likely to dissuade farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticide, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production. The rising possibility of a La Niña weather phenomenon poses some uncertainties, but risks to our forecasts are less pronounced than for some of the other agricultural commodities. Although El Niño episodes do tend to disrupt production, La Niña tends to have a more muted effect, with drier than normal weather in cocoa-producing regions in South America and Asia often being offset by better growing conditions in West Africa.
Structural and geographic factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farm gate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa but farmers also receive a much smaller share of the final retail price than in the previous decades, owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. Many farmers in West Africa remain below the poverty line, and as a consequence few young people in the region are choosing to work in the cocoa sector. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to encourage people to work in the cocoa sector, but it is uncertain how effective these methods will be in the long term.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can be grown only in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) under warm and humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Nonetheless, there are countries that have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of manufacturing facilities to grind beans in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production has soared in 2016/17
In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa production jumped by nearly 30% in 2016/17, to a record of just over 2m tonnes. However, this upward trend is not expected to continue, and we forecast that cocoa production will fall by 11.2% in 2017/18 and 2.2% in 2018/19. The authorities are unlikely to be able to replicate the exceptionally high level of output registered in 2016/17, with the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC), issuing fewer export licences and projecting production in 2017/18 in the range of 1.725m-1.75m tonnes. Although our production forecast is fairly strong by historical comparison, we expect output to fall steadily in the forecast period. Policy will not be particularly supportive: following a sharp cut to farm gate prices ahead of the mid-crop in March 2017, the CCC has kept prices on hold for the 2017/18 harvest, with price levels around one-third lower than a year ago. This has discouraged use of fertiliser and pesticide, with crop disease rising as a result. The government had hoped to raise farm gate prices, but any increase in the producer price would mean cutting export duties and therefore forgoing fiscal revenue, which is unlikely. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from global price volatility, but these funds have seemingly been insufficient to shield farmers' incomes and-given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC-neither farmers nor exporters have confidence that losses arising from low global prices will be recouped.
Ghanaian government will struggle to boost cocoa production significantly
Similar production trends will be evident in Ghana. Cocoa production rebounded firmly in 2016/17, with favourable weather and a mild harmattan season lifting cocoa production to an estimated 925,000 tonnes (well above the official target of 800,000 tonnes). However, we do not expect further significant and sustained growth in production during 2017/18-2018/19. For now, Ghana's cocoa board (Cocobod) has been more reluctant than the Ivorian authorities to cut prices paid to farmers, but Cocobod has been forced to seek a bridging loan from the central bank, indicating that farm gate prices may need to be cut, particularly if global cocoa prices fail to recover. Combined with anxiety among farmers about the government's intentions to evolve agriculture towards other crops, ongoing encroachment by gold miners and the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser, production is forecast to fall by 10.3% in 2017/18, before staging a partial (but weak) recovery in 2018/19, of just 3.6%.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally three to five years). The authorities ultimately aim to raise production to 1.5m tonnes within four years, also driven by better soil management, and better pest and disease control. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (Cocobod estimates 40%) and a consequent low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). Replanting, in particular, will help to address the problem of swollen shoot disease, which affects nearly one-fifth of cocoa trees and is associated with low yields. However, we think it unlikely that these ambitious plans will reach fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
After falling for the second consecutive crop year in 2016/17, cocoa production in Cameroon will remain weak during 2017/18-2018/19. Cuts in farm gate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". The fact that plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year have failed to materialise, with the area under cocoa cultivation rising by only around 3,000 ha since 2014, will severely hamper the expansion of the cocoa sector.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has slumped in recent years, and the country has slipped from being the world's fourth-largest producer to the sixth-largest (on a par with Brazil). Government initiatives designed to support farmers have not proved successful, with efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and increase the distribution of free seedlings floundering. With the country's mining and energy sector suffering from moderate inter-national oil prices, there is official acknowledgement that investment in raising cocoa production could generate greater foreign-exchange earnings, and the Ministry of Agriculture has recently outlined its ambitious goal of boosting cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. Its short-term goal is to lift cocoa production to 300,000-320,000 tonnes in 2017/18, with the medium-term target of raising output to 1m tonnes/year. However, problems with weak infrastructure, corruption, poor (and expensive) access to financing and weak implementation capacity will hamper these efforts.
Prospects are weak for Indonesia's cocoa sector
The authorities in Indonesia have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these are highly unlikely to materialise. Adverse weather hampered both the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 harvest, with cocoa output registering its third consecutive annual decline in the latter season. On the assumption of more stable weather conditions, output should resume growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19, but at an expected 320,000 tonnes at the end of the forecast period, cocoa output will remain weak by historical comparison. Indonesian firms are likely to rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from neighbouring Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America will not be realised in 2018-19
Agriculture in Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, was affected by El Niño in 2015/16. However, with better weather conditions, output is estimated to have recovered firmly in both countries in 2016/17. Structurally, there is scope for both countries to lift cocoa output as manufacturers look to boost investment in the region in an attempt to diversify production away from West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. However, some of this investment will be slow to materialise, as global prices remain depressed amid excess supply, which will act as a brake on growth potential.

Stocks and prices
We expect the global cocoa market to remain in surplus during the forecast period, and for the surplus to narrow gradually, from an estimated 536,000 tonnes in 2016/17 to 98,000 tonnes by 2018/19. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that cocoa production will remain higher than consumption by some margin. Tepid demand growth makes a return to a market deficit unlikely during the forecast period. Stocks are forecast to exceed 2.2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is very high by historical comparison. Moreover, there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output.

After remaining high for much of 2014-16, at around US$3,000/tonne, cocoa prices plummeted between December 2016 and late April 2017, to less than US$1,900/tonne. Although prices have recovered somewhat, they averaged less than US$2,000/tonne each month from May-September, only increasing to around US$2,100/tonne in October on the back of weaker production prospects in Côte d'Ivoire. Although global production prospects will remain weak in the near term, we see little likelihood of a sustained recovery in average prices, owing to the global supply glut. We forecast prices to fall by 3% in 2018, to an average of US$1,975/tonne, and by a further 1% in 2019, to US$1,955/tonne.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption expanded by around 2.7% in both 2015/16 and 2016/17, largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries (mainly developed economies) that account for two-thirds of global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the pace of consumption growth to accelerate to 3.1% in 2017/18, aided by stronger underlying economic conditions in many of the large consuming markets, before slipping to 2% in 2018/19. Notwithstanding ongoing monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers, overall domestic demand is expected to remain firm, supporting coffee consumption. In coffee-producing countries (many of which are emerging markets), consumption growth will continue to average 2.4% per year, held back somewhat by tepid demand growth in Brazil (which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption, owing to the sheer size of its domestic market). Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China. Although we expect China's GDP growth rate to slow from 2018, the deceleration will be concentrated in the investment and industrial sectors, and we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, meaning that there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth. However, coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic coffee demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global consumption growth.
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America and Europe, but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets. In some markets-including the US and China-the large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although comprising a small market share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that, in volume terms, the instant and ground coffee market remains larger. Although sales of machines and capsules are slowing sharply after initial firm growth, the coffee pod market will continue to provide important support for overall demand of arabica coffee (most pods contain predominantly arabica beans).
Coffee consumption growth in North America will increase steadily
US coffee consumption growth is forecast to average 1.6% a year in 2017/18-2018/19. Data from the US National Coffee Association show that the percentage of people drinking coffee is rising rapidly (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017). Daily consumption is rising and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products (US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over the past two years). There are indications that long-term consumption growth may continue to rise, with the number of coffee shops increasing at around 3.6% per year and the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee rising from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017, and demand growth among 18-24-year-olds also rising strongly.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers show a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations than other age brackets. We expect coffee consumption growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to pick up slightly, to an average of 2.7%, in 2017/18-2018/19.
Coffee consumption in Brazil is expected to falter
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. However, a sharp economic recession has hampered coffee consumption growth, which has flatlined in recent years, following firm growth in 2005-15. We expect coffee consumption growth to recover to an average pace of 1.3% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. Although underlying economic growth is expected to pick up, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment, rising fuel prices and higher inflation, which will all drag on disposable income.
Fairly firm coffee consumption growth is expected in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia (and the fourth-largest in the world), with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by 3.1% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption growth to rise by an average of 2.3% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. The slower pace of growth will reflect somewhat less supportive underlying economic conditions, after a stellar pace of economic growth in 2017. Nonetheless, annual growth in coffee con-sumption of 2.3% is fairly firm, given the size of the market, and will be under-pinned by coffee sales in convenience stores, as the number of coffee shops is falling. In South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with coffee imports more than trebling between 2006 and 2016 and the number of coffee shops increasing even more rapidly. Although we forecast somewhat weaker growth in coffee consumption in 2017/18-2018/19, the pace of growth will remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 3.1%.
Coffee consumption in China and India-currently both small consumers-will continue to grow. Much of the growth in Chinese coffee consumption will be in the out-of-home sector, reflecting the rising popularity of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres. A significant share of the new stores opened by Starbucks in 2016-17 are in Asia. The company now runs 3,000 outlets in 135 Chinese cities (nearly 600 in Shanghai alone, Starbucks' largest presence in a single city), up from 2,300 last October, and is planning to have 5,000 stores open by 2021. We expect an economic slowdown in China in 2018, but the deceleration will be gradual and will largely be concentrated in the construction and industrial sectors. Given that we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth during 2017/18-2018/19.
Following a recent rapid expansion of the out-of-home sector in India, driven by comparatively low consumer price inflation, rising disposable income and favourable demographics (around one-half of the population is aged under 25), coffee consumption remained flat in 2016/17. We expect a return to growth in 2017/18-2018/19, with coffee consumption rising by an average of 3.3% per year. South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in some countries (mainly coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam), and rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia, and recently opened its first store in Vietnam.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee (which generally use the robusta variety) in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.

Supply
Final data from the 2016/17 crop year (October-September) were much more positive than earlier market expecations, with coffee production rising by 3.4%, reflecting firm growth in output in Brazil-the world's largest producer. Coffee production is forecast to fall by 0.7% in 2017/18 as production in Brazil declines as the biennial crop alternates between higher- and lower-producing years (2017/18 is an "off-season" crop year). This will be only partly offset by firmer output growth in most other producing countries. However, there is a risk that global coffee production could decline more rapidly than currently forecast, depending on whether a La Niña weather phenomenon develops in the coming months. This brings a fall in Pacific Ocean water temperatures, typically disrupting coffee output by bringing heavy rains to many of Asia's coffee producers and drought to the main Latin American growers. Global coffee production growth is expected to be much stronger in 2018/19, at 3.9%, as Brazil's crop shifts to an "on-season" year.
We envisage a growing concentration of coffee production among the world's largest producers. Currently, a large number of countries (around 70) produce coffee, but the smaller producers have been struggling as a result of low world prices and rising overheads. In many of these countries, where coffee is not a particularly important area of the economy, farmers wield less power and are less likely to secure government support than in leading producers. Partly as a result, we expect coffee output in "other" countries to decline from 8.9m 60-kg bags in 2015/16 to 7.8m bags in 2018/19. Output in these countries-which fall outside the world's top 17 producers-will account for 5% of global production in 2018/19, down from nearly 15% in 2008/09.
Annual coffee production in Brazil is expected to remain well over 50m bags
In Brazil, by far the world's largest producer, final data from the on-season 2016/17 crop were more positive than expected, with coffee output rising by over 9%. This could reflect the weak local currency, which incentivised local growers, as international coffee prices are denominated in US dollars. Prospects for the off-season 2017/18 crop year are fairly strong and we are forecasting output of 52m bags. This is higher than projections from Conab (the government's crop supply agency), but official forecasts usually prove conservative. Our forecast remains similar to local private-sector expectations, and that of the US Department of Agriculture. Although adverse weather in mid-2016-including drought in some areas and irregular rainfall in others-raised concerns that beans might be damaged ahead of the harvest, recent weather has been more supportive, and the quality and quantity of beans have been good. Moreover, the still-weak local currency is continuing to provide an incentive to growers. Problems at some ports have hampered export capacity, but we do not expect this to have a significant impact on overall supply.
The 2018/19 crop year remains some way off, with coffee bushes only just beginning to flower, so output projections remain highly speculative. Local commentators have stated that they believe that there is potential for a bumper crop in 2018/19, with some even suggesting that output of up to 60m bags is possible, which would represent a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). At the moment, we forecast coffee production to rise to 55.5m bags. Although weather conditions have been supportive in most places, some coffee-producing states have seen below-average rainfall, which is likely to hamper faster production growth.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to recover from a severe drought
In Vietnam, the worst drought in three decades hampered production in 2016/17, with coffee output dropping by 11.3%. Assuming that weather conditions stabilise for the 2017/18 crop, there is scope for a rebound in Vietnam's coffee output; we forecast production of 27m bags, implying growth of 5.9%, followed by 3% growth (to 27.8m bags) in 2018/19. The authorities remain pessimistic about the medium-term prospects for production, forecasting coffee output to stabilise or decline slightly. However, government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop, will support firmer output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically high. Market jitters about widespread damage to coffee bushes from severe storms in coffee-growing areas in early November were quickly allayed and it appears that this bout of weather had minimal impact on coffee beans. In addition, firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will encourage growers.
Output from Mexico and Central America will slip in 2017/18
Coffee production rebounded strongly in Mexico and Central America in 2016/17-rising by 17.5% year on year to 19.4m bags. This followed a severe outbreak of coffee rust, followed by an El Niño weather phenomenon, which damaged plantations in the three previous seasons. However, the sharp jump in 2016/17 mainly reflected a rebound in output in Honduras and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. Nonetheless, there are reports that coffee rust is returning to some areas in the region, which could threaten output in 2017/18. Purchases of fungicides and fertiliser will help to prop up yields, but we nevertheless forecast a fall in coffee production of 5.3% in 2017/18. Assuming that coffee rust does not spread significantly and that weather conditions stay favourable, we expect coffee output to grow by 1.6% in 2018/19.
Colombian production is set to continue to rise in the medium term
Coffee production in Colombia has risen steadily in recent years, reaching a 24-year high of 14.5m bags in 2016/17. Prospects for 2017/18 are uncertain. The structural underpinnings of the sector are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes. In addition, efforts are being made to increase productivity, with recent additional planting in existing plantations aiming to raise average production per hectare, which at 18 bags per hectare in 2016 was much lower than in other large growers (27 bags per hectare in Brazil and 35 bags per hectare in Vietnam). However, recent cloudy weather conditions are affecting flowering on coffee bushes; if this continues, the crop yield will be hampered. For the time being, we project coffee production growth of 4.1% in 2017/18, but will monitor this closely in the coming months. In 2018/19 production should start to benefit from a 2016 peace agreement between the government and the left-wing FARC rebels, as coffee cultivation will increase in previously isolated areas of the country (the government has speculated that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as a result). We forecast coffee production growth of 4.6% in 2018/19, to 15.8m bags.
In Indonesia coffee production is recovering, but remains weak overall
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector-which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil-have been completely derailed. El Niño brought excessive dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the 2016/17 harvest, when output fell by 6.7%. However, exports have recently begun to recover owing to more supportive weather conditions, providing momentum heading into the 2017/18 season, when we expect production to rise by 4.4%. We expect production to grow by a further 2.5% in 2018/19, but at just 12.3m bags, output will remain low by historical comparison.
Production prospects in Africa, which accounts for around 11% of total global coffee output, are relatively bright. Many of the continent's coffee producers have very low levels of output; together, Ethiopia and Uganda account for 70% of African coffee output. Production rose solidly in both countries in 2016/17, mainly on the back of better weather conditions. We expect coffee production to continue to rise over the forecast period, but for the increase to be sharper in Uganda, reflecting an extensive re-seeding programme in recent years and an expansion of the coffee-growing area. Progress in these areas has been more gradual in Ethiopia, where we expect production growth to be more modest.

Stocks and prices
After stabilising in 2016/17, we expect global coffee stocks to fall in 2017/18-2018/19, reflecting a persistent market deficit. Even assuming some continued sales of stocks, as producers take advantage of the relatively weak local currencies against the US dollar, the market deficit is forecast to remain large throughout the forecast period. By end-2018/19 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 24.2m bags, from 31.6m bags in September 2016, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

After slumping again in 2017, arabica prices are set to rise in 2018
Arabica prices have fallen steadily during 2017, from an average of US$1.69/lb in January to US$1.41/lb in November. Given that the global market is set to register its third consecutive annual deficit in 2016/17, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often due to a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In recent months speculation about bumper production in Brazil has pushed prices lower. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock in order to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
We believe that speculation about the 2018/19 harvest in Brazil will continue to suppress prices; we forecast arabica prices to remain flat year on year, at an average of US$1.52/lb in 2018. This is in line with recent developments in futures markets, with coffee for March 2018 delivery trading at below US$1.3/lb. If production is disrupted on the back of an El Niño weather phenomenon, there is potential for prices to rebound sharply, given that prices remain low by historical comparison (and have arguably been over-sold given underlying market fundamentals). Given the likelihood that the next "off-season" in Brazil (2019/20) will hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery of prices, to an average of US$1.66/lb.
Tighter supplies of robusta beans and firm Asian demand will support prices
Prices for cheaper robusta held up better during much of 2017, reflecting concerns about the supply of robusta beans in the context of disappointing weather conditions in Vietnam and Indonesia, but dipped sharply in November as bean supply picked up. We expect prices to average US$1.01/lb in 2018 and US$1.04/lb in 2019, supported by rising Asian demand.

Maize
Demand
Maize is the most consumed (and produced) grain in the world, with total annual demand now in excess of 1bn tonnes/year (t/y). It is a versatile grain, with around 60% of the total used for animal feed, almost 30% for industrial processing (mainly fuel ethanol and starch) and the rest consumed directly as food or seed, or lost through waste. After a period of spectacular growth, demand for maize-based biofuels is now increasing more slowly, even though overall levels of consumption are still setting new records each year. However, following reports about China's plans for a massive expansion of its own fuel ethanol sector, world use for biofuels could potentially rise sharply from current levels over the medium term. Furthermore, maize is the primary energy source in compound feed mixes, and with ample supplies predicted across the world, it is well placed to meet predicted gains in demand in meat-exporting countries, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where consumption of animal protein continues to expand. Maize is by far the dominant feed grain in much of the world, with annual consumption typically more than four times that of wheat. In 2017/18 The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global demand to rise by 2.4% year on year, with stronger uptake expected across the animal feed, industrial and food sectors. A similar trend is projected for 2018/19, with overall consumption rising by 1.6%, to 1.05bn tonnes.
World feed demand will rise by 2% in 2017/18
World demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient in animal feed, which can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. Overall use, however, depends on availabilities and price relationships with other grains-mainly wheat-as well as high-protein oilmeals. A multitude of other factors can also have a direct impact on feed demand in any particular year, with producers having to consider pasture conditions and availability, as well as desired livestock weight, the economics of the meat industry and feed efficiency ratios. In 2017/18 we expect global growth in use of maize for livestock feed to slow to around 2%, down from almost 7% in the previous season. Further growth in maize feed demand is likely in 2018/19, with total feed use forecast to reach a record 595m tonnes.
Trade continues to increase year after year
Global maize trade in 2017/18 (July-June) is forecast to grow by 6.5% year on year, to reach a new record. Amid large surpluses across all of the major exporters, global prices are soft, and maize remains very competitively priced for inclusion in feed rations. A number of large buyers are expected to increase imports, with particularly strong growth likely in Mexico, the EU and Taiwan. This will easily compensate for a reduction in purchases by Brazil and South Africa, two countries that secured unusually large amounts in 2016/17 owing to severe weather difficulties. The EU is expected to displace Japan as the world's leading importer this year, with shipments pegged at a record 17m tonnes, up by more than a quarter compared with 2016/17. Mexico's imports are projected to rise by 1.5m tonnes, to 15.5m tonnes, also a new all-time peak, relegating Japan to third place on the league table of the world's biggest buyers.
China announces plans to boost ethanol production
Years of supply and demand imbalances in China have led to a massive surplus, with stocks soaring to an unprecedented level in recent years. Over-production was mainly linked to a now discontinued official stockpiling scheme, under which farmers in the largest maize provinces were able to sell unlimited amounts into state reserves at guaranteed minimum prices. At the same time, cheaper feed grain imports flooded into southern consuming regions, choking off demand for locally produced maize. Authorities are now working hard to unwind part of these burdensome stocks. Under a plan jointly announced by 15 ministries and commissions in September, the government is seeking a massive expansion of the biofuel sector, targeting the blending of 10% ethanol (E10) into all automotive petrol by 2020. The move is seen as a part of broader efforts to reduce China's carbon footprint. If E10 plans are fully implemented, an additional 35-40m tonnes of maize would be required as a feedstock each year.
China's maize stocks are likely to be larger than previously thought
Calls for such a steep and sustained increase in China's maize consumption suggest that local inventories could be much larger than we had previously expected. Our supply and demand estimates for the past decade have therefore recently been revised, with forecasts for feed use across this period lowered by an average of 18m t/y, equivalent to around 10% of total annual consumption. Given the sheer size of its grain economy, any revisions for China can appear to have an outsized impact. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the underlying trend is unchanged from before, and with so much of China's grain economy operating separately from the global market, these revisions do not have any wider price implications. We forecast China's overall maize demand to rise by 3.8% in 2017/18, and by a further 5.8% in 2018/19, as maize use in industrial processing begins to accelerate.

Supply
World maize supplies (production plus carryover stocks) have increased to record highs in recent seasons, topping 1bn tonnes most years since 2011/12. Encouraged by high market prices, production gains have stemmed from increases in plantings, as well as improved yields, with growers using new seed varieties, fertilisers and better farming practices to great effect. After surging by an estimated 10.7% in 2016/17, global output is projected to drop by 4.3% in 2017/18. Boosted by ample carryovers from 2016/17, global supplies are still likely to remain comfortable, especially in the major exporting countries, where traders are likely to compete hard for available business. Forecasts for 2018/19 remain highly provisional, especially in the southern hemisphere, and will be subject to revision in the coming months. Overall, we expect global output to be flat in that season as a modest expansion in area is offset by lower yields.
A weak La Niña appears to be forming
Some of the world's leading meteorological agencies, including the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently indicated the presence of a weak La Niña weather event, which is likely to persist until February-April 2018. Previous La Niña have sometimes been linked to drier than normal weather in southern Brazil and northern Argentina, two important maize producing areas. In contrast, La Niña normally brings beneficial rains to parts of southern Africa, a factor that lifted South Africa's 2016/17 maize crop to a record high. With a long way still to go in the southern hemisphere cropping season, it is still too early to adjust our crop forecasts solely on the basis of these updated long-range weather outlooks. However, with South American crops now playing a central role on the world market, the situation will be kept under close scrutiny in the months ahead.
US output will drop in 2017/18, but by a lower margin than expected
In its mid-month supply and demand update, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided additional downside impetus to an already bearish maize market, raising its nationwide yield estimate by 2% from October to 11 tonnes/ha. With upgrades for all key states apart from Nebraska, average productivity is now forecast to be at its highest ever, lifting production to 370.3m tonnes in 2017/18, almost 8% higher than the average annual outturn in the last five seasons. However, because of a drop in plantings, total output will still be down by about 4% from the 2016/17 record. While the USDA has maintained a generally optimistic outlook throughout the growing season, many other forecasters, were more cautious because of poor weather earlier in the season. However, temperatures cooled in August, before warming again in September, thereby extending the growing period and helping to offset some of the effects of previous unfavourable conditions. The latest hybrid maize seeds, in combination with better farming practices and equipment, have allowed crops to perform well even under short periods of adverse weather. With crop development lagging behind average for much of the season, this year's harvest has been the slowest in around three years. There are some issues with above-normal moisture content in some states, which may necessitate costly mechanical drying. In areas where storage facilities are already close to capacity, there are concerns that soggy grain may be at risk of spoiling if it cannot be dried and stored correctly.
Planting decisions for 2018/19 will once again depend on price relationships with alternatives, mainly soybeans, in the spring. After two seasons of losing ground to soybeans, 2018/19 rotation needs could favour maize sowings, especially if fertiliser prices stay low. However, the current heavy maize supply outlook means any upside is likely to be limited. For the time being, we expect a 2% rise in seedings, enough for a crop of around 361.8m tonnes, down by about 2% year on year.
Southern hemisphere harvests are expected to be smaller in 2017/18
Planting of 2017/18 maize crops began in September in some parts of South America, with fieldwork stretching through until February. The heavy supply outlook and current weak market prices suggest that a pullback in area is likely. Assuming a normalisation of yields, cumulative production in the three top exporters could decline by about 8%, to 156.5m tonnes.
Lower area, smaller yields in Brazil
The price outlook in Brazil is especially weak, with average local prices down by more than 40% year on year. Potentially better returns from soybeans mean that more area in the south of the country is likely to be diverted to oilseeds. A recent report from the Mato Grosso Institute of Agriculture Economics (Imea) predicts that 2017/18 safrinha (second crop) output in Mato Grosso, the country's single largest producing state, could decline by almost 20% year on year. The projected decline is linked to increasingly poor returns and follow-through delays from late soybean planting in the state. Imea's projection is more pessimistic than currently assumed by the country's official crop agency and could imply some downside risk to our current forecast, which does not assume such a steep drop in safrinha plantings. The situation will become clearer closer to the start of safrinha sowing, due to start after soybeans are harvested in February. We expect the outturn to fall to 91m tonnes in 2017/18, down by 7% year on year.
Similarly, a slump in South African prices means that sown area is likely to decline by around 7%. Based on average yields, the crop could drop by 29%, to 12.5m tonnes. The situation in Argentina is somewhat different. Encouraged by the farm-friendly policies of the Macri administration, producers are expected to boost plantings, with output down by only 1m tonnes from the previous season, at 40m tonnes. For 2018/19 we anticipate a modest expansion in South American crops but another static year in South African output.

Ukraine and Russia have become big players on the world market
Maize production in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has increased massively during the past decade, rising from around 21.7m tonnes in 2008/09 to an estimated 42.3m tonnes in the current season. Nearly all of the growth stems from much larger harvests in Ukraine and more recently, in Russia, with the other countries still relatively small producers. In 2016/17 maize overtook wheat as Ukraine's biggest export crop by volume, and the country now ranks as the world's fourth-largest exporter, behind the US, Brazil and Argentina. After peaking at a record 30.9m tonnes in 2013/14, production has edged lower in subsequent years as plantings fell back slightly. The 2017/18 harvest is estimated at 25m tonnes, 10.7% lower than the record 2016/17 crop, and slightly lower than the five-year average. With a strong export base expected to encourage plantings early next year, output is forecast to rebound to 27.5m tonnes in 2018/19.
Russia has traditionally been only a small producer of maize, with output dropping to a low of 3.1m tonnes in 2010/11. However, like the situation in neighbouring Ukraine, harvested area has nearly tripled over this period, to a new peak of 2.9m ha in the current season. Owing to disappointing yields, production in 2017/18 is expected to dip to 14m tonnes, down by 8% from last season's record but still 18% above the recent average. This will limit this season's exportable surplus to around 4.2m tonnes, still enough to retain the country's position as the world's fifth-largest exporter.
Stocks and prices
Owing to the upgraded US figure, we have raised our forecast for global maize stocks in 2017/18 slightly, to 329m tonnes (324m tonnes previously), down by just 0.7% year on year. Following a detailed reassessment of China's maize supply and demand numbers over the past decade, we recently raised our estimate of world stockpiles by 60%. Maize production in China is trending lower, and with consumption expected to rise strongly in the years ahead, it has become clear that our previous forecast was too conservative and would have resulted in the depletion of China's stocks in just a few years. With feed use adjusted lower from 2011/12 onwards, projections for China's stocks were lifted across the whole period and are now forecast at 201m tonnes at the end of 2017/18, a figure much closer to that circulating in the local press. We now expect China to account for 62% of total world stocks (40% previously). Yet with so much uncertainty about the size, location and quality of its stocks, many analysts prefer to exclude China when modelling world inventories. Combined stocks in the four main maize exporters (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and the US) are forecast to remain above the recent average in 2017/18, at a total of 76.2m tonnes, up by 5.2% year on year, with more than three-quarters of these concentrated in the US. A relatively sharp drop is predicted in 2018/19, to 310m tonnes. Although exporter stocks will also tighten further, overall market supplies will remain at comfortable levels.
China's stock estimate is revised sharply higher
China's grain stocks have long been considered a state secret, with all parts of the grain balance sheet quite notional and based on limited information. Sometimes the assumptions are proven to be incorrect, as highlighted by new information or a change in underlying market conditions. Although our revised stock forecast diverges from those of the USDA and other major forecasting bodies, it brings stocks in China much closer to the levels that have been widely reported in the local press in recent years, including figures quoted by key policy advisers and other Communist Party officials. We expect stocks to be drawn down further in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry. However, given that these stocks are primarily held as a domestic food security measure, and with China being only a small importer, this is unlikely to influence global prices.

With consumption failing to keep track with the surge in supplies, US ending stocks are expected to rise for a fifth consecutive season by the end of 2017/18, reaching 63.2m tonnes, an 8.5% year-on-year gain. The stocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 20%, up by four percentage points from the season before and the highest since 2005/06, suggesting that supplies are very comfortable. Based on early projections for the next season, including another large crop and a marginal drop in consumption, carryover stocks are projected to decline by around 3m tonnes, to 60.2m tonnes, still well above average. After a series of huge US crops, a grain storage crunch has been reported in many states in recent years, with many farmers reluctant to sell at low prices. Kansas has faced a particularly acute shortage, partly because of producers switching area from lower-yielding wheat to maize crops. However, shortfalls have been noted in the traditional maize states of Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska too. Plastic silo bags have been a quick, low-cost solution for many growers, allowing grains to be stored cheaply directly on the farm. While this offers logistical advantages, allowing farmers to avoid storage and handling fees, the maize being stored must already be at the desired moisture content and the silo bags still require active monitoring in order to avoid rupture losses.
Prices are unlikely to show any significant growth in 2018-19
World maize prices have eased slightly in recent months, averaging 9% lower year on year in late November. Although US export prices were initially pulled higher by concerns about worse than normal Midwest crop conditions, early summer gains have eroded as participants shed speculative long positions on signs that final yields would outperform earlier expectations. Light seasonal harvest pressure has also weighed on markets recently as newly harvested supplies added to bountiful US stockpiles, with speculative non-commercial funds establishing a record net short position in CME corn futures. Export prices in South America ticked slightly higher in recent weeks, as farmers there become more reluctant sellers given heightened concerns about recent dry weather, possibly linked to a La Niña weather event. Although upside risk remains, if a damaging weather pattern were to emerge over the coming months, maize market fundamentals currently point to a low price environ-ment. We expect prices to rise slightly from the fourth quarter of 2017; however, given ample global stocks and easy feedgrain availabilities, prices are likely to stay well below recent peaks in 2018-19.

Palm oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global palm oil consumption to accelerate over the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons, by 2.6% and 3.3% respectively. Nonetheless, these growth rates remain fairly moderate, below the previous five-year average of 4.5%. With the exception of sunflowerseed oil, palm oil's discount to other major oils is above normal levels which will stimulate additional consumption. However, negative sentiment against palm oil and palm oil-based biodiesel in the US and EU continues to weigh on demand there. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are looking for growth opportunities, with the biodiesel market in China the most likely to generate demand.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
Changes in duties applied to imported palm oil will constrain Indian consumption growth in 2017/18. Nonetheless, strong overall GDP growth in the coming seasons will help to support demand. We have raised our forecast for 2017/18 palm oil consumption slightly, to 5% (4.8% previously), a growth rate in line with recent averages. We expect a similar growth rate, of 4.5%, in 2018/19, bringing consumption up to a total of10.3m tonnes.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post decent growth in 2016/17 and 2017/18
Prospects for palm oil demand in Indonesia have been encouraged by recent increases in forecasts of prices for mineral oil. However, the biodiesel industry in Indonesia is searching for new markets to make up for the loss of sales in the US. The recent implementation by the EU of reduced duties for Argentinian biodiesel is expected to be followed by a similar reduction for Indonesian biodiesel. A decision by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on EU anti-dumping duties on Indonesian supplies is expected in December 2017. At this stage, we maintain our forecast that Indonesia's palm oil consumption will expand by 6.1% in 2017/18, to 9.8m tonnes. In 2018/19 we expect lower demand for biodiesel exports to limit Indonesia's palm oil consumption growth to 2.8%, to just over 10m tonnes.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by competition from soybean oil
Palm oil will continue to face strong competition from soybean oil in China in 2017/18. However, there is some hope of recovery in 2018/19, owing partly to a sustained recovery in instant noodle production, as higher quality products have rekindled consumer interest. More significantly, the planned expansion of biodiesel use has the potential to absorb large quantities of palm oil. Rising demand for biofuels underpins our forecast for steady demand growth of 3.7% per year on average in 2017/18-2018/19, to reach a total of 5.4m tonnes in the 2018/19 season.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
The market for palm oil in the EU has been broadly flat since 2013/14, hovering around 7.2m tonnes. However, EU consumption is likely to slip modestly during the forecast period. In the biodiesel sector, palm oil faces increased competition in some member states from recycled fats and oils, while sustainability concerns hang over medium-term consumption prospects. Palm oil imports in the season to date are marginally above year-earlier levels, although this is thought to be mainly to replenish low stocks. We forecast EU palm oil consumption to slip marginally, to 7.1m tonnes. Biodiesel consumption in the EU is expected to increase over the next two years, reflecting changes in incorporation mandates. While other feed-stocks are likely to be the main beneficiaries of this growth, palm oil consumption volumes should be maintained. Palm oil's use in the edible sector is also likely to be maintained, and as a result we expect consumption to remain fairly flat in 2018/19.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia faces challenges
Malaysian palm oil consumption was hampered in 2016/17 by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. These delays are unlikely to be resolved in the near future, despite government efforts to get the B10 mandate accepted by automobile manufacturers. However, there are reports of increasing biodiesel exports. Despite this, we have made a further small reduction in our forecasts for consumption in 2017/18 and 2018/19 to reflect the sluggish growth for biodiesel in local markets.
Prospects for palm oil consumption in other countries are broadly positive
The top five consumers account for less than 55% of global demand, and a large number of other countries also consume palm oil. A number of these countries are the target of palm oil exporters, especially in Africa and the Middle East. For example, recent reports highlight strong growth in palm oil imports into Ghana. The largest of these "other" consumers, Pakistan, is also showing steady growth in palm oil consumption. Attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been largely unsuccessful since neither sunflowerseed nor rapeseed fit in with more profitable crops. By 2018/19 Pakistan's palm oil consumption should be at almost 3m tonnes, similar to expected consumption in Malaysia. Buying activity from these other consumers is reported to be increasing, supporting steady consumption growth over the forecast period.

Supply
Our forecast of global palm oil output in 2017/18 remains virtually unchanged, at 68.9m tonnes. A small reduction in our estimate of output in Indonesia is offset by small increases for Malaysia and Colombia. At 4.9%, our production growth forecast for 2017/18 is in line with the previous five-year average. In 2018/19 we expect growth to slip further, to a marginal 1.2%, owing to the impact of stressed trees and a slowdown in mature areas growth.
Yields in Indonesia are slowly recovering from the 2015/16 drought
There has been a further increase in estimates of Indonesia's palm oil output in 2016/17. The most recent data indicate production of 36.3m tonnes, more than 15% higher than the previous season. The age profile of Indonesia's oil palms explains the strong rise in yields, which have outstripped those in all other palm oil producers. Yields are likely to rise further in 2017/18, albeit at a slower rate. We forecast production of 37.7m tonnes, representing a below-average growth rate of 3.8%. In 2018/19 the larger mature area is likely to offset any negative effects from the slower rate of planting. We forecast output of 38.6m tonnes in 2018/19. This forecast represents yields below trend; the relatively low prices are likely to result in low usage of crop inputs.
Malaysian production is set to return to 2013/14 peak by 2017/18
The recovery in Malaysia's October palm oil production mentioned in our last issue has been substantially exceeded by the official estimate of production in that month. Recorded output has been put at 20% higher than October 2016. Over the 2017/18 season as a whole, we expect Malaysian palm oil production to reach 20.3m tonnes (20.2m tonnes previously). Given the difficulties of finding new land for planting, growth in Malaysian output relies on replacing ageing trees with younger, higher-yield trees. The rate of replanting in recent years has been too low to prevent a slump in yields. As a result, we expect yields to be comparatively low in 2018/19, at 20.2m tonnes, especially as input use is likely to contract.
For Thailand, we expect an increase in the mature area to ensure continued growth in palm oil output in 2017/18, despite low prices inhibiting the use of crop inputs. We forecast output of 2.2m tonnes, marginally above 2016/17 levels. Difficulties in securing new land for planting will inhibit future growth, although the improving age profile will help yields. The slow growth in palm oil output is expected to result in a lower target for biodiesel use in Thailand. We expect Colombian output to grow steadily over the forecast period as its mature area expands. The recent peace agreement with the FARC may open up even more land for palm oil cultivation. Recent yields have largely been above year-earlier levels, and returns to the crop have been favourable. A higher biodiesel incorporation rate mandate should also help to maintain interest in the crop.

Stocks and prices
Recorded palm oil stocks in Malaysia and Indonesia have continued to increase. With palm oil production now set to reduce seasonally, stocks are likely to remain comparatively tight for the first half of the 2017/18 season. However, over the season as a whole, the market surplus will be greater than in 2016/17 and will allow stocks to recover to higher than normal levels. At the end of the 2017/18 season we expect that palm oil stocks will be at the equivalent of 71 days of average consumption, a level similar to that at the end of the 2014/15 season. Current projections suggest that stocks will continue to rise in 2018/19.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further in 2018
Physical prices for palm oil increased in November, helped by rising prices for other oils, especially for rapeseed oil. Futures prices have been relatively stable from September to the end of October, but have since declined. We expect physical prices to follow the downward trend in futures prices and to be persistently weak throughout the 2017/18 season. However, there remain significant uncertainties about the prospective increases in production, and markets are likely to show only small declines until evidence of the production growth is more firmly established. Given the seasonal decline in palm oil production, which typically lasts until February, price falls during the first and second quarters of 2018 may be relatively modest. Price declines are likely to be larger during the second half of 2018 and into 2019. By the end of 2019, prices are forecast to be below US$600/tonne, a low not seen since the end of 2015.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
Higher international prices for rapeseed oil are having a negative effect on consumption, despite an anticipated rise in mineral oil prices over the forecast period. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global rapeseed oil consumption to contract for the third consecutive year in 2017/18, by 1.7%, to only 24.7m tonnes. This is well below the 27m tonnes recorded in 2014/15 and 2015/16. An expected recovery in rapeseed oil output will help to push consumption up by nearly 5% in 2018/19, to 25.9m tonnes, with all the major consuming countries recording growth with the exception of India. However, low stocks are likely to prevent faster consumption growth.
EU consumption in 2016/17 will be limited by availability
Rising imports of Argentinian biodiesel are already having a negative effect on EU rapeseed oil consumption in 2017/18. An expected resumption of Indonesian biodiesel imports in mid-2018 will also be problematic. In addition, sunflowerseed oil will continue to provide strong competition in the food sector. On the positive side, a forecast increase in mineral oil prices from 2018 will be supportive of EU rapeseed oil demand. We have made a small upward revision to our forecast to reflect this but we do not expect EU consumption to reach the 10m-tonne mark (last seen in 2015/16) during the forecast period. An increase in domestic production of rapeseed oil in 2018/19 should allow consumption to grow, by a modest 0.6%, as the competitive pressures on rapeseed oil persist.
Demand in China will be aided in 2018/19 by the release of reserve stocks
In China, limited stocks of rapeseed will exert negative pressure on potential consumption. Imports of rapeseed oil to date have been disappointing, although these have been partly offset by higher imports of canola for local crushing. At 5.1m tonnes, rapeseed oil consumption in 2017/18 will be at its lowest level over the past decade. The forecast is vulnerable to any change in price differentials, especially between rapeseed oil and palm oil (the latter is currently trending upward). Any increase in consumption in 2018/19 relies on a recovery in local availability. Rapeseed remains a relatively unprofitable crop, and the planting area in 2017/18 was further hit by poor conditions. We expect the planted area to rise again to normal levels in 2018/19, which would allow a recovery in local availability, consistent with our consumption forecast of 5.8m tonnes.
India's consumption will rebound in 2016/17 in line with local availability
An improving outlook for domestic availability, together with strong real GDP growth levels, should stimulate rapeseed oil consumption in India during 2017/18. However, the continuing increases in import duties on vegetable oils may cause increases in internal prices, which could dampen any consumption growth. We have retained our 2017/18 forecast of consumption in excess of 2.5m tonnes. However, this forecast implies an increasing volume of rapeseed oil imports and is therefore vulnerable to changes in international rapeseed oil availability and competition from other oils.
Only modest demand growth is likely in the US market
Imports of rapeseed oil into the US continue to sustain consumption growth. The recent application of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia could stimulate additional demand for rapeseed oil as a feedstock during the forecast period. Overall, we expect US rapeseed oil consumption to continue to grow steadily, to reach 2.9m tonnes in the 2018/19 season. Several smaller consumers have switched away from rapeseed oil during 2016/17-a pattern that is likely to continue into 2017/18 as a result of its comparatively high price relative to other oils. A recovery in consumption among these "other" consumers is now expected to be delayed until 2018/19.

Supply
We expect a further, although marginal, decline in global rapeseed oil production in 2017/18. Our revised assessment puts total output at 24.5m tonnes, down by 0.8% year on year (from a decrease of 1.1% previously). There remains significant uncertainty over crop sizes, mainly in Canada and Australia. Assuming that current forecasts are realised, stocks of rapeseed/canola would allow a small increase in oil production. The main reduction occurs in the large number of "other" producers (including Mexico, Japan and Pakistan) who are expected to respond to higher prices of rapeseed with smaller crush volumes. Output in 2018/19 will, of course, depend on a recovery in rapeseed production. A return to normal yields will be the main element of any increase and would allow a significant jump in rapeseed oil output in 2018/19. We forecast output of 25.9m tonnes.
The EU rapeseed crop will recover only partially in 2017/18
Despite the small local crop, EU rapeseed crushers managed to produce more than 10m tonnes of rapeseed oil during 2016/17, only marginally below the 2015/16 total. Output in the 2017/18 season should also easily exceed 10m tonnes given that EU farmers have produced almost 22m tonnes of rapeseed. Current rapeseed import levels are running well above year-earlier levels, although these rates are likely to slow later in the season given the small Australian crop. Our current output forecast is consistent with lower import levels over the season as a whole. Reports suggest a small drop in winter rapeseed sowings in the EU despite favourable prices for rapeseed compared with wheat. Poor weather at sowing time is responsible for the fall. Our forecast of 2018/19 rapeseed oil production is lower, and now stands at 10.6m tonnes, just below the record output of 10.7m tonnes recorded in 2014/15.
Chinese production will fall in 2016/17
The uncertainty surrounding estimates of the Chinese rapeseed crop continues. We estimate just over 5m tonnes for the 2017/18 rapeseed crop. China's rapeseed oil production increasingly relies on imported rapeseed/canola through the additional capacity located at ports. We continue to forecast 2017/18 rapeseed oil production to be only marginally higher than that of 2016/17, at 3.6m tonnes. Output at this level implies a significant increase in rapeseed imports which may be difficult to achieve. Although rapeseed oil and rapeseed prices are likely to be higher, it remains unclear whether Chinese farmers will respond by higher plantings for the 2018/19 season. Instead, it is more likely that higher rapeseed oil production for the 2018/19 season will require yet more imports. We forecast oil output to expand to almost 4m tonnes for 2018/19.
Canada's 2016/17 harvest may be below expectations
Despite the early harvest, the size of the 2017 Canadian canola harvest remains uncertain. Statistics Canada releases its final harvest estimate in December, but trade estimates put the total higher than previously thought, at more than 20m tonnes. Assuming that this higher estimate is confirmed, Canadian crushing during 2017/18 will expand from previously projected levels. We have increased our estimate of Canadian canola oil production to just over 4m tonnes. Canola remains an attractive crop to Canadian farmers, and we assume an expansion of the planted area in 2018/19 to levels similar to the 2012/13 record. Normal yields should allow canola oil output to rise further, to 4.2m tonnes.
India's production is poised for a rebound in 2016/17
In India, 2016/17 rapeseed oil production of 2.1m tonnes was well below potential output based on the size of the rapeseed crop that season. The higher carry-in stocks of rapeseed will be required to maintain domestic rapeseed oil production. The monsoon season was recorded as normal and should, in principle, allow at least average yields for the 2017/18 rapeseed crop. However, there was significant regional variation in the rainfall totals, and the distribution of rainfall was weighted towards the early part of the season. Estimates of rape-seed sowings suggest that the area planted is about 10% lower than normal. Estimates of the size of the 2017/18 rapeseed crop therefore err on the cautious side. Normal yields would result in a crop of 6.1m tonnes. This would allow only a modest increase in 2017/18 rapeseed oil production, to 2.2m tonnes.

Australian production is likely to fall in 2017/18 owing to dry conditions
There is considerable uncertainty over the 2017/18 canola crop in Australia, with estimates ranging from 2.6m tonnes to 3.2m tonnes. It appears that yields in Western Australia may not be as bad as previously feared, but the harvest in the eastern states has been hampered by poor weather. We forecast 3m tonnes for 2017/18, well below the 4.4m tonnes harvested in 2016/17 and the lowest total since 2010/11. In Ukraine, official estimates of the 2017/18 rapeseed crop put the total at 2.2m tonnes. With winter planting now ended, the area of winter rapeseed has further expanded, with the crop in generally good condition.
Stocks and prices
We expect to see the global market remain in deficit in 2017/18, for the fourth consecutive season. However, revisions to supply and consumption forecasts this month mean that the deficit is lower, at only 200,000 tonnes (560,000 tonnes previously). At the end of the 2017/18 season, rapeseed oil stocks (when measured against consumption), will be the equivalent of 23 days' consumption, a low not seen since the 2006/07-2007/08 seasons. However, rapeseed stocks will remain available during 2017/18 and could result in higher crushings than currently expected. On the supply side of the seed market, the only major uncertainty is the size of the Indian crop to be harvested in the February-April 2018 period. Our current forecast suggests that the market will be near balance in 2018/19. However, this can only be achieved through low rapeseed stocks.

Low stocks will put upward pressure on prices from late 2017
Physical prices of rapeseed oil increased significantly in November-indeed, they recorded the largest increase among the major vegetable oils. Futures markets for canola/rapeseed in Canada and Europe both increased through to mid-November, but have eased somewhat since. Sustained price rises are the most likely course for rapeseed oil prices, although price gains will be limited by the high availability of other oils. However, prices look set to rise persistently, to reach US$940 by the end of 2018. Further price rises during 2019 could see prices edge up towards US$975/tonne.

Rice
Demand
With human consumption of rice continuing to drive up overall use in Asia, where populations are rising, global rice demand is expected to reach a new high of 494m tonnes in 2017/18, up by almost 1.6% from the previous season. As in the past, relatively small volume increases are likely in other regions, such as Africa and South America. However, other components of demand, such as feed and the industrial sector, are expected to contract. The outlook for the 2018/19 season depends on factors that will remain unknown for quite some time, such as policy frameworks, local crop outcomes and import needs. As such, our projection of 502m tonnes rests on the assumption that annual consumption growth will return close to trend.
Trade in rice will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2017
Africa and Asia account for three-quarters of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa particularly, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. With buyers in those regions expected to remain active in the global market, trade is projected to continue to grow in the next two years, to reach 44.5m tonnes in 2019, the largest volume on record. However, growth will be relatively marginal, as it is assumed that many Asian buyers are likely to be well stocked after the heavy purchases in 2017/18. Further strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. With the bulk of that now sold, demand should taper.
China's needs are expected to be central to the rice trade in 2018-19
China is the world's largest consumer of rice by far, accounting for about 30% of global demand. The bulk of national consumption is made up of locally produced rice, but in recent years China has also become the biggest importer of rice, mainly of high-quality broken types from Thailand and Vietnam. Prices for domestic long-grain milled rice still command hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China, supporting China's import demand.
Lower duties will encourage rice imports by Bangladesh in 2018-19
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. Three domestic crops are cut each year, namely the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July) and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs are met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market. Bangladesh importers and millers have sought to get tariffs reduced as a means of boosting imports, primarily from Thailand and India, with the latter typically the largest supplier in recent years. The country has recently entered into a long-term arrangement with Vietnam for up to 1m tonnes of imports per year until 2022. Trade reports have also highlighted the possibility of significant purchases from Myanmar.
The government is looking to boost rice imports to build reserves and rein in local prices after flash floods hit domestic output. To this end, the government announced a tariff reduction from 28% to 10% on rice imports in mid-2017.
The Philippines may be a large buyer, as state reserves are historically low.
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in about a decade. By contrast, however, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain especially comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports progressed strongly over the course of 2017, with the total for the first six months of the year at 530,000 tonnes, an 80% increase on the same period of 2016. Purchases are likely to remain high in the following years.

Supply
Our forecast for world rice production in 2017/18 has been revised down further, by 3m tonnes, to 484m tonnes, representing a marginal retreat from the record of 2016/17. Although this would be the second largest crop ever harvested, with stellar outturns expected in much of Asia on the basis of area increases and better yields, the fall mainly reflects prospects for reduced output in India and the US. The outlook for 2018/19 is highly provisional. Nonetheless, given that only a small expansion of paddy plantings is likely, an increase in global output will almost certainly be dependent on better yields. At nearly 492m tonnes, the world outturn is projected to be up by 1.5% year on year. All of our scenarios assume continued state support to farmers in Asia and beneficial weather conditions.
The 2017 monsoon was 5% below average, reducing output slightly
India's main agricultural crops are cultivated during two distinct seasons: kharif crops are sown between June and October and rabi crops in November-December. Kharif crops, of which rice is by far the most important, are rain-fed and therefore critically reliant on monsoon precipitation, which typically arrives in the southern state of Kerala in early June and lasts for about four months, accounting for 70% of the country's annual rains.
In India, where the kharif-planting season was completed by early October, the area planted to paddy was slightly smaller year on year, but still fairly solid compared with the average of recent seasons. The 2017 monsoon was around 5% below the long-term average; taking into account its impact on yield potential in some regions, as well as prospects for the winter-sown rabi crop, we project total acreage to be broadly steady year on year. Accordingly, we have revised down slightly our forecast for full-year output in 2017/18, by a further 500,000 tonnes, to 108m tonnes, representing a small contraction year on year. Nevertheless, this should still ensure that availabilities for domestic use and exports are sufficiently comfortable. In 2018/19 everything will again depend on the pattern of the monsoon, which will begin around June 1st 2018.
India should remain the biggest rice exporter during the forecast period
Based on their continued robust pace to date, which has been supported by large ship-ments to Africa and South Asia, India's exports in 2017 are expected to reach 10.7m tonnes, making it the largest supplier to the world market for the sixth consecutive season. Shipments in 2018 are likely to be slightly smaller year on year, at 10.5m tonnes. We assume that in 2019 competition from Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam, will result in sales of 10.8m tonnes.
China's exports have expanded in 2017, mainly because of sales to Africa
Although China has emerged as the world's biggest importer of rice in recent years, it has, for the most part, been a tiny exporter. Over recent seasons its exports have fluctuated between 200,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes, with most heading to markets in Asia, including South Korea and Japan-these being part of minimum commitments to import by those nations under World Trade Organisation obligations. Shipments normally comprise mostly small and medium-grain varieties.
Exports could surpass 1m tonnes in 2017, before receding slightly
The current year has been much different, however, with unusually large shipments of long-grain rice recorded in each month. Data from the General Administration of Customs show that total (cumulative) exports in January-September reached around 890,000 tonnes, compared to just 239,000 tonnes in the same period of 2016, with particularly heavy deliveries to Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and Sierra Leone. It is unclear whether such high sales can be sustained, especially since some of these shipments may have come in the form of food aid. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that China is believed to sit on massive state reserves, of at least 120m tonnes on a paddy weight basis, despite a significant share of it being unfit for human consumption. China's exports have occasionally risen above 2m tonnes, notably in 2003, with much of the increase going to Africa and the Americas. For the 2017 year in full, volumes could be as large as 1.1m tonnes, but are likely to fall in 2018 and 2019.
Production prospects for 2017/18 in Thailand are positive
For many years Thailand was the biggest supplier of rice to world markets. However, a combination of its intervention buying programme in earlier years (beginning in late 2011) and heavy competition from India resulted in it losing that position. More recently, exports have been boosted by availabilities from the government's stockpile, but prospects for production will ultimately shape the country's exportable surplus over the next two years.
In the current season (2017/18) prospects for the main crop appear solid, with harvesting due to take place in the latter stages of the current year. Cultivation is currently in the reproductive stage and progressing well. Cummulative precipitation during 2017 is estimated to be around one-quarter higher than average, while the impact of flooding in September was minimal. Good water levels will also be important during the development of the irrigated, off-season crop, which will be threshed next year. Assuming the planted area is expanded in both seasons, total production is projected at 20.4m tonnes, up from 19m tonnes in the previous year and a five-year high. A further increase in main-crop sowings is projected to push output up to 22m tonnes in 2018/19.
The government will support farmers to store rice from the main harvest
In mid-September the Thai government approved a THB73bn (US$2.2bn) budget for 2017/18 on farm paddy pledging program to include main-crop rice varieties from November 1st 2017 through to the end of February 2018. The scheme is aimed at supporting domestic prices during the main crop harvest, with up to 2m tonnes of paddy set to be procured. The intervention price for white rice is 3% above that of the previous season. Additional measures have been announced, with farmers, millers and traders also receiving support in the form of subsidies and soft loans, as a means of encouraging participants to store rice through to 2018.
In mid-November 2017 the government announced the extension of a deadline to offload outstanding old rice stocks (estimated at about 2m tonnes) for animal feed and industrial use. The deadline for sales was pushed back into 2018, so as to counter the potential for oversupply in the local market, especially at a time when the main crop harvest is underway. Nevertheless, the fact that just a small amount of stocks remain to be sold represents a dramatic turnaround from May 2014 when the military administration inherited a stockpile of close to 19m tonnes. Exports of all varieties of rice totalled 9.2m tonnes during the first ten months of 2017, representing a strong increase on the same period of the previous year. For the year in full, we now expect Thailand to sell 10.3m tonnes, up from 9.9m tonnes in the previous calendar year owing to significant sales to markets in Africa, as well as to non-traditional buyers in Asia such as Bangladesh. In the coming years, volumes are likely to edge lower but stay high.
Vietnam faces competition from smaller and established exporters in Asia
Vietnam is a medium-sized rice producer but a major exporter. It typically accounts for 5-6% of global output but 15% of exports, making it the world's third-largest exporter behind India and Thailand. Vietnam's exporters have performed well in 2017, with bigger sales to a number of markets in Asia pushing up total volumes in January-November to a forecast 5.5m tonnes, around 25% higher than in the same period of the previous calendar year. Analysis of customs data show that, although exports to African nations were smaller year-on-year, China bought considerably bigger amounts from Vietnam, as did the Philippines, a longstanding traditional buyer. However, a real boon for the nation was firm demand from Bangladesh, a country that has tended to source its import requirements from India. However, the need to build stocks after local supplies came up short meant that the government diversified its origins for imports. We expect Vietnam to maintain its position as the world's third biggest exporter in 2018-19 and beyond, although volumes are unlikely to exceed 7m tonnes in any season, given continued heavy sales by India and Thailand, as well as growing competition from other, relatively small exporters such as Cambodia and Myanmar.
A much smaller crop will constrain US rice exports in 2017/18
The US rice harvest was completed during October. Based on a heavy drop in plantings, production in 2017/18 is officially estimated to have fallen to just 5.7m tonnes, down from 7.1m tonnes in the previous season. This would be the smallest outturn in more than two decades, and is expected to tighten availabilities for sale on the international market, notwith-standing a drop in domestic use. Nevertheless, the contraction will be limited by large opening stocks. Shipments in the local marketing year, starting on August 1st 2017, are forecast at 3.4m tonnes, down from 3.6m tonnes in the previous year. US rice is sold globally, but major markets, mainly for paddy (rough rice) exports, include Central and Latin America, owing to proximity.
A smaller crop is likely in Brazil in 2017/18 as yields retreat
Conab, the official supply agency of Brazil, released its first formal outlook for rice supply and demand in 2017/18 in early October. The southern state of Rio Grande do Sul is the most important producing region, accounting for the bulk of acreage. Together with other states, rice plantings for the 2017/18 crop, which will be harvested in the first half of the following year, was expected to hold steady compared to 2016/17, at around 2m hectares. But with the agency expecting yields to fall away from the previous year's level, production (paddy weight basis) was forecast to fall by 4% year on year, to 11.8m tonnes. Aside from the potential for bigger plantings in Rio Grande do Sul, there appears limited potential for an increase in area anywhere else in the country in the longer term. In 2018/19 production is expected to ease to 11.5m tonnes.
The South Korean rice sector is relatively small compared with India and China. The planted area has steadily fallen over a number of decades, although this has been partly offset by improved yields, helping production-of japonica varieties-to stay high enough to meet domestic consumption needs. The decline in seeding is linked to increased demand for land for residential and commercial purposes, as well as a switch to other relatively profitable cash crops. To this end, the government has also requested that local rice farmers cultivate other crops instead of paddy, with a rice reduction programme to be introduced in 2018.
Total rice consumption in South Korea is forecast at 4.9m tonnes in 2017/18, broadly equivalent to around 1% of global use, representing a modest increase from the year before. Although rice consumption by humans is declining owing to continued rising incomes and the increased inclusion of western foods in diets, feed use is likely to expand due to the existence of ample government stocks. According to industry reports, around 700,000 tonnes of rice is expected to be channelled into the feed sector in 2018.

Stocks and prices
Our forecast for global rice stocks remains unchanged, with inventories forecast to fall appreciably in 2017/18, to a seven-year low of 95.2m tonnes. Although we expect China's supportive policies for farmers to ensure another rise in inventories, this will be in contrast to falls in the major global suppliers, as well as in other countries. Inventories held by the world's leading exporters, which also include India, Pakistan, the US and Vietnam, are forecast at 22m tonnes, down by 5m tonnes year on year. This would be the smallest amount in a decade and highlights a global market that appears to be tighter than headline figures might suggest.
Stocks are expected to drop in the next two seasons on rising consumption
In 2018/19 although world output is still expected to climb from this season's record level, rising consumption will also cut into stocks, pushing them to another multi-year low of 85m tonnes. It is assumed that stockbuilding in China will continue, especially since imports are set to remain high, but exporters' reserves may fall once more, to just 21m tonnes, the bulk of which will be located in India.

Markets for export grades of white and parboiled rice in Asia exhibited contrasting trends during the month of November. Compared with October, quotations for broken rice in Thailand rose significantly; the 100% B grade rose by 5% to US$403/tonne fob Bangkok, the highest since the closing days of September. The pace of exports has provided some support to the market during 2017. Since it is understood that the Thai government has sold off all its food quality stocks, availability for the world market has become tight, especially with harvesting of the main season crop still ongoing.
In Vietnam, where exporters have enjoyed a solid year, quotations initially fell before edging up because of thin, old, crop stocks-highlighted by expectations that the end-season carry-over stocks expected will be much smaller year on year. As a result, prices on November 27th were steady compared with four weeks ago. In India, where the focus is on the main kharif crop harvest, export values have eased, with the 5% broken grade down by US$7, to US$393 fob.
In contrast, the US market for milled rice has recorded sharp gains in 2017, almost entirely due to a season in which domestic production has fallen significantly because of a large fall in long-grain plantings. In late November Gulf quotations for 4% broken stood at US$518/tonne fob, a shade higher than a month earlier but almost 30% above equivalent offers in November 2016.
Our price projections for Thailand's 100% B grade are again subject to some minor revisions, although this does not change the broader fundamental backdrop. In the final quarter of 2017 prices are expected to average US$385/tonne, feeding through to a full-year value of US$388/tonne, only a fraction above the previous year's average. Our supply and demand forecasts suggest there is potential for some upward pressure on prices as global supplies begin to tighten, owing to contractions in major exporters. By the fourth quarter of 2019 we forecast a price of US$425/tonne and, while this would equate to a five-year high, it would still be well below the levels witnessed in 2009-13. Another gentle rise to US$430/tonne is likely in the first quarter of 2020.

Soybeans
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts global consumption of soybeans to expand by 4.9% year on year 2017/18, to a record of 341m tonnes. This will partly be driven by rising demand for meat-and therefore animal feed ingredients, including high-protein oilseed meals-in China and many other Asian countries. Although we expect growth to slow relative to that in 2016/17, it will match the average of the two previous seasons. Looking beyond Asia, some smaller consuming regions, including the EU, Africa and the Middle East, will also contribute to rising demand. We expect a similar rate of demand growth in 2018/19, owing to rising usage in animal feed. However, uncertainty regarding crop yields poses a downside risk to this forecast.
We have revised up our forecast for global soybean trade slightly, to almost 150m tonnes in 2017/18. This will be the seventh consecutive year of expansion, due mostly to rising demand from China, as well as some smaller markets in Asia. With demand from these countries expected to increase again in 2018/19, trade could approach 155m tonnes in that season.
Feed usage will drive overall demand up and will mostly be met by imports
China is by far the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans, with growth largely driven by expanding demand from the country's vast animal feed sector. In 2017/18 we expect China's total consumption to reach a new record of 107m tonnes, representing impressive growth of about 8% and approaching one-third of the amount used globally. Imports are forecast to total 100m tonnes, or more than 90% of consumption, highlighting the global market's dependence on Chinese processors. Although the government is looking to boost local output, it seems that imports will continue to account for a dominant and possibly rising share of overall requirements, especially in feed sectors. Most of what is produced locally is likely to be channelled to food and other smaller markets.
China's imports in 2018/19 are expected to exceed 100m tonnes
Despite reports of large stocks of soybeans and associated pressure on crush margins, import demand growth has remained robust throughout 2017, with buyers encouraged by ample global supply and attractive prices. The outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, but China's full-season purchases are likely to reach 104m tonnes.
Nonetheless, the Chinese government's intention to end maize stockpiling, announced in 2016, remains a downside risk. The move aims to encourage the use of maize at the expense of other feed grains, which have been imported in great quantities in recent years. Higher maize consumption in the pork and poultry sectors could also raise questions surrounding the use of high-protein meals, primarily soybean meal. However, the impact is expected to be marginal, as soybean meal is the most abundantly produced oilseed meal, and provides both higher protein quality and nutritional value compared with alternatives.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
With another bumper crop expected to result in a further swelling of domestic supplies, US consumption in 2017/18 is forecast to remain close to the previous season's high, at 56m tonnes. Aside from local requirements, total use will be underpinned by rising exports of soybean meal. Similar trends will enable domestic demand to edge up in 2018/19, to 57m tonnes.
Soybean consumption in Argentina will continue to be driven by growing international demand for soybean meal, of which Argentina is the dominant supplier. In Brazil, further increases in consumption are anticipated as bigger local soybean crops boost supplies for processing.
Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successively larger record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes, domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall requirements, with combined imports of soybeans and soybean meal typically accounting for up to 35m tonnes. In 2017/18 imports of soybeans are likely to rise after the previous season's fall, but any increase is likely to be capped by a much better local rapeseed harvest. In 2018/19 and beyond, availabilities of alternatives, including rapeseed, will play a crucial role in determining volume requirements. Throughout the period we expect the region's soybean meal imports to remain above 20m tonnes, making it easily the world's largest buyer of soybean meal (while China remains the largest buyer of soybeans).

Supply
Although planting is now under way in Latin America's leading producers, considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for the global outturn in 2017/18. Never-theless, in the northern hemisphere another season of large harvests is expected, judging by completed and intended plantings and early field reports. We expect these factors to support the second-largest harvest ever.
A notable increase in the global planted area is expected, but yields are unlikely to be replicated at the record level that was achieved in 2016/17. Accordingly, production is forecast to fall marginally year on year, to 342m tonnes. In 2018/19 output could recover slightly, but would still fall a little short of the 2016/17 high: our projection of a 0.8% increase year on year, to 345m tonnes, reflects our assumption of a slight rise in sowings and trend yields.
US production in 2017/18 is likely to set a new record owing to a larger area
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects seeded area in 2017/18 to increase by around 7% year on year, to 36.2m ha, the largest on record. In addition to a switch of acreage from maize and spring wheat, expanded area also stems from a steep contraction in winter wheat sowings. Weather patterns during the current growing season were a cause for concern at times in parts of the Midwest, with dry and hot conditions in the east and the northern Plains, and excessive rains being a problem in eastern regions. It therefore seems likely that average yields will not match those of the previous year. Nonetheless, local official projections and recent field reports reflect a positive yield outlook.
At a record of 120.4m tonnes, output is expected to be almost 3% higher year on year in 2017/18. Together with high carryover stocks from the season before (which ends on August 31st), a crop of that size will ensure ample supplies for domestic use and export. We assume that recent delays to harvesting in parts of the Midwest will not have a detrimental effect.
US exports could establish a new record in 2017/18
US exports progressed strongly during the 2016/17 season, totalling 59m tonnes by August 31st 2017 (the close of the US marketing year), up by 5m tonnes from 2015/16. The solid pace was shaped by international demand from Asia, but also by a range of other, relatively small importers, including those in Africa and the Middle East. For 2017/18 we expect shipments to expand to at least 60m tonnes, a new record. Although the pace of sales has stepped up significantly in recent weeks, these remain well behind a year earlier. The slower pace is almost certainly linked to heavy shipments by Brazil, with some buyers hesitant to enter the world market, preferring to wait for northern hemisphere supplies to come on stream at attractive prices.
US growers are expected to reduce the area planted to soybeans in 2018/19
Planting intentions for 2018/19 in the northern hemisphere are tentative at this stage. In the US much will depend on relative prices at the time of planting, as well as crop rotation. Although there is an argument in favour of increased corn plantings at the expense of soybeans following 2017/18 seeding patterns, support for soybean acreage could come from the continued expansion of global trade, driven largely by China's needs. We anticipate that the area planted to soybeans in the US will fall by between 2% and 3% in 2018/19. Combined with yields, the outturn is projected at 114m tonnes, which is 5% lower than the previous season, but still the third-largest harvest on record.
A huge crop will be cut in Canada, with further increases likely in the long term
The area for harvest in Canada is estimated at a record of 2.9m ha in 2017/18, an unprecedented year-on-year expansion of 33%, driven by expanded acreage in the non-traditional growing areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, largely at the expense of wheat and canola. One of the key attractions is that Canadian growers are able to tap in to a fast-growing global market. Added to this, the crop requires less intensive application of inputs, such as fertilisers, compared with alternatives, and new varieties have been developed that can be cultivated in areas that were previously unsuitable. Despite the significant expansion of seeded area, some reduction in yields is expected, especially as earlier reports from Manitoba and Saskatchewan pointed to difficulties with crop development owing to challenging weather conditions. According to Canada's Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, output is expected to increase by 1.5m tonnes to 8m tonnes in 2017/18. Exports are projected to rise to 5.6m tonnes, up from 4.4m tonnes in the previous season.
Brazil's exports are likely to smash previous records in 2017/18
Brazil's huge 2016/17 crop boosted availabilities to record levels and, given expected growth in trade, positioned Brazil to export significantly larger volumes in the local marketing year (which closes at end-January 2018). Our forecast remains unchanged, and we believe that total shipments could reach a record of 62m tonnes, up by 12.3% from the previous year. A marked rise in domestic prices in Brazil is unlikely, given current conditions, which means that farmers are likely to finish the season with larger than normal stocks.
After a sluggish start to the 2017/18 planting season in Brazil, progress has since been improved-especially during November, following the arrival of beneficial rains in central growing states. As at November 27th Ag Rural, a leading local consultancy, estimated plantings to be complete on 84% of the intended area, 5 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. In the main producing states of Parana and Mato Grosso, fieldwork was close to being finished. However, concern remains about a developing La Niña and its potential impact on crops there, as well as in Argentina, where conditions are already drier than normal. Moreover, Brazilian weather forecasters have pointed to the increased chance of a La Niña event, with drier than normal conditions in southern Brazil in December to February, and normal to above-normal rainfall in central Brazil.
Growth in sowings in Brazil is expected in 2017/18, but may be limited by low prices
With plenty of land available, a further expansion of soybean area in Brazil is expected in 2017/18, of 2% year on year, to 34.5m ha. Nevertheless, downside risks remain. It seems likely that, despite the area increase, some growers could scale back expenditure on essential inputs to minimise costs. However, maize prices in Brazil are signficantly below year-earlier levels-having fallen by a larger margin than soybean prices did-which makes it likely that some farmers will have switched a portion of their intended primary, or full-season, maize cropland to soybeans. With yields unlikely to be near those achieved in 2016/17, we forecast output to fall slightly in 2017/18, by 5% year on year, to 108m tonnes. Planting of the 2018/19 crop will not begin until mid-September 2018, so the outlook is highly provisional. Based on further area expansion and trend productivity, output could be close to the 2016/17 high.
Production in Argentina could fall in 2017/18 on potential area declines
Fieldwork for Argentina's 2017/18 crop is well under way and was estimated by the Bolsa Cereales to be about one-third complete by November 22nd, matching the previous season's progress. However, satellite images and local reports indicate that conditions are still too dry in the provinces of Cordoba and Sao Luis, with concerns, too, about parts of Santa Fe, Entre Rios, and northern Buenos Aires. Generally, the driest areas are in the western and north-western production areas, but dry conditions are now becoming an issue in the core regions too. Even if dryness resulted in some crop damage, there is still time to recover later in the growing season if the weather is mostly favourable. The critical time for the crop is during the pod-filling period-typically around February/March for Argentina.
With relatively better returns for maize, growers are expected to favour plantings of the grain over soybeans. With some area reduction likely, and together with a fall in average yields, production is projected to drop by 3.5m tonnes year on year for 2017/18, to 53m tonnes. Although the government is expected to reduce export levies gradually over the course of 2018-19, the crop will still not be as an attractive as other options.
China's output is rising, but still only meets a fraction of domestic demand
Despite being the world's largest importer by far, China is only a minor producer of soybeans. Its potential has been capped by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players, as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, corn and rice. Nonetheless, in August 2016 the Chinese authorities published a National Oilseed Development Plan, which aims to boost domestic production to 60m tonnes by 2020. The scheme will provide support for oilseed production, processing, technical extension and innovation.
In 2016/17 total acreage was up by an estimated 10 % from the previous season, and a further increase is likely in 2017/18, with a portion of land coming from the switching out of corn production in north-eastern areas. Total output in that season is expected to rise to a peak of 14.3m tonnes, up from 13.1m tonnes in the previous year, and the same influences will underpin another increase in output to 15.2m tonnes in 2018/19.

Stocks and prices
World ending stocks in 2017/18 are forecast at 119.1m tonnes. Although this represents a further increase and would be an all-time peak, the actual rise from the previous season would be less than 1m tonnes (compared with an increase of about 22m tonnes in 2016/17). Should conditions worsen in any way in South America, the number for the combined end-of-year carryout would be reduced. In 2018/19 prospects are highly provisional, but world inventories are expected to tighten by more than 12m tonnes, dropping to a total of 106.8m tonnes.
Looking below top-line data, US ending stocks (based on end-August 2018) are forecast to rise to 11.6m tonnes, up from 8.1m tonnes at the end of the previous season, and the highest level since 2006/07. This is linked to the largest crop ever produced, despite growth in domestic consumption and international sales. Inventory build in the US will help to offset expected falls in both Argentina and Brazil, where 2017/18 crops are likely to be smaller year on year in the face of high exports and local consumption.

Global markets for soybeans were mostly stronger during the month of November, although day-to-day price movements were often small, with losses often offsetting gains. Chicago soybean futures were shaped by heightened worries about ongoing dry weather (often associated with a La Niña weather system) for crops in Latin America, with the most acute of those being in Argentina.
Markets were also influenced by export demand, technical activity and external influences, such as currencies. Nevertheless, quotations were kept in check by expectations for another season of ample supplies, tied to above-average output in leading exporting countries. This includes the US, where the harvesting of a record outturn was completed during November. The USDA's official supply and demand update was generally seen as bearish by traders and ensured that the potential for gains was limited. With export premiums showing little movement over the past four weeks, as the US harvest wrapped up, export prices were up only slightly, by 2%, to US$381/tonne fob. With South American markets shaped by US futures and the aforementioned supply-side concerns, export prices in Argentina and Brazil were similarly firmer.
Based on recent price trends and underlying fundamentals, our projections for prices over the next two years remain broadly unchanged. The final-quarter value is placed just US$4/tonne higher than in our last report, at US$379/tonne, resulting in just a US$1/tonne rise in the full year average price quotation. In the remainder of the outlook period, prices are expected to rise on mildly supportive fundamentals. However, our production outlook rests on the assumption of normal growing conditions across the full season in leading producing countries. Should crops fall significantly short of expectations in any of the main exporters, especially in Brazil in the early stages of 2018, there could be significant market support, pushing prices well above projected levels.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand by an average of 1.4% in 2017/18-2018/19 (October-September), roughly in line with the average over the past four seasons. Rising demand will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are adopting the food-and-drink habits of developed-world countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift, as a sweetener in food and beverages, and as a binding and preserving agent in processed foods. However, heightened awareness about the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put pressure on consumption growth. Amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products, a gradual shift towards synthetic sweeteners will somewhat lessen demand for sugar. Moreover, owing to the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market was liberalised in September 2017), these cheaper alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of relatively low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies in many developed countries and protectionist moves in several emerging markets, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
Although its demand growth will ease, China will remain a key consumer
Rising urbanisation and changing consumer tastes will continue to spur demand for sugar in China. We expect the rate of China's demand growth to ease in the coming years, in line with softening GDP growth; nonetheless, we have revised up our sugar demand projections slightly to reflect somewhat higher forecasts for income growth. However, consumption growth will be held back by the growing supply of starch-based sweetener, which is a cheaper rival to sugar in the beverages industry, and higher domestic sugar prices, which are a likely consequence of the government's moves to restrict imports. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government has reduced permits (to 1m tonnes, roughly half the previous level) and raised duties (from 50% to 95%) on out-of-quota sugar imports. Sugar imports fell by 26% year on year in the first ten months of 2017 as a result. China will continue to make purchases overseas, as it is unlikely to be able to scale up domestic production in 2017/18-2018/19 to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high level of stocks. With the government timing its import decisions to coincide with favourable global prices, this will cause occasional spikes in imports (as seen in October, when imports increased by some 60% year on year). However, while it will remain a significant player in the global market, China is unlikely to remain the world's largest importer under the current import policy environment.
Consumption in India is forecast to recover as prices normalise
Potential consumption growth in India was constrained in 2015/16 by high post-drought prices and unsupportive policy moves (including demonetisation and the removal of some consumer subsidies). However, we expect demand to recover over the coming years, reaching a record high of 25.7m tonnes in 2018/19. The near-term impact of protectionism on local prices, following the government's decision in mid-2017 to hike import duties (from 40% to 50%), will be muted by strong local harvests. Hence, as large domestic supplies from the 2017/18 crop hit the market, domestic prices will soften. This, together with rising incomes and further urbanisation, will support demand.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is positive. Some of the more developed countries, such as Malaysia and South Korea, are likely to grow only slowly as markets mature, but this will be more than offset by populous developing countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. However, demand growth in this region will be somewhat dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry to cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer) increases production and seeks export markets. Tax measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines could also dampen demand, with Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia pursuing plans to introduce a so-called sugar tax. This has the potential to put a sharp brake on demand; for example, the introduction of a sugar tax in Mexico in 2015 has contributed to a 12% drop in sugar demand since then. Nevertheless, we assume that any such policies in Asia will be rolled out only slowly over the coming years, amid concerns over restricting growth in the otherwise burgeoning food and drink manufacturing industries.
Health warnings may eventually dent sugar demand in the developed world
Demand growth in the mature EU market is likely to be sluggish in 2017/18-2018/19. Many EU countries already average far higher consumption levels of sugar than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), much of which is hidden in processed foods, and the EU Consumer Organisation is urging the food industry to take notice of WHO guidelines. So far, tax measures have been proposed to curb use in countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium. The policy response is likely to be watered down somewhat by opposition from the powerful food and drink industry, but consumer pressure is driving a gradual shift in the food industry toward lower sugar levels. More imminently, however, the liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farmgate prices and export caps were abolished-will limit the need for imports and bring European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. However, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based sweetener) was also liberalised in September 2017 and, as in the US, this is likely to steal market share gradually from sugar over the medium term. As well as the adjustment to the new liberalised regime, the UK's exit from the EU is generating uncertainty in the European sugar industry, as the UK is the largest importer of EU sugar.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase, with the bulk of growth coming from expanding indigenous supplies that make sugar more affordable. Several consumers (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. But inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. Health warnings could temper the pace of consumption growth, with South Africa set to introduce a sugar tax in April 2018. However, as in EU countries, this is meeting considerable resistance from its food and beverage industries, and there remains uncertainty over the level (and therefore the impact) of the tax. Moreover, with the tax evolving into a political row in South Africa between health consumers and business lobbyists, its experience is likely to deter other governments from following suit and a widespread roll-out on the sin tax across the continent seems unlikely.
Policy changes will shift the dynamics of the global sugar trade
The overhaul of EU sugar policy in 2017 is likely to have a significant effect on global trade patterns as the bloc transitions from being a net importer to becoming a net exporter. We expect this transition to be complete by the end of the 2017/18 season. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hardest hit by this shift. Global trade dynamics will also be affected by the introduction of heavy import tariffs in China, with small producers (exempt from the new tariffs) likely to increase their market share. Aside from China, trade patterns in Asia will be affected by the liberalisation of sugar sales under Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which comes into effect in 2018. This will probably cause less efficient producers (such as Vietnam) to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade is also likely to increase in North America, following a trade deal between the US and Mexico that came into effect in July. This tightened up the rules for Mexican producers and granted Mexico the right of first refusal for the US's above-quota import demand.
These trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by countries' preference for holding strategic stockpiles of sugar to hedge against future shocks. We therefore expect trade to increase in 2017/18 as countries (notably China) rebuild stocks after several years of low domestic production and relatively high global prices, before trade flows slow in 2018/19 on the back of large local harvests in markets that typically swing between net imports and net exports (notably India).

Supply
After fairly modest growth of 2.1% in 2016/17, and shrinking global supply in the two previous years, world sugar production is forecast to increase by 7.2% in 2017/18, to 179.8m tonnes. This is slightly higher than our previous forecast (6.8%) as the Russian harvest is outperforming expectations. Global supply will also be supported by strong crop revivals in India and Thailand, following weather-related shocks during the previous harvest, and strong output growth in the EU as producers seek to capitalise on the newly liberalised sugar regime. The world's largest producer, Brazil, will benefit from a second consecutive year of crop-friendly growing conditions in 2017/18 and, with a significant amount of output locked into generously priced forward contracts, the supply of cane to sugar production will remain above-average. In 2018/19 we expect global output to remain fairly flat, with a slowdown in Brazil offset by growth among most other producers. We now expect global production to rise by 0.8% in 2018/19 (0.1% previously), to a total of 181.3m tonnes, owing to higher projections in India and Russia. This is contingent on normal weather conditions; even fairly modest disruptions to rainfall patterns pose significant risks to the forecast.
Output growth in Brazil is in prospect as cane supply increases
Brazil is on course for a strong cane harvest, with volumes surpassing market expectations in the early months of the local 2017/18 season (April-March) and quality deteriorating only slightly as the harvest has progressed. With cane supply robust, the main factor shaping Brazil's sugar output will be the supply of cane for sugar vis-à-vis ethanol production. Mills have favoured sugar production in recent years, as ethanol demand waned during a period of low oil prices and weak economic growth. However, the government reduced a federal ethanol tax in late July, which is boosting ethanol demand and prompting crushers to divert cane back to the fuel industry. Indeed, less than 43% of cane supply was used for sugar production in the first half of November, down from over 50% in the first half of 2017. The overall diversion of cane to the sugar industry in 2017/18 will, however, still be above historical norms of 44%. In 2018/19 the weakness of the Real will support the attractiveness of the export-oriented sugar industry, but higher global oil prices and a modest economic recovery in Brazil will spur demand for biofuels. These counteracting factors will probably leave ethanol and sugar prices close to parity, and this is likely to bring the diversion rate in line with historical norms. However, sugar cane fields are ageing and field renewal rates are low. This will begin to take a toll on cane output from 2018/19, thereby reducing the overall cane crush. With a less favourable diversion rate and lower cane production, sugar output is therefore forecast to moderate to 38.6m tonnes in 2018/19, from 39.6m tonnes in 2017/18.
Strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
Production in India is poised for a strong recovery following drought-related supply disruptions in 2015/16-2016/17. We expect output to reach 26m tonnes in 2017/18 as growth is supported by stronger yields (particularly in the two main growing regions, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, where weather conditions are favourable) and an expansion of the crop area under cultivation (by some 5%). Industry officials in India anticipate another year of strong supply growth in 2018/19, with some forecasts as high as 30m tonnes. Planting will be encouraged in 2018/19 by decent farmgate prices in the previous season, while the wider use of high-yielding seed varieties will boost output. We have increased our 2018/19 production forecast to reflect these dynamics, but, with crushing capacity unlikely to increase as quickly as cane supply, we doubt sugar production will reach 30m tonnes. A medium-term threat to sugar production in India stems from the government's ambition to develop a biofuel industry, which could compete for cane supply. The draft biofuel policy restricts the diversion of cane to ethanol production to years of surplus production, but potential biofuel investors are unlikely to accept this restriction.
EU production will recover as the sugar regime is liberalised
In Europe sugar output is poised for brisk growth as producers seek to take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system. Under the new regime, which came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 season, producers (led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries) will extend their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity without significant additional investments. Extended crush seasons will be supported by higher supply of beet, with some integrated sugar companies reporting that the area under cultivation has been increased by some 15% year on year in 2017/18. Favourable weather conditions are also supporting the beet crop, with the authorities in France projecting a record high harvest in 2017/18. Higher supply and greater efficiency should also leave the region's main producers able to withstand lower prices as the price of European sugar falls closer to the global average. We therefore expect EU production to reach 18.8m tonnes in 2018/19, which will surpass EU demand and spur export growth.
In Russia, sugar production is expected to remain robust, following the significant investment in the modernisation of sugar factories in recent years. Output since the start of beet processing in August has exceeded our expectations (up by 13% year on year in mid-November), aided by favourable crop-growing conditions, and this has prompted an upward revision to our projections. The ensuing surplus will support Russia's emergence as a notable exporter, as the government seeks to prevent stock build-ups from depressing domestic prices and deterring planting. However, we think that the authorities' forecast that exports will reach almost 1m t/y is overoptimistic, owing to soft demand for imports in Central Asia (Russia's main market) and the country's limited output of high-value sugar (which is in higher demand globally).
Output in Thailand is recovering from El Niño's long reach
In Thailand, favourable rainfall will support a bumper harvest in 2017/18 of 11.9m tonnes. Assuming that rainfall normalises in 2018/19, we forecast a more moderate, albeit still decent, outturn of 10.5m tonnes. Producers will be incentivised by export opportunities to other Asian markets, where demand is rising and Thai sugar enjoys favourable access under the ASEAN free-trade arrangement. However, producers are facing considerable regulatory uncer-tainty. Following a challenge by Brazil, which argued that Thailand was violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free competition, the Thai government agreed to liberalise its sugar industry in December 2017. But the government is yet to legislate on these reforms and, since the removal of subsidies will coincide with a period of low global prices, the authorities are likely to rely on indirect mechanisms to support farmers. Nonetheless, increasing mechanis-ation will help to boost yields, and the sugar cane area will continue to expand as farmers turn away from less profitable rice crops. Risks to our Thai forecast are rising, as production moves towards more drought-prone interior regions.
A major recovery in China's sugar sector appears unlikely for now
China's sugar output has fallen sharply in recent years, owing to unfavourable weather and the impact of rapidly rising costs for labour, land and farm machinery. Amid political pressure from the local industry, some government support has been forthcoming in the form of input subsidies and soft loans, and the government has raised duties on out-of-quota sugar imports in a bid to protect local producers from cheaper imports. These measures will support the profitability of the local industry and should spur some investment, but we doubt that they will lead to a significant surge in domestic supply growth. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high and sugar cane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. Indeed, the cost of producing sugar cane in China is almost double that in Thailand, and this will deter investment. The government is attempting to encourage consolidation among the many disparate industry players in the country's main sugar region of Guangxi in an attempt to improve its competitiveness. However, similar moves in the past have not yielded impressive results. Given more favourable growing conditions, we expect output to rise modestly, to an average of 10.4m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19-well below the 10% annual growth that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals.

Stocks and prices
After successive supply deficits and a period of relatively high global prices, global sugar stocks shrank to 87.4m tonnes at end-2016/17. We expect the stocks to recover to 98.5m tonnes at end-2018/19 as the market swings back into surplus. The market surplus is forecast to reach 6.3m tonnes in 2017/18, amid bumper harvests from key producers, before moderating to 4.8m tonnes in 2018/19 as output remains flat and consumption accelerates slightly. Although overall stocks will remain comfortable (equivalent to an average of almost 55% of annual consumption in 2017/18-2018/19), the uneven distribution of these stocks means that reserves will not always be available to the market, and occasional supply squeezes are possible.

The latest sugar price rally has peaked
After peaking at over 23 US cents/lb in late 2016, global sugar prices fell by 30% over the first half of 2017, before stabilising in the third quarter, at 14.5 US cents/lb. In part, this reflects a market correction after overshooting in late 2016, with speculative investors unwinding the long positions that they had adopted during the price boom. More fundamentally, crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets are fuelling expectations of a global sugar surplus in the coming years, and policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably, China, India and Europe) have further weakened market sentiment. Amid oversupply in the global market, we expect prices to average 16 US cent/lb in 2017, down by 11% on the previous year.
Beyond 2017 we expect prices to drift higher, to between 15.5 US cents/lb and 16.5 US cents/lb in 2018-19. This modest price recovery from the nadir of mid-2017 will be driven largely by market tightening from 2018 as the crucial Brazilian market diverts more cane to ethanol production over the coming years and therefore produces less sugar. A swing to ethanol that is substantial enough to bring the global sugar market into balance seems unlikely, however, and the prospects of global oversupply will probably prevent a more significant rebound in prices. Nonetheless, our market surplus forecast is based on the assumption of normal weather conditions in all producing countries, and there therefore remains a risk of sharp supply shocks if crop conditions change. The sugar trading market is seemingly pricing in little risk at the moment, but, as the market tightens in 2018/19, we think that this will change. Higher-risk premiums will therefore probably provide some support to prices in 2019.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Demand for sunflowerseed oil remains strong as a result of attractive prices relative to other oils. The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast of sunflowerseed oil consumption in 2017/18 shows growth of 2.8% to 18.7m tonnes. Higher estimates of supply mean that the risk to consumption due to lack of supply is reducing. Sunflowerseed oil enjoys a strong consumer franchise in many countries, and this underpins our expectation of further consumption growth in 2018/19. Consumption is likely to exceed 19.4m tonnes in that season, although this relies on sunflowerseed oil maintaining its competitive position against other oils.
Sunflowerseed oil's improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
Given the increasing discounts to rapeseed and soybean oils, EU sunflowerseed oil consumption in the 2017/18 season is getting off to a good start. The increased estimate of local availability will also provide a further boost to consumption. We have raised our forecast of EU consumption to just over 4.6m tonnes. Consumption at this level can now be achieved without any increase in imports of sunflowerseed oil. Sunflowerseed enjoys a favourable consumer image, and with production set to increase again to 4.8m tonnes in 2018/19, we can reasonably expect further growth in consumption.
Russian consumption will rise modestly as the economy emerges from recession
In Russia, we expect local availability to tighten slightly in 2017/18, which may be reflected in local prices; however, we expect supply to remain comfortable enough to support continued demand growth. Nonetheless, we remain cautious about prospects, with our consumption forecast representing growth of only 1%. In 2018/19 consumption prospects are encouraged by a small increase in expected economic growth in 2019. Overall, we currently expect growth to accelerate to a more normal 3.8%.
Robust GDP growth and shifting preferences will boost India's usage
Indian imports of sunflowerseed are continuing to run at high levels despite the imposition of higher import tariffs. Internal Indian prices show sunflowerseed oil to be increasingly competitive with other oils. The growing consumer preference for sunflowerseed oil, especially in the south of India, and sustained economic growth should also be positive for demand growth. We think that 2017/18 consumption could exceed 2.3m tonnes, with further growth to more than 2.4m tonnes in 2018/19.
Consumption growth to moderate in "other" countries in 2017/18
Many countries have been increasing their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Supplies are likely to remain comfortable throughout the forecast period. Countries increasing their use of sunflowerseed oil include Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, as well as several smaller countries. We expect consumption growth in these "other" countries to moderate in 2017/18, to 2.2%, as the rapid growth seen in 2016/17 (13.9%) is unlikely to be replicated as sunflowerseed oil becomes less competitive with other products, including palm and soybean oils.

Supply
The outlook for the 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop is mixed. The most recent estimates indicate that output in Russia, Ukraine and Argentina will not meet earlier expectations. However, these reductions have been more than offset by a large rise in the estimate of EU sunflowerseed production and a smaller increase in estimated US production. Overall, the global harvest looks likely to be only marginally smaller than the large 2016/17 outturn. Early indications suggest another large crop in 2018/19, along with further growth in sunflowerseed oil production. In addition, the size of the crop would allow some rebuilding of stocks to more normal levels.
Ukraine's 2016/17 sunflowerseed harvest exceeds our expectations
The latest harvest estimates for Ukraine suggest that the sunflowerseed crop has failed to live up to early estimates for the 2017/18 season. This has prompted a further reduction in our harvest estimate to 13.2m tonnes (previously 13.7m tonnes). However, with relatively plentiful sunflowerseed stocks carried over, this is not likely to have an immediate impact on crush rates. Exports of sunflowerseed oil in the year to date from the Ukraine have been running above year-earlier levels. However, for the season as a whole, the smaller harvest will have an impact on crushing volumes. Although the 2018/19 outlook is still provisional, the industry's strong expansion in recent years should ensure ample seed availability despite concerns about crop rotations. We expect that normal yields would lead to a sunflowerseed harvest similar to the record output achieved in 2016/17. This would provide sufficient raw material for sunflowerseed oil output in 2018/19 to rise to nearly 6.2m tonnes, only slightly lower than the record outturn in 2016/17.
Sunflowerseed will remain a popular crop in Russia
There have been delays to the sunflowerseed harvest in Russia, leading to concerns that some fields may not be harvested. We have reduced our estimate of the final outturn to 11.4m tonnes, marginally below last season's record production. However, our current assessment puts sunflowerseed oil output at an unchanged 4.6m tonnes in 2017/18. We expect that the 2018/19 sunflowerseed area will be similar to 2017/18. Normal yields would give a record crop of more than 12m tonnes. Sunflowerseed oil production could reach almost 4.9m tonnes, provided that sufficient markets can be found.
Estimates for the EU sunflowerseed harvest in 2016/17 have improved
The production of sunflowerseed in the EU for the 2017/18 season has surpassed previous expectations. Yields have been especially high in France. Current assessments put the total crop at a new record high of 9.5m tonnes. The higher availability will lead to a reduction in sunflowerseed imports but should also result in higher EU crushing volumes. Consequently, our forecast of EU sunflowerseed oil production in 2017/18 has been raised again, to 3.4m tonnes (3.3m tonnes previously). Sunflowerseed sowings for 2018/19, which start in the spring, are expected to be marginally lower than in 2017/18. At this level, a potential crop of more than 9m tonnes is in prospect. Sunflowerseed oil production could approach 3.5m tonnes.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain good, but downside risks are mounting
In Argentina, around 90% of the intended area of sunflowerseed for 2017/18 is planted. Sowings got off to a good start, although wet conditions have hampered later plantings. The area looks set to be 9% higher than in 2016/17 and could lead to a crop of around 3.9m tonnes. We continue to expect that sunflowerseed oil production will exceed 1.4m tonnes in 2017/18 and reach 1.5m tonnes in 2018/19. Export availability of sunflowerseed in 2017/18 will also be higher than in 2016/17, even with the reduced crop estimate.

Stocks and prices
Stocks of sunflowerseed oil remain plentiful, and this situation is likely to persist for the 2017/18 season. Previous concerns over the level of sunflowerseed stocks have, to a degree, been allayed by the increases in harvest estimates. However, the 2017/18 sunflowerseed production total continues to rely on a drawdown of sunflowerseed stocks and may consequently turn out to be overoptimistic. Nonetheless, current projections suggest a recovery in sunflowerseed stocks in 2018/19, which may encourage crushers to maintain activity during the latter part of the 2017/18 season.

Upward pressure on prices will be felt in the coming months
Sunflowerseed oil prices showed a small increase in November, encouraged by higher rapeseed oil prices. Despite this, sunflowerseed oil continues to trade at historically substantial discounts to soybean and rapeseed oils, and at only a small premium to palm oil. The small market deficit expected in 2017/18 should be positive for future sunflowerseed oil prices, and we therefore we expect this upward trend to persist. Price rises are likely to be comparatively small, and by the end of the 2017/18 season prices will have remained below US$900/tonne. The 2018/19 season should see a continuation of price gains. Although current projections suggest an oil deficit, the increase in sunflowerseed stocks may dampen any increase in values. Nonetheless, the US$900/tonne level should be breached towards the end of the 2018/19 season.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for one-third of world tea consumption and is consuming ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is also growing in other major consuming regions, including India. Demand for tea is less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities owing to its low cost, implying that tea demand is mainly driven by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast for tea consumption growth, of 3.8% a year on average in 2018-19, is relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since tea consumption is determined by structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages. Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and "ready to drink" tea beverages account for a small share of the tea market but have enjoyed rapid growth in sales-even in traditional markets such as China.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are also the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption. In producing countries, tea will benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places will remain a consumer staple, despite increase in consumption of other beverages, including coffee. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partially to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2017-18
Tea consumption will remain dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2017, up from 48% in 2010. In China, we expect the government's efforts to rein in credit growth to contribute to an economic slowdown from 2018; nonetheless, this will have only a muted impact on tea demand growth, which is forecast to rise by 4% per year, compared with 5% in 2017. This forecast is relatively cautious, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projecting average annual Chinese demand growth of 15% until 2024, suggesting an upside risk to our forecasts. Average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China just 14th in the world. This leaves significant room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drink tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Other changes in consumer habits will also affect tea sales, with greater demand for teabags globally (these are less wasteful than loose-leaf tea). However, given the importance attached to the quality of tea, sales of leaf teas will continue to dominate the local market.
In India, strong economic growth will be accompanied by higher household spending, firm consumer confidence and supportive demographics, driving annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2018-19, marginally lower than estimated growth of 6.5% in 2017. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently, the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share, as well as fuelling overall tea consumption growth.
Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2018-19 by market saturation and weakening demographics. The FAO forecasts an overall contraction until 2024 in many EU markets (which together account for just under 5% of global consumption), despite a firmer economic performance, as well as in Russia (2.5% of global consumption). Turkey, which also accounts for around 5% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting continued population growth and steady growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. We forecast average annual growth in tea demand in 2018-19 of 1.9% in the EU and 0.4% in Turkey. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.5% per year, but is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consump-tion in 2013-16.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for less than 2.5% of global consumption, and consumption per head is low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea. We expect demand to increase by an annual average of 2.6% in 2018-19, partly reflecting our fairly upbeat forecast for economic growth. Health concerns will also sustain demand for tea, with a gradual shift away from carbonated beverages towards healthier alternatives.
New tea markets are emerging
Export data from tea-producing countries reveal that new markets for tea are emerging, with the number of countries buying tea at the major auction houses in Asia and Africa on the rise. Demand from these new joiners in the tea market, mainly fast-growing emerging countries, is set to increase in 2018-19, underpinning our forecast for average consumption growth of 2.5% a year across all "other" countries, which together account for 18% of global consumption.

Supply
After an estimated 1.7% contraction in global tea production in 2017-the first fall in output since our data series (which is based on historical data from the FAO) began in 2000-tea production is forecast to recover in 2018-19, rising by 3.5% and 2.1% respectively. However, these growth rates remain weak by historical comparison; annual growth in tea output averaged 4.4% during 2004-14. Along with weather concerns, several structural factors will prevent faster production growth. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades owing to the higher cost of inputs, resulting in a fall in investment. Notwithstanding a recent softening of the US dollar, many currencies will remain comparatively weak against the dollar in 2018-19, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers. Production would be affected if a La Niña weather phenomenon develops in the coming months: this often brings unusually cold temperatures to some Chinese tea-growing regions, drought to Kenya and very wet conditions to Vietnam. Depending on how weather conditions develop, this has the potential to lead to another year of declining tea production.
Much of the forecast increase in global tea production in 2018-19 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects the rise in tea production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, compared with 43% a decade ago. We expect these trends to continue during the 2018-19 forecast period.
As in 2016, adverse weather will harm Chinese tea production in 2017
China experienced the second consecutive year of disappointing tea production growth in 2017. We estimate that output expanded by 2.2%, after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, in June. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which will also have hampered production.
Even on the assumption that weather conditions will improve in 2018-19, production growth is forecast to slow further, to an annual average of 2%. Under-lying economic growth will slow gradually during 2018 as the govern-ment takes action to bring debt levels under control, and is not projected to accelerate significantly in 2019. We expect government efforts to modernise the agri-cultural sector through large-scale lending from the state-owned Agricultural Development Bank of China to progress slowly, with some Chinese tea investors instead seeking to expand production overseas rather than in China. These factors will combine to undermine growth in tea output.
Beyond the forecast period there is scope for return to firmer rates of tea production growth. The authorities are engaged in efforts to lift product quality and quantity in order to boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Given that China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 785 kg in 2012-14, compared with 2,085 kg in India and 2,105 kg in Kenya), there is certainly potential for gains in productivity.
India's tea production will continue to grow in 2018 and 2019
We estimate tea production growth of 3.3% in India in 2017. Output fell in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state), as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India, but weather conditions improved subsequently. Assuming supportive weather conditions in 2018-19, we expect tea production to continue to rise, albeit more gradually. Continued efforts to channel funding to tea growers will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly and rising input costs have eroded profits, implying that in the long term India may struggle to increase growth as significantly as other major producers. We forecast average growth in tea production of 2% per year in 2018-19.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
We estimate a double-digit decline in tea output in Sri Lanka in 2017, reflecting recent torrential rain that caused landslides and the worst flooding in over a decade. Many of the 400,000 farmers, who account for 70% of national tea output, saw their bushes submerged by muddy water. Sri Lanka's tea production is forecast to rise in 2018, by 5.8%, but this will largely reflect a cyclical recovery after several disappointing years. As in India, there are several structural hurdles that will hamper growth, assuming that weather conditions improve. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not sufficiently high to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. Local reports also show that fertiliser use has been low, and the risk of industrial unrest persists. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. These factors explain why our production growth forecast in 2019, of 1.8%, is relatively weak.
Moreover, the main customers for Sri Lankan tea-Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria-have all experienced economic turbulence in recent years. Economic conditions are expected to improve markedly in Iran with the lifting of sanctions, and to a lesser degree in Russia and Turkey, but this is unlikely to be enough to boost demand for Sri Lankan tea significantly. Most of the country's tea is loose leaf, rather than mass-produced tea bags, which limits the extent to which the country can diversify its tea exports towards Europe and the US. The Ministry of Plantation Industries has stated that it is considering a proposal to allow tea imports for blending in an attempt to boost export potential, and the Tea Board is continuing to urge the government to take measures to make the tea industry more competitive, but it is unclear if there is sufficient support domestically to push the measures through, as there is a strong perception among farmers that this would undermine local production.

A partial recovery in output is likely in Kenya in 2018-19
After a massive jump in tea production in Kenya in 2016, with output hitting an all-time high of 473,000 tonnes, weather conditions deteriorated sharply in 2017, with a renewed and persistent dry spell damaging tea plantations. Kenya's agriculture minister has stated that tea output is likely to fall by 12%, but our estimate envisages a much sharper drop, of 30%, given that production was down by about one-third in the first eight months of the year. Although tea production is forecast to stage a partial recovery in 2018-19, rising by 24.2% and 4.9% respectively, output levels even in 2019 will remain relatively weak. Periodic industrial action in the sector over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers, so that it is based on the value rather than the volume of sales, will also undermine profitability in the medium term. Although the government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, conflicting interests and a lack of funds will hinder progress.
Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes three to five years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact on output of recent price falls will be evident only after the forecast period.
Stocks and prices
We estimate a fourth consecutive year of market deficits in 2017, reflecting increasing consumption and a contraction in output from several of the main tea-producing countries. We expect consumption growth to outstrip production growth during 2018-19, meaning that we forecast deepening market deficits in those years.
Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge how significantly these widening market deficits will affect stock levels. The fact that prices fell during 2015-16 despite market deficits in both years indicates that stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output in China, which mainly consists of green tea. Although some of the production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.

Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya respectively (essentially, black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. As an example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have risen sharply in 2017 (with the former hitting record levels of US$4/kg as production has slumped), while prices at the Kolkata auction have remained similar to their year-earlier levels for much of the year. Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes (there is no futures market). Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat slightly in 2018-19
We estimate a full-year average price of US$3.11/kg in 2017, an 18.1% year-on-year increase, reflecting the weak outlook for production and continued firm consumption growth. Although the market deficit will remain large in 2018-19, recovering production is expected to reduce prices by 3.6%, to an average of US$3/kg in 2018, and by a further 6.3% in 2019, to US$2.81/kg.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has nearly tripled since the 1960s, to more than 700m tonnes in recent years. Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been tied to a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has persistently outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and for the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global consumption to rise marginally, by 0.7%, to nearly 740m tonnes in 2017/18. Although wheat use for food is expected to increase, in line with the recent trend, it appears likely that world feed consumption will decline, owing partly to competition from alternative products. A similar pattern is expected in 2018/19. Although use for feed is expected to slip back further, a rise for milling and food use should see total demand increase by 0.3%, to 742m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in global food-wheat consumption has remained relatively consistent over the past decade, with increases averaging 1.4% a year. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods such as noodles, as well as Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports in most years. We expect world food use to rise by 1.5% in 2017/18, exceeding 500m tonnes for the first time. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa. These trends are well established and are expected to continue into 2018/19, when food consumption could rise to 511m tonnes.
World feed use is forecast at a higher than usual level in 2016/17
Wheat is the world's second most important grain for use in animal feed, although it is typically equivalent to one-quarter of feed-use of maize, with annual wheat use roughly matching that of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. Assuming strong competition from maize-especially in the EU, China, and the US-we expect use for livestock feed to fall back by 3.7% year on year in 2017/18, to around 144m tonnes. The figure for Canada is also forecast to be sharply lower than last year, dropping by about half, to 3m tonnes, on much smaller feed grade supplies. At the moment, we forecast a modest decline in global demand for feed-grade wheat in 2018/19, to around 144m tonnes. The drop stems mainly from a projected small decline in Russia, where a smaller crop is likely to limit discretionary on-farm feeding.
Consumption is rising quickly in Sub-Saharan Africa
Wheat demand in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased relatively quickly in recent years, mainly due to rapid population growth. Wheat-based foods have gained in popularity over traditional staples such as maize porridges, cassava and millet. Higher incomes, migration to cities and more women participating in the workforce have all contributed to greater demand for convenience-and often wheat-based-foods. With climatic conditions in most countries unsuitable for producing wheat except for in a few select countries, including Ethiopia and South Africa, demand is mainly being met by imports, which are now well in excess of 20m tonnes per year. Regional consumption is estimated at around 29m tonnes in 2017/18, up by around 500,000 tonnes from 2016/17. Almost all wheat is consumed for food purposes, with less than 2% of total demand channeled into feed sectors. South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya are the five-largest consumers of wheat in the region, accounting for around 65% of overall consumption. Of these countries, Nigeria is by far the least self-sufficient, importing virtually all of its domestic needs, forecast to be around 4.7m tonnes in 2017/18. Wheat demand in Africa will eventually begin to slow in response to an anticipated moderation in population growth and the inclusion of more animal protein in diets, but such changes are unlikely in the next few years.
Mexico is eyeing wheat imports from Argentina
Mexico's phytosanitary authority recently finalised a long-awaited protocol al-lowing for the import of wheat from Argentina. A group of millers have already contracted a trial shipment, which will first be assessed for quality before further purchases are considered. Although there is talk that the move is in some way linked to the ongoing North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations, private importers have indicated that the deal instead reflects very competitive pricing in Argentina. Indeed, local users have proven quite willing to switch origins in recent years, sourcing a number of cargoes from the Black Sea and occasionally the EU. Mexico typically imports around two-thirds of its annual needs, with domestic consumption increasing steadily in recent decades, forecast at around 7.8m tonnes in 2017/18. Although a series of anti-obesity campaigns have curbed demand for cakes, pastries and cookies in the past few years, production of other, plainer bread products remains strong, and population growth continues to drive demand.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, these gains have mainly stemmed from the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia, but China, India and parts of Latin America have also contributed bigger crops. The harvested area has increased across many parts of the globe, and average yields have also risen, despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat seed technology. However, given recent spells of poor weather across wheat belts in both hemispheres, the recent growth trend is expected to come to a halt. In 2017/18 we forecast global wheat production to decline by 0.6% year on year, to 750m tonnes, owing largely to lower output from the US, Canada and Australia. Russia's massive 2017/18 crop has diverted some attention away from the fact that supplies of the best quality, high-protein wheats from North America and parts of Europe will be below average levels and will therefore command a price premium. With prices at relatively low levels, there is unlikely to be much incentive for farmers to increase 2018/19 plantings. Crop rotation needs will again be important, but in countries where there are few alternatives, seeded area is unlikely to show much year-on-year change. Assuming average yields, the world crop is forecast to contract by 1% in 2018/19, to 742m tonnes.
After a small EU crop last year, output should rise in 2017/18
Despite a mixed year for the main EU wheat growers, the 2017/18 crop is expected to be slightly larger than average, at 151.5m tonnes. Yields have rebounded strongly for wheat growers in France-which accounts for around one-quarter of the bloc's total output-following the previous season's sub-par results. Survey results also confirm its good quality, with a much higher percentage than last year meeting milling specifications. In contrast, a wet finish to the German harvest has led to a series of quality downgrades in key northern export-producing areas. Spain's wheat crop was also negatively affected by a punishing drought, which lasted for virtually the entire year. Producers are now wrapping up 2018/19 winter wheat planting. Low prices, forecast to be below production costs in some countries, are expected to be a general disincentive. However, with earlier wet conditions preventing some producers from switching wheat area to rapeseed as intended, there is unlikely to be much overall change in plantings for next year's harvest. Assuming normal yields, output is likely to be in line with the average, at 148m tonnes.
An enormous crop in Russia
Average 2017/18 yields in Russia were easily the best ever, with production rising by 14.5%, to a record 83m tonnes. The forecast is raised by 1m tonnes from November and could be raised again in the coming months, once final clean-weight harvest data is finalised. Winter and spring wheat crops enjoyed near-perfect growing conditions, benefitting from timely and abundant rains. Attention is now beginning to switch to 2018/19 prospects. Recent dry weather in southern areas has not been ideal for early crop establishment but has allowed for a quick start to planting, with winter sowings slightly exceeding the official target by late November. Assuming that yields are similar to the recent trend, but down from the record-breaking results achieved this year, we expect 2018/19 output to decline by around 13.3%, to 72m tonnes, which is still an impressive outturn.
US wheat production fell sharply in 2017/18
US all-wheat production in 2017/18 totals 47.4m tonnes, down by 25% year on year, and at a 15-season low. The sharp drop in output mainly reflects a pullback in plantings, with the smallest harvested area in almost 130 years. The winter wheat outturn was 34.5m tonnes (down by 24% year on year), with durum at 1.5m tonnes (down by 47%) and other spring varieties at 10.7m tonnes (down by 27%). Sowing of next season's winter wheat crop was finished slightly later than average. Reflecting a dry start to the season in some states, only half the crop was estimated to be in good or excellent condition-eight percentage points lower than at the same point a year ago. Depressed prices and limited potential for profits mean that another drop in winter and spring plantings is now likely. Assuming reduced abandonment and better overall yields, mainly for spring-sown wheat, 2018/19 production is forecast to rise by 4.9%, to 49.7m tonnes, about 11% below the previous five-year average.
China's wheat support policies are starting to change
Latest official data from China confirmed a small rise in 2017/18 wheat production, as an improvement in yields more than compensated for a minor reduction in harvested area. High- and low-gluten wheat varieties, needed to produce Western style breads and cakes, accounted for almost 28% of this year's crop, up by nearly 3 percentage points from 2016/17. After focusing first on efforts to realign cotton, maize, rapeseed and soybean markets with international prices, authorities are now beginning to tweak foodgrain price support policies too. Following changes to rice subsidy programmes last year, the government recently announced a 2.5% reduction in the 2018/19 minimum state purchase price for wheat, the first such cut since the initiative was introduced 11 years ago. Although unusual, next year's minimum price of Rmb2,300/tonne (US$348/tonne) is still about double the current price of US winter wheat and around US$100/tonne above milling wheat import prices, including freight costs. However, it must be stressed that imports are, in effect, limited by the country's tariff rate quota (TRQ), under which the private sector is only eligible to buy slightly less than 1m tonnes at the reduced 1% import duty. The policy announcement was not a big surprise and had been well-flagged by party officials in recent months.
With winter wheat planting for next year's crop already mostly finished, the policy shift is unlikely to have much of an impact for 2018/19. Sowings are expected to stay relatively high, with production tentatively placed at 129m tonnes. The announcement could, however, mark the start of some wider-ranging reforms in the years ahead as the government looks to unwind its excessively large wheat stocks, which have been built up in recent years. Should the lower support price feed through into lower market values for common wheat, a wider price differential could encourage farmers to further expand production of the higher-quality wheats in the years ahead. This could have some implications for imports, which have ranged from 1.9m tonnes to 6.8m tonnes during the past five years, and are mostly used to plug shortfalls in local high-quality wheat supplies.
Some early challenges for wheat farmers in India
India's government recently raised the minimum support price (MSP) for the 2018/19 wheat crop by around 7%, a slightly sharper rise than in previous years. As part of wider efforts to support farmers and curb cheap imports (mainly from the Black Sea region), authorities confirmed that the wheat import duty would be doubled to 20%. Both initiatives are expected to support planting decisions in the months ahead, potentially keeping the planted area close to the 2017/18 record high. However, lower than normal irrigation water supplies could affect rabi (winter) crop choices in some state. Because of a mixture of cold and occasionally dry weather, seeding has progressed quite slowly so far, with sowings to date around two-thirds behind average as at November 24th. With a long way still to go before the planting window closes, we retain our forecasts for now, with next year's crop still pegged at 97.5m tonnes-down by 1% year on year, but nearly 7% above the previous five-year average.
Wheat is back in favour with Argentinian farmers
In Argentina, policy changes made under the government that came to power in late 2015, including exchange-rate liberalisation and the removal of export quotas and taxes, have greatly incentivised the country's wheat farmers. Sown area for 2017/18 is officially estimated to be down by 7% year on year, with earlier flooding preventing access to low-lying fields across southern parts of Buenos Aires and La Pampa provinces. Despite the drop, acreage is still over 20% higher than the five-year average. By late November the harvest was around one-fifth complete, with progress most advanced in the northern provinces, where results to date have shown confirmed disappointing yields but good quality. For now, production is forecast to decline by 8% year on year, to 16m tonnes.

Stocks and prices
Cumulative world stocks are forecast to rise for the fifth consecutive season in 2017/18 to 251m tonnes, up by 4% year on year to an all-time high. However, this large total figure masks some important features, as gains in world inventories are mostly attributed to rises in end-season stocks in India and China, whose stocks are not available on the world market. Indeed, with China's stocks having doubled over a five-year period, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to use carryovers in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supplies. Cumulative stockpiles in those countries are forecast to drop by around 7% year on year, to 70.7 m tonnes, but will still be up by 11% from the average in recent years. The projection for 2018/19 is provisional, but suggests a continuation of the most recent trend. World stocks are likely to remain high, probably on a par with 2016/17 levels. Exporter stocks of 62.7m tonnes, although not considered especially tight, would be the smallest in five years.
Russia's wheat stocks have almost tripled in just three years
Although Russia's exports have been running at a record pace in recent months, infrastructure capacity constraints mean that July-June shipments could be limited to around 33m tonnes, nowhere near enough to prevent a further build-up in 2017/18 stocks. Works to upgrade existing terminals are ongoing, and although new port facilities are also being planned for construction, including in eastern parts of the country, close to China, these projects are expected to take three or more years to complete. Therefore, following two successive massive crops, wheat stocks are expected to reach a record high at the end of 2017/18, potentially reaching 16.8m tonnes, up from just 5.6m tonnes two seasons ago. According to the Russian Grain Union, a non-governmental farmers' association, the country currently has 120m tonnes of grain-storage capacity, around two-thirds of which consists of mostly on-farm barns and warehouses, which are susceptible to greater post-harvest losses. Most of the country's storage facilities are in need of upgrading, with the best facilities mainly located close to the key southern producing and exporting areas. High stock levels are expected to keep a lid on prices heading into the next season and, even if 2018/19 production falls short of recent levels, the additional supplies should provide a cushion, allowing Russia to maintain its dominant position on the world export market.

Wheat prices are likely to remain weak in the short term
Trading in world wheat markets has fluctuated in recent months. Steep early-summer gains, linked primarily to a drought in parts of the US and Canada, were later erased on the back of better than expected results from harvests in the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia. Amid overall heavy world availabilities and strong competition for available export business, wheat prices at most major origins dipped again in November, edging down by 1% on average. Declines in the US were tied partly to sluggish overseas demand and a bearishly interpreted USDA supply-and-demand report. While buoyant export demand and logistical bottlenecks shored up Black Sea export quotations earlier in the month, particularly in Russia, regional traders were keen to maintain market share and prices began to weaken again in recent weeks. With Russian shipments expected to remain high throughout the season, strong export competition is likely to keep a lid on prices, at least for next year. Assuming that crop prospects do not deteriorate further, we expect Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat export prices (12% protein, fob Gulf) to fall steadily until mid-2018, before strengthening slightly thereafter. However, higher protein supplies are expected to command a hefty price premium, at least until the 2018/19 northern hemisphere crops enter the pipeline.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power in the wake of the installation of a Constituent Assembly in 2017, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power beyond 2019 if the government finds financing to avoid a disorderedly default or if it manages to boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 3,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract into 2019. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2020-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, GDP contraction and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making the country one of the least attractive investment locations in the world. This reflects state intervention-ism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme (although this is winding down), the country is running short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$11bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages, narrowing the current-account deficit to 0.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Even as Venezuela's severe economic woes deepen amid an intensifying debt crisis and hyperinflation, the governing Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has strengthened its hold on power as the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has slid into disarray. Elections are theoretically due in December 2018, but the electoral schedule remains uncertain. Regardless, and despite the unpopularity of the president, Nicolás Maduro, the govern-ment's history of electoral manipulation means that it is unlikely that the PSUV would leave power via elections. Instead, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition process, most likely ushering the MUD into power in 2019.
The PSUV's concerted efforts at undermining the MUD explain the latter's inability to effect change. Government tactics have included banning candidacies, jailing popular politicians and stripping all power from the MUD-controlled National Assembly, which in August was superseded by a new Constituent Assembly (ANC). The PSUV-only ANC is formally concerned with rewriting the constitution, but has also taken over all legislative powers during its two-year remit. In addition, the PSUV has fostered divisions within the MUD, rewarding co-operation from some factions while penalising others. This has often created divergent interests within the MUD, leading to a divided front.
The PSUV's future currently depends on the support of three key backers: the state's coercive apparatus (the security forces and military); a sizeable sector of the population dependent on government handouts; and activist groups (so-called colectivos) whose actions place them somewhere between community organisers and PSUV paramilitaries. The key backer in the arrangement is the military. Gendarmerie and armed forces generals control nine of 14 ministries related to infrastructure and the management of the economy. Since November a gendarmerie general, Manuel Quevedo, has served as oil minister and head of PDVSA, the state owned oil company. To maintain the support of its backers, the government plies these groups with resources, with the vast majority coming from PDVSA. We believe that a prolonged interruption in exports by PDVSA would make continuation of such benefits difficult, while at the same time worsening an already calamitous economic situation.
There are two main paths towards a destabilising interruption in PDVSA exports. The most immediate possible path is a disorderly default of sovereign and/or PDVSA external debt. Legal action in the US (as permitted by bond contracts) could result in seizures of PDVSA's assets (such as those of Citgo, a PDVSA-owned, US-based refinery). Such actions, if widespread, could curtail exports dramatically, despite the possibility that PDVSA would take defensive measures to limit the effectiveness of seizures. The second path, which works independently of legal action, relates to PDVSA's falling output. Output has fallen by 20% since Mr Maduro took office, and we expect production to continue dropping into 2018, dragging with it PDVSA's US dollar earnings. However, there is a risk that the Maduro administration could avoid this fate if sufficient Chinese, Indian or Russian investment in the sector supports output.
Although we expect further concessions to the military in 2018, we foresee an ongoing decline in hard-currency earnings, putting the government's patronage system at risk by late 2018 or early 2019. In the context of political polarisation, it would be difficult for the PSUV to appease critics by replacing Mr Maduro with another high-ranking PSUV figure, although such attempts might be made in the first instance. It also seems unlikely that the PSUV would allow free and fair elections. Instead, the most likely progression of events would involve the military pushing the PSUV out and restoring order while paving the way for elections. Under this baseline scenario, an elected MUD government would take office in 2019. However, there is a risk that free and fair elections would be significantly delayed.
Regardless of how and when political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. In addition to having to contend with holdovers in the colectivos and in the military, the MUD will have to confront huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The opposition boycotted the nationwide municipal elections held on December 10th 2017, which led to a PSUV sweep. Theoretically, a presidential election is due in December 2018. However, given the PSUV's history of electoral manipulation, postponement or an early election are both possibilities. The latter is more likely, as it would allow the regime to take advantage of the opposition's disarray and pre-empt the effects of a worsening economic situation. Regardless, any presidential election under the PSUV is unlikely to be free and fair. We do expect relatively free and fair elections following the PSUV's exit from power.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Venezuela has come under increasing regional and international pressure. The EU has denounced the regime's anti-democratic practices and banned weapons sales to Venezuela. Similar steps have been taken by Mercosur (a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and the so called Lima Group, a group of 12 Latin American nations.
Relations with the US have also deteriorated. Both individual sanctions (the last coming on January 5th) and sanctions prohibiting transactions of new Venezuelan debt by US persons have made it nearly impossible for PDVSA or the government to renegotiate its debts. Given Venezuela's extreme dependency on trade with the US (Venezuela exports oil to and imports distillates from the US), the oft-rumoured embargo would have a destabilising effect on the government's patronage system, likely triggering our regime change baseline forecast. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia, which continues to provide limited financial backing. China, a previous major source of financing, has seemingly with-drawn, as there is no public evidence of new Chinese financing since 2015.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government's immediate economic policy concern will be fending off debt default and associated legal challenges. The government has gone into arrears on some sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including PDVSA), while also making late payments on others. Despite announcing its intention to restructure debt, the government has also restated its commitment to pay while blaming payments delays on US sanctions and the payment system. The situation has been classified as technical default. A successful restructuring by the Maduro regime appears impossible. This is owing to logistical challenges imposed by US sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks an economic programme agreeable to creditors.
There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer late payment to lengthy legal battles. Eventually, this stance is likely to change. To avoid PDVSA asset seizures, the government may choose to default on sovereign bonds but adhere to PDVSA's repayment schedule. Sovereign creditors would undoubtedly ask US courts to define PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government in order to seize its assets. However, such claims will take time. In this environment, the timing of likely seizures is unclear. When they do happen, the consequences for import capacity will be devastating. We assume that they would trigger a transition of power and, eventually, a change of economic policy direction.
In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2018 than it has done so far. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be introduced. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find.
Under our baseline scenario we expect the opposition to come to power in 2019, ushering in adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity. We have factored in a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process, forecasting lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of investors in the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public-sector accounts since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a non-financial public-sector deficit of 19.4% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.7% of GDP by 2022. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Under our baseline forecast of severe economic stress that would see an MUD-led opposition government in 2019, we expect a restructuring process with external creditors to happen.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits; money supply (M2) rose by 874% year on year in November, and preliminary data for December indicates further acceleration in that month. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government, which implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy, will see real interest rates turn positive.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-19, following an estimated contraction of 14% in 2017. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-22 rests on an assumption of slightly higher oil prices (in 2021-22), alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of over 40% in 2014-19.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink throughout 2018 as oil production falls further (we expect output to average below 1.9m barrels/day (b/d) in 2018, compared with an estimated 2m b/d in 2017), but will pick up thereafter, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise sharply, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have caused elevated inflation for the past two years. The government continues to decree maximum prices as its main policy tool to fight inflation, with the latest attempt coming in mid-November. We do not expect a policy reversal under the PSUV government, meaning that inflation will remain extremely high in the short term. Official data has not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that prices rose by 1,369% in January-November, following monthly inflation of 56.7% in November. We expect inflation to average over 3,000% in 2018. Shortages of basic goods will continue, as the lack of foreign currency limits imports. We continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, under the assumption of a recovery in oil output and corrective economic policies under an MUD-led government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Currently, a dual exchange-rate system is in operation, comprising an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed auction-based rate known as the Dicom, used for private-sector operations (but where demand for US dollars vastly outstrips supply). Public Dicom auctions were suspended in August, with Mr Maduro announcing the future usage of a "basket of currencies" (such as the rupee, rouble, yuan and euro) to replace the use of the dollar. However, the system is yet to be implemented, as the government seems to be hoarding all foreign exchange available to meet its debt obligations. Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2018, but the exchange rate will remain extremely overvalued. The suspension of the Dicom, coupled with runaway growth in the money supply, has led to a spike in the black-market foreign-exchange rate, which exceeded BsF130,000:US$1 by early January.
We assume that major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 would involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We forecast a current-account deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2018, as exports, held back by decaying infrastructure, falling oil production and lack of exploration, will be unable to offset imports, despite the government's best efforts at dampening them (we estimate that the value of imports in 2017 will be equivalent to one-fifth of those of 2012). After 2019, with a new administration in place, exports and imports will begin a recovery. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests a recovery in investment inflows, particularly into the oil sector. In addition, financial inflows in the wake of debt re-structuring, and financial and technical assistance from the IMF, should help to rebuild reserves coverage. This will buttress the stability of the external accounts and facilitate the gradual removal of foreign-exchange controls, as reflected by a convergence of the official and parallel exchange rates.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Despite a narrow victory and allegations of vote fraud in the presidential reform referendum on April 16th 2017, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is moving ahead with his plan to install a presidential system of government after elections due in 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will win the elections. The presidential system will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
Since the failed coup foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. Despite tax increases in 2018, we expect annual deficits to widen moderately, to 2.4% of GDP on average in 2018-19. After the elections we forecast that the deficit will shrink gradually, to 1.6% of GDP in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
We expect real GDP growth to slow from an estimated 7% in 2017 (revised up from 5.5%), to a still robust 4.1% per year on average in the forecast period (2018-22), reflecting the withdrawal of stimulus measures and higher taxes. Our growth forecast assumes that domestic political conditions will stabilise and foreign investor confidence in Turkey will hold up, maintaining foreign capital inflows.
After a fall in the nominal value of the Turkish lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. Constrained in its ability to raise interest rates, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to currency weakness and high inflation.
We expect the current-account deficit to narrow moderately, from an estimated 5% of GDP in 2017 to an annual average of 4.5% of GDP in 2018 22. This is still sufficiently large to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is severely constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but the country's global ranking falls by ten places, to 55th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: The cstoms union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, have been announced for 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious, but political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates continues. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Third Istanbul airport becomes operational. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely following the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Among the most important political events in the 2018-22 forecast period will be the three crucial votes in 2019: municipal elections, due to be held in March; and parliamentary and presidential elections, due in November. After these votes an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parliamentary system. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving the country into a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
Although the intense political instability that followed the failed coup has eased partially, we expect social and political tensions to intensify during the period up to the elections in 2019, and possibly beyond. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, has further polarised the country. It has also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and his party are losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place until after the elections, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk of terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS), and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but Turkey remains vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the PKK and IS. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
We expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the municipal, presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and he has the support of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process. However, there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, and that victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election is far from assured, especially if Abdullah Gul, a former president and co-founder of the AKP, decides to run. The challenge of Mr Gul, combined with that of the charismatic Meral Aksener, who recently formed the Good Party (IP), a breakaway group from the MHP, and the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, could prevent Mr Erdogan from reaching the 50% threshold for victory in the first round. This would transform the second-round run-off between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes into a deeply polarising referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation. This would boost the AKP's seat share, even if we expect that in exchange for the MHP's support for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election there will be an electoral alliance between the AKP and MHP to ensure that the MHP retains its representation in parliament. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a considerable risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding their concerns that under Mr Erdogan the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of Syrian Kurdish groups, which Turkey regards as terrorist organisations affiliated to the PKK; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of Turkey's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably to become president with executive powers after elections in 2019.
We expect Turkey and its Western allies to seek to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over alleged violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces, or it withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out completely. Regardless, Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic.
The spillover of violence from the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq will continue to pose serious domestic and external security threats to Turkey. In addition to terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey by IS and the PKK, which has camps in the mountains in northern Iraq, Turkey now has military forces de-ployed in two areas in Syria, ostensibly as part of the fight against IS and other jihadi groups, but also to prevent US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds from establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue influencing the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. Under political pressure not to raise interest rates further, especially ahead of the 2019 elections, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. In the event of another severe weakening of the lira, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary. However, this is not our baseline scenario.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy at the same time as encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and to prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to have expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 1.9% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, we expect increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects and public employment ahead of elections next year to cause the deficit to widen further, to an average of 2.4% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing to 1.6% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to remain stable at about 29.2% in 2017-19, before declining gradually to about 28% in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). However, because of political pressure not to raise interest rates further, we expect the central bank to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to the challenge, which will periodically test investor confidence in the bank's policy mix of moderate rate rises and macroprudential measures. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, but since November 2017 it has focused on using its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate to fund the banking system. This rate was gradually raised by a total of 275 basis points in 2017, to 12.75% in mid-December, pushing the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system to 12.75%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth is estimated to have accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7% in 2017 (revised up from 5.5% following the release of stronger than expected third-quarter national accounts in December). The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of 4.1% in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, the withdrawal of government stimulus measures introduced to support the economy after the coup attempt in July 2016 and a gradual tightening of global liquidity. There are downside risks to our forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government will not lead to further political instability that could deter foreign capital inflows.
We forecast that household consumption growth will moderate from an estimated 5.5% in 2017 to a still solid 3.2% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and the withdrawal of government incentives to support household spending. We also expect government consumption growth be strong, at an annual average rate of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing after the elections to a more moderate but still robust 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure, generating real growth of 6.7% per year in 2017-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, especially in the tourism sector; the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness; and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect growth to slow from an estimated 11.5% in 2017 to an annual average rate of 4.7% in 2018-22, reflecting base effects and our view that 2017 probably represented the recent peak in global economic growth. We continue to expect a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 to dampen external demand growth in that year.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
After a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow during the forecast period, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms. There are substantial risks to this forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region. We expect the lira to average TL4.345:US1 in 2022, compared with TL3.648:US$1 in 2017.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Although we expect the current-account deficit to narrow moderately from an estimated 5% of GDP to an annual average of 4.5% of GDP in 2018-22, Turkey's external financing needs will still be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. The rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Abstract: [...]the country drops one place in the regional ranking, to 11th and two places in the global ranking, to 18th. [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. In order to assuage worries from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which will be headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to 3.1% this year-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election was held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP's new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, propelled his party into first place. In mid-December he managed to form a coalition together with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to sanctions from other EU member states as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just below 70% by 2022, from an estimated 79.6% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.4% in that year. We estimate an acceleration of growth this year, to 3.1%, and forecast that growth will moderate to 1.8% on average in 2018-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015,-16 and was above 2% throughout the first ten months of 2017. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2.1% in 2017-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain relatively stable in the forecast period, at 1.9% of GDP on average in 2017-22.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). As a result, the country drops one place in the regional ranking, to 11th and two places in the global ranking, to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. No progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and reformed the party around himself. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
The ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition in mid-December after just over a month and a half of negotiations. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved close to the FPÖ in many policy areas (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly criticised Mr Kurz for stealing the FPÖ's programme) and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. In order to assuage worries from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which will be headed by an FPÖ appointee.
Although the chancellor is from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters and the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. Although the initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, once the focus shifts to international and EU issues, tensions between the ÖVP and the FPÖ are likely to increase and the risk of an early election is high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit until the end of the term of the new Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) in late 2022.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which could exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The new government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the EU in the coming years, especially on reform of migration. We expect it to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated this time. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority govern-ments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries, Italy and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy in recent years has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the previous coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. The new govern-ment will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and plans to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly. Whereas the parties mentioned plans to reform the country's corporatist system, the coalition agree-ment suggests only limited change in this regard.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 2% in 2013, and public debt rose to 83.7% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.6% in 2017 to just below 70% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that will run at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The economic recovery in the euro zone has strengthened this year and has become more broad based. We expect another healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2018, of 2.1%, after estimated growth of 2.4% in 2017. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, but maintains a clearly dovish policy stance, with the reduction in the amount of monthly QE purchases in 2018 designed to extend its presence in the bond markets. The bank also plans to delay raising interest rates and will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities for a period well beyond the end of the QE programme. We expect the pace of monthly QE purchases to be reduced to zero in early 2019, but owing to subdued price pressure and persistent downside risks to growth, we forecast that the bank will delay raising policy rates until 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP growth was sluggish even by euro zone standards in 2012-16.
However, the economy recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.9% between July 2016 and September 2017. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, in part owing to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.5% this year. Furthermore, export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to 3.1% this year-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.4%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have been a one-off. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy-price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation from October 2016 into 2017, when we estimate full-year average inflation of 2.2%. Recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect it to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2.1% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. We expect the euro to appreciate further in 2022 as the monetary policy tightening cycle begins.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-16, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect the trade balance to move back into a modest deficit from 2017 as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, we expect the services balance largely to offset the weakening trade balance and the current-account surplus to remain broadly flat throughout 2017-22, at about 2% of GDP on average.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars and the legacy of the cold war, during which Europe was divided into two blocs. The ending of Soviet control over central and eastern Europe from 1989, followed by the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than that of other east European countries. The effects of war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-east Europe.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and healthy levels of political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-in particular those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at the EU level. Nineteen EU member states share the euro as their currency. These countries are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank (ECB). They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have often been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. Although the euro zone crisis has passed its peak, normalisation remains a long way off. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during its medium-term forecast period (2018-22). Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster and more successfully with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with mainstream parties will persist in 2018 and Europe will remain subject to heightened geopolitical risk.
The failure to form a new government coalition in Germany after the September 2017 federal election has led to difficult and potentially protracted negotiations between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the risk of another election.
Political uncertainty in Germany, an election in Italy, the Catalonia crisis, the Brexit process, Russia-EU tensions and vulnerability to political instability in parts of the CIS and the Balkans will test Europe in 2018.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU to result in a deal in March 2019 on a transitional period lasting up to two years, but the risk that negotiations will break down is significant.
We expect Vladimir Putin to win the presidential election in Russia in 2018. We expect EU sanctions on Russia to be maintained over the medium term and for relations to remain difficult, competitive and conflict-prone.
Economic policy
In late 2017 the Bank of England reversed its post-referendum interest-rate cut of 0.25%. It is likely to keep policy accommodative given Brexit uncertainty, but we now expect it to normalise policy in mid-2019 rather than early 2020.
We expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to increase policy rates in 2022, continuing the very loose monetary stance of recent years. The ECB will reduce net asset purchases to EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018.
There may be attempts to rebalance the monetary and fiscal policy mix in the euro zone, but the bloc's fiscal rules could make this a contentious process.
Economic reform has progressed well in some countries, including Spain and Ireland, but for most the main challenges lie ahead. With political fragmentation on the rise, policymaking is becoming more difficult.
Economic growth
We forecast average real GDP growth in the EU28 at an average of 1.8% in 2018-22, following estimated growth of 2.4% in 2017.
We expect a real GDP growth slowdown in the UK in 2018-19, to 1.5% per year, because of Brexit uncertainty, and an acceleration in 2019-22.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook : Political stability
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a serious challenge to the future cohesion of the bloc. Despite the professed unity of the other 27 member states, the departure of one of the biggest members is a profound shock that is likely to reverberate. The EU's management of the Brexit crisis has been further complicated by an outbreak of political instability in Germany, where the outcome of the September 2017 federal election dealt a blow to the two leading parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The failure to form a so-called Jamaica coalition-comprising the CDU; its partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU); the Free Democratic Party (FDP); and The Greens-was a further blow to the authority of the chancellor. The prospect of difficult negotiations between the CDU/CSU and the SPD dragging on into early 2018 has created more political uncertainty at a testing time for the EU. The Catalonia crisis, which burst into focus in October after pro-independence citizens voting in an illegal referendum encountered state violence, poses another threat to the cohesion of the EU. Nor is the populist challenge to established parties across the bloc likely to dissipate, and a general election in Italy in 2018 is likely to result in a victory for the insurgent Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), although because of the new electoral system the party is unlikely to obtain a parliamentary majority, and is unlikely to be willing to join a coalition with mainstream parties.
The lesson of the past eight years, since the onset of the euro zone crisis in late 2009, is that politicians have underestimated the economic and political challenges facing the bloc and have prematurely claimed that the worst is over. Threats to the future of the EU, including the sovereign debt crisis, the migration crisis and the populist insurgency, have not been resolved. The existential threat to the euro has certainly lessened since the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-13, when the danger of one of the peripheral economies being forced out of the euro zone, through a loss of investor confidence and a spike in bond yields, weighed heavily on sentiment and investment. The commitment of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the euro has largely neutralised speculative pressure in the bond markets, but the single currency is still vulnerable, with Greece and Italy being the most obvious causes for concern. Another migration crisis could unfold if the deal between the EU and Turkey were to break down because of a deterioration in relations between the two sides. Most seriously, popular disaffection with the political order in Europe remains substantial, which is likely to fuel support for anti-establishment parties and bring about destabilising political realignments across the continent in the coming years.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has sought to re-energise the Franco-German partnership, and in an ambitious speech in September laid out sweeping plans for EU and euro zone reform. His ideas for a euro zone budget and finance minister will face strong resistance in Germany. Plans for greater EU integration in areas such as defence and tax harmonisation have a greater chance of success, although progress is unlikely to be possible until a new German government is formed. Many of Mr Macron's ideas are not new-and some enjoy widespread support in the EU already-but the energy he is putting into championing his vision for Europe marks a sharp change from the more managerial European leadership style of Ms Merkel. The problem is that there is little appetite for some of his bolder ideas in Germany or elsewhere in Europe.
German election delivers blow to coalition parties
The centre-right CDU, together with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, won the largest vote share in Germany's federal election on September 24th, with 32.9% of the vote. The centre-left SPD scored its worst result in the post-war period, with 20.5% of the vote. The far-right, populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 12.6%, enough to enter the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament) for the first time, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) re-entered the Bundestag, with 10.7% of the vote. The other, smaller parties, the Left Party and The Greens, were also beneficiaries of popular dissatisfaction with the political mainstream, winning 9.2% and 8.9% of the vote respectively.
The AfD outperformed the polls and did especially well in the former east Germany, where the party became the second-largest political force. Exit polls showed that the issue of migration and refugees was the main reason given for voting for the AfD, with many voters also indicating that this was a protest vote. The CDU and the SPD tried to downplay the issue in the campaign, which goes some way to explaining both the success of the AfD and the drop in vote share for the two large mainstream parties.
Conventional politics upended across the continent
Recent elections across Europe have followed the German pattern, in that electorates are increasingly favouring alternative or populist parties over the mainstream parties and candidates. The result has been more political fragmentation, protracted negotiations to form a government and the emergence of unusual government coalitions. Elections held in the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Iceland and the Czech Republic in 2017 illustrate the trend towards increased political fragmentation, as well as a more complicated policymaking outlook.
The parliamentary election in the Netherlands on March 15th 2017 led to a fragmented result, with the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) winning the most seats in the 150-seat parliament, with 33, down from 41 in 2012. The right-wing, populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, which is the main outlet for public frustration with much of the traditional political mainstream, came second, albeit with 13 seats fewer than the VVD.
After almost seven months of negotiations following the parliamentary election, in early October the VVD, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Democrats 66 (D66) and the Christian Union (CU) finalised a coalition agreement and the government-the third of the prime minister, Mark Rutte-was sworn in on October 26th. A wafer-thin majority of one seat in both houses of parliament means that the coalition will be under threat from the start from dissident members of parliament (MPs), and it is therefore likely to prove unstable. Risks will increase following the provincial elections in 2019, which function as an indirect election for the Senate (the upper house of parliament). The previous government was the first in almost 20 years to sit out its full term, and there is an elevated risk of this government falling over any contentious issue, given the deep ideological differences between some of its members, especially between D66 and the CU. The Economist Intelligence Unit therefore expects the government to increasingly seek co-operation with opposition parties. Mr Rutte's previous experience in this area should support government stability and we expect the government to be relatively effective in implementing policy.
Despite a slightly disappointing election result, the PVV remains the main conduit for dissatisfaction with the traditional political mainstream, with the Netherlands having been a bellwether for the rise of right-wing populism in Europe since the early 2000s. The PVV has been a mainstay on the political scene since its founder, leader and only member, Mr Wilders, left the VVD in 2006 and supported a minority government in 2010-12. It became the second-largest party this year, but managed to gain only five seats compared with the election in 2012-it now has 20, compared with 24 after the 2010 election, its best result so far-despite having led the polls throughout most of 2016. The party will continue to be ostracised by the political mainstream; however, it is the main opposition party and, together with the right-wing populist Forum for Democracy (FvD), which is now almost as big as the PVV in some polls, should remain a thorn in the sides of the established parties.
Mainstream implosion in France
Despite the relatively poor performance of Marine Le Pen of the Front national (FN) in the presidential election in France in May 2017, the virtual collapse of the established political parties of both right and left was probably the most striking feature of the campaign. As a result, Mr Macron, the leader of a new centrist party, La République en marche (LRM), began a five-year term as president on May 14th 2017, succeeding François Hollande of the centre-left Parti socialiste (PS), under whom he had served as economy minister in 2014-16. His new party won the largest share of the vote in the legislative elections in June.
Mr Macron has promised a policy programme that is "both left and right", and his government reflects this. The prime minister, Édouard Philippe, hails from the main centre-right party, Les Républicains, and leads a post-partisan government with several figures from the private sector. LRM and its centrist ally, François Bayrou's Mouvement démocrate (MoDem), have a comfortable majority in the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), with 413 out of 577 seats between their two parliamentary groups. The government also benefits from informal support from a "constructive group" of 35 deputies from Les Républicains and its ally, Union des démocrates et indépendants (UDI).
Mr Macron's popularity has fallen since he took office, with an initially large share of "undecideds" now rating him as unsatisfactory. This is not surprising. There was an unusually high abstention rate in both the presidential and parliamentary elections, and many people voted for Mr Macron primarily to keep out the far right. Moreover, since taking office Mr Macron has pursued a number of unpopular reforms-in recognition that tough changes must be made now in order to show results within his five-year term-and has also made some political missteps. The resignation of the head of the armed forces, General Pierre de Villiers, in response to cuts to the defence budget, particularly shocked the public. Mr Macron's actions in the foreign policy arena have been more successful, and indicate his intention to restore France's profile as an influential world power. In the latest survey his approval rating had risen back to 50%-a comparatively high figure for a French president.
Mr Macron's public support is unlikely to affect policymaking progress, given the share of support that his agenda enjoys in the National Assembly. However, managing his party may prove challenging. Many LRM deputies are new to politics, and the idea of party discipline is in sharp contrast to the sense of creative disruption that powered the En Marche! movement before the election. LRM's transition from a radical centrist movement building its platform through a grassroots-led, bottom-up process into a vehicle for passing laws determined by the executive is likely to result in some friction in the National Assembly.
Coalition talks are continuing in Norway
Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus that typically delivers a high level of political stability. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing its full four-year term. In the September 2017 general election the centre-right parties in the Storting-comprised of the Conservatives, the Progress Party (FrP), the junior Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals-emerged as the winners. The centre-right bloc controls 88 seats out of 169, giving it a working majority of three. Erna Solberg, the incumbent prime minister and leader of the Conservatives, managed a strong campaign, focusing on policy continuity and capitalising on the economic recovery, whereas the far-right FrP played to its voter base by sharpening its rhetoric on immigration in the final weeks of the election campaign. One notable result from the election was the drop in support for Labour (the largest party in parliament), from 31% in the previous election, in 2013, to 27.4%-its worst election result since 2001. All the remaining centre-left parties enjoyed an uptick in their vote shares, with the Centre Party (Sp) emerging as the best performing party (doubling its vote share from 5.5% to 10.3%).
Government-formation talks between the centre-right parties are ongoing. The KrF's decision in late September to withdraw from negotiations-driven by its long-standing refusal to support another coalition that includes the anti-immigrant FrP-means that another minority government will take office. The Liberals are still participating in talks and are likely to back Ms Solberg in exchange for concessions on environmental policy; the party will probably demand another ban on opening up the northern region to oil drilling as the pressure increases for those areas to be explored. However, it is unclear at this stage whether the Liberals will choose to enter government or remain an external ally. We expect another minority govern-ment consisting of the Conservatives and the FrP to be formed in early 2018.
The KrF's decision to go into opposition increases its power in parliament, as it enables the party to strike deals on a case-by-case basis. Although Knut Arild Hareide, the KrF chairman, has stated that he will continue to co-operate with a Conservative-led government, we expect this arrangement to make the policy-making process more difficult and protracted than in the previous term, when both the KrF and the Liberals acted as the government's external allies. This is likely to undermine government effectiveness, making it harder for the ruling coalition to implement measures sought by the FrP, especially in areas such as immigration, foreign aid and the environment, where the two parties have opposite stances. There is a risk of increased political instability in Norway over the next term, but it will remain limited by European standards.
Austria is no exception to the general trend
In Austria the early election on October 15th was won by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz. The ÖVP won a plurality of the vote, with a 31.5% share, up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) received 26.9% of the vote, unchanged since the previous election. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its vote share by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, managed to edge over the threshold.
After two months of talks Mr Kurz and Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the FPÖ, announced to the press on December 15th that they had successfully concluded negotiations regarding the formation of the next government. The following day they met with the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, who confirmed that he was content, following introductory meetings with the proposed ministerial team, to appoint the new government. On December 18th Mr Van der Bellen, in line with our forecast, swore in a government comprising the ÖVP and the FPÖ. The 31-year-old Mr Kurz is the new chancellor.
The situation is different to 2000, when the FPÖ last entered government (also in a coalition with the ÖVP). At that time the president rejected two FPÖ ministers because of their links to the far right, there were mass protests on the streets of Vienna, the capital, and the EU imposed diplomatic sanctions on Austria. Although there have been protests against the new coalition, they have not been of the same scale, and the new government has been warmly welcomed by Mr Van der Bellen-who was strongly critical of the FPÖ during his own election campaign-and by other EU leaders.
This shift is in part due to a changed European political context, with right-wing populist parties in power in other EU member states; Mr Kurz's proactive courting of EU leaders, such as Ms Merkel, since the election, building on relationships established during his time as foreign minister; and a conscious effort on the part of the FPÖ to present itself as a credible party of government. For example, Mr Strache praised his constructive working relationship with both Mr Kurz and Mr Van der Bellen during his media interviews, in sharp contrast to his criticism of both figures during the election campaign, and he has agreed to a pro-EU line in the coalition agreement. The impact of the FPÖ's moderation of various of its stances on its popularity among voters and how it responds to a potential decline in support, and Mr Kurz's ability to assert his authority over the notoriously difficult and fractious ÖVP, will be the main issues to watch during the coming months.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP and the FPÖ's programmes, we expect the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, and the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on issues such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election is high.
ANO wins the Czech election and struggles to form a government
In the general election in the Czech Republic held on October 20th-21st the centrist ANO movement, led by Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman and former minister of finance, won 29.6% of the vote and 78 seats in the 200-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament). This is 53 seats more than the second-largest party, the centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS), which won 11.3% of the vote. The new parliament will be highly fragmented, with nine parties represented, up from seven previously. Anti-establishment parties made strong gains, with the anti-corruption Czech Pirate Party (CPS) entering parliament for the first time and the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) grouping, led by Tomio Okamura, capitalising on public fears about refugees. Meanwhile, the senior coalition partner in the outgoing government, the centre-left Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), saw its share of the vote collapse, after failing to sell its administration's achievements. Credit for the economic upswing instead accrued overwhelmingly to Mr Babis, who was the finance minister until May 2017.
Forming a government is proving difficult. The mainstream parties are reluctant to govern with ANO because of concerns over the legality of its leader's business affairs. The police have requested that parliament remove Mr Babis's immunity from prosecution so that a criminal investigation can be pursued into the use of EU subsidies in the construction of his Stork's Nest conference centre. Meanwhile, Mr Babis has ruled out working with the parties on the far left and the far right. Nonetheless, we believe that a minority ANO government led by Mr Babis is the most likely outcome. Milos Zeman, the president, has two chances to nominate someone to form a government and has stated that he will give both to the ANO leader. Should Mr Babis fail to win a confidence vote on both attempts, the speaker of parliament-an ANO deputy-could provide him with a third attempt. Mr Babis's chances of success are further supported by there being no other plausible government at present, as even if all the other mainstream parties and the CPS worked together they would not have enough seats for a majority (working with the far-left and far-right parties is out of the question).
This scenario implies significant policy continuity with the previous administration, and could still lead to a stable and functional government, given ANO's political dominance and the fragmented state of the parliamentary opposition. Alternative scenarios include an ANO government led by someone else appointed by Mr Babis (which would probably result in more support from the mainstream parties) or a new election (which would probably benefit ANO). Risks to political stability may come from further corruption and conflict-of-interest scandals, with the legal investigations into Mr Babis a potential stress point, as well as potentially difficult relations with the other mainstream parties in parliament, upon which ANO may depend for support in passing its policymaking agenda. The Czech Republic has a history of unstable governments, with the outgoing coalition the first in 15 years to have completed its four-year term.
Mr Babis is likely to play a dominant role on the political scene throughout our forecast period (2018-22). A charismatic figure who claims that he is "too rich to steal", he agreed to put his business holdings in a blind trust in January after a bill-aimed specifically at him-was passed to prevent government ministers from owning media companies or firms that rely on state support. His stated aim is to clean up politics and run the country "like a firm", and his movement is pro-business without any ideological slant. He is a populist figure, and has voiced anti-EU sentiments when this has suited his purposes, but an illiberal or nationalist turn along the lines of that seen in Hungary and Poland is unlikely, not least because of his extensive business links with the rest of the EU.
Iceland holds its second snap poll in the space of a year
Exactly a year after the previous early election, held in October 2016, Iceland went to the polls again on October 28th. Five weeks later the Left-Green Movement (LGM) formed a grand coalition government with the centre-right Independence Party (IP), which has led Iceland's past two governments, and the centrist Progressive Party (PP). The government is led by the LGM, which came second in the election, making Katrin Jakobsdottir, the popular LGM leader, Iceland's new prime minister. The three parties have announced their intention to restore stability to the political environment in the wake of two snap elections in as many years, both of which were triggered by scandals surrounding high-profile political figures.
However, the coalition will prove to be an uncomfortable one, and could be damaging for the LGM. Two LGM MPs have already resigned, reducing the coalition's majority to one seat. We do not expect the LGM-led government to last in its current form. The political environment is therefore set to remain unstable and uncertain.
The formation of this three-party government has defied expectations. Not only is it made up of an unlikely combination of parties-two of which triggered the past two elections owing to their links to high-profile political scandals-but the fragmentation of the Althingi (parliament) after the vote made it difficult to form a comfortable majority government without involving at least four parties. The LGM, IP and PP grouping is an uncomfortable one, but they formed a government much faster than anticipated (in 2016 coalition talks took 11 weeks), overcoming policy disagreements owing to a shared commitment to restore political stability.
With robust economic growth supported by the booming tourism sector and strong tax revenue, plans to finance increased spending on healthcare and infrastructure are well within the coalition's grasp. However, this is, fundamentally, an uncomfortable coalition, and its ideological cracks may begin to show as economic growth slows in 2018-19.
Spain faces a constitutional crisis over the Catalan question
Spain has been plunged into a political crisis by a referendum and unilateral declaration of independence in Catalonia. The central government responded by using Article 155 of the constitution to dismiss the Catalan government and assume control of the region in late October, and new regional elections have been called for December 21st. With a number of prominent pro-independence politicians in custody and facing serious charges, ranging from rebellion and sedition to misappropriation of funds, and the former regional president and several other ministers claiming to lead a government in exile in Belgium, the pro-independence movement faces serious challenges in agreeing on the political direction for Catalan separatism after the election. This could take the form of a renewed push for independence or, more likely, pressure for a legal referendum, as well as protests over what the pro-independence movement regards as the unjust treatment of its leaders at the hands of the Spanish state.
Opinion polls for the regional election in December should be treated with caution, but point to a narrow lead for unionist parties. However, even if these parties win, the region will remain polarised for the foreseeable future. If pro-independence formations win the election, the central government would face pressure to offer serious concessions to Catalonia, including constitutional reform. A protracted stalemate or a constitutional compromise that keeps Catalonia in Spain are the most likely outcomes over the forecast period. However, the Catalonia issue is not going to go away and over the longer term independence cannot be ruled out.
The Brexit negotiations will test EU cohesion
The Brexit negotiations began in June 2017, after the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29th, beginning the formal two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the bloc. In the Article 50 letter, Theresa May, the prime minister, confirmed that the UK would not seek membership of the EU's single market. This is in line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and budget. The UK will also leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The UK would like to have tariff-free access to EU markets, but customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and would prevent the UK from negotiating trade deals with other countries. The UK will therefore try to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU and has proposed alternatives to customs union membership, including a "highly streamlined" arrangement and a new customs "partnership" that reduce non-tariff barriers to trade such as technical regulations, compliance requirements and rules of origin docu-mentation. We expect the new relationship to be phased in gradually, to minimise disruption. This could mean continued adherence to EU rules for a period after withdrawal.
A deal would be mutually beneficial, but the risk of no deal is high
On December 8th UK and EU negotiators reached an agreement in principle across the three areas under discussion in the first phase of the Brexit talks: citizens' rights; the Irish border; and the divorce bill. The joint agreement enabled the European Commission to say that "sufficient progress" had been made-a condition for the talks to move on to the transition arrangement and trade. On December 15th the European Council agreed to allow negotiations to proceed to the next stage.
Political exigencies on both sides reduce the scope for an amicable divorce and the risk that the negotiations will break down is high. If they do, and an extension of the Article 50 deadline is not agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal and revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules. However, both sides have an incentive to agree on a deal, given the mutual benefits of maintaining economic, political and security relations.
Brexit uncertainties have been heightened because of divisions in the government over the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Mrs May's decision to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. The prime minister's authority was further undermined by a calamitous speech at the Conservative Party conference in October, prompting calls by some in the party for a leadership contest. However, Mrs May will stay in place for now because there is no obvious alternative who could unite both wings of the party. The Conservatives fear another general election given that the momentum is with the main opposition Labour Party. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last the duration of the Brexit negotiations, until March 2019, and there is a significant risk of another pre-term election.
The Conservatives have formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). This arrangement is likely to work in the short term because neither party wants another election, they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the government's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
In early November 2017 the government was rocked by a series of scandals, resulting in the resignation of Michael Fallon as defence secretary and of Priti Patel as international development secretary. Mrs May's position received welcome reinforcement on December 8th, when the European Commission and the UK government reached a deal that allowed the Commission to recommend that the Brexit talks to move on to the next stage. The deal is an important accomplishment for Mrs May and her government. Securing a deal has also guaranteed the prime minister's political survival in the short term.
However, divisions over Brexit are likely to resurface as the negotiations move to the next stage, as illustrated by the legislative defeat on December 13th over parliament's role in the implementation of a final deal. Brexiteers in the cabinet have been supportive of Mrs May since the election because they want her to hold fast to her earlier pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the ECJ. This faction includes the Brexit secretary, David Davis; the international trade secretary, Liam Fox; the environment minister, Michael Gove; and the foreign affairs minister, Boris Johnson. They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit, who favour an extended post-2019 transition period during which the UK retains single market access. This group includes the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd. These divisions could sharpen, presenting a threat to government stability in 2018.
Political outlook : Political uncertainty comes to Germany
Germany seems to be rapidly catching up with its neighbours in terms of the rise of far-right populism and political fragmentation.
The failure on November 19th of preliminary talks for a so-called Jamaica coalition-comprising the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU), the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and The Greens-shocked the country.
Despite an earlier vow to go into opposition, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) has agreed to negotiations on forming another grand coalition with the CDU.
However, the process is riddled with uncertainties and a new election remains a distinct possibility. A minority government is also possible and might even be favoured by voters.
The collapse of the Jamaica talks was unexpected, despite several warnings that they could fail, especially from the FDP camp. Although officially only exploratory, the assumption was that, in line with historical experience, the start of talks between the parties would automatically lead to agreement. Given that the parties share sufficient programmatic overlap, it was thought that the presence of four parties at the negotiating table would simply make for prolonged negotiations before the formation of a government. In the end, it was not entirely clear why the FDP chose to break off talks, besides a feeling that the parties lacked a broad, common vision. The FDP leadership gave several explanations, ranging from the behaviour of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, during the talks to fundamental differences with The Greens on issues such as migration policy.
Germany politically catching up with its neighbours
This was not the first shockwave to hit the German political scene in late 2017. The inclusion in the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament) of the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) caused a small tremor, despite polls having indicated that this would happen for two years. It marks the first time in several decades that such a party has won political representation on the national stage. Until recently it had seemed that historical experience weighed too heavily on the German electorate to elect such a party into the Bundestag, let alone with almost 13% of the vote, around the same share won by the AfD's Dutch sister party, the Party for Freedom (PVV), only a few months earlier.
The current stalemate and probably protracted coalition-building period means that German political leaders are confronted with another new challenge-or at least a new challenge for them, as the current situation will look very familiar to leaders in many other European countries. One of Ms Merkel's key allies in the EU, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has only recently concluded seven months of coalition negotiations. Negotiations have been in progress for more than a month in Austria following the election there in mid-October, and those in Norway have been continuing since September and were even temporarily put on hold to pass the budget for 2018. Most of these countries have had to deal with far-right populist parties winning representation in parliament for decades, and in many cases the increased difficulty of forming majority governments is because the populist parties are not considered to be viable coalition partners.
The proportional nature of Germany's voting system, as in many of its regional peers, means that as voters have become more mobile in recent decades, the dominance of the traditional large mainstream parties has waned more than in more majoritarian systems, such as those in the UK and the US. Whereas in the 1990s the CDU/CSU and the SPD would together win more than 75% of the vote, they barely managed to win a majority together this year, down from just over 60% in 2013. With the introduction of a new party in parliament and the return of the FDP, party leaders will no longer be able to create a comfortable two- or three-party coalition very often, a new reality that many of their colleagues around Europe have already been forced to confront.
Germany will have to deal with uncertainty
German politicians have never before faced the current level of political fragmentation, reflected in the rise of the AfD, meaning that politicians are struggling with how to move forward. Although the constitutional procedures for the current situation are largely untested, they are sufficiently strong. The Basic Law (constitution) was drafted in part with the experience of the Weimar era in mind, when the country went through significant political turmoil and a rapid succession of unstable and short-lived governments. As a result, it is not easy for the chancellor to call an early election. Even in the case of a minority government, it would be difficult for the opposition to remove the chancellor, as the Bundestag would have to agree on a replacement first.
This framework will keep discussions going, and means that a protracted period of uncertainty on what the next government will look like will be manageable. Ms Merkel's previous government will remain in place in its current caretaker capacity, and although the Bundestag will not be able to vote on major legislation, the government should be able to find majorities for any critical decisions that cannot be put off. The EU reforms promoted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be affected by this, as Germany will not be able to agree on any major legislation, or even the direction thereof, until there is a new government in place. On a domestic level the impact will be minimal. The economy is growing at a rapid pace and there is little need for immediate decisions on big reforms in Germany, giving those involved in the talks the time to work through this situation.
Amid heightened uncertainty, movement towards another grand coalition
The first response in political circles after the collapse of the Jamaica talks seemed to be one of paralysis, as nobody seemed quite clear on what the next steps should or could be. Ms Merkel quickly noted that she preferred an early election over a minority government. Although minority governments have shown themselves to be perfectly workable in many other European countries, that they are untested on a federal level in Germany means that there is little support for this option either among the political elite or the general public.
The SPD initially stuck to its plans to go into opposition, but intervention by the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and public pressure seemed to change this. On December 7th, at the SPD conference, party members approved plans to start exploratory talks with the CDU to possibly form another grand coalition. They also re-elected Martin Schulz as party leader, albeit by a significantly smaller margin than in March. The party leadership had already recommended starting discussions, and with the membership's consent the first talks with representatives of the CDU and the CSU started on December 13th. On December 15th the SPD leadership will decide whether to start formal exploratory talks, which should start in early January and would still need to be followed by actual coalition negotiations. This means that, even if the parties manage to reach agreement rapidly, it will be at least another few months before a new government is in place.
The SPD is likely to make significant demands of the CDU, as another term as junior partner under Ms Merkel will be regarded as damaging for the SPD's prospects at the next election. Should these negotiations fail, a new election is more likely than a minority government. Regardless of the outcome, German politics will remain mired in uncertainty over the coming weeks and months.
Political outlook : Election watch
We expect political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period. In the euro zone, in particular, the negative political fallout from the financial crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the post-war political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that fragmentation and difficulties forming a government occur even in countries that are registering solid rates of growth, such as Ireland, and in traditionally politically stable countries, such as the UK. The EU's cohesion may be sorely tested in 2018, starting with a key election in Italy early in the new year.
Italy is a particular pressure point and weak link within the euro zone. We expect the country to hold its next general election in early 2018, at the end of the current parliamentary term. Because of the fragmentation of the political system and the use of a newly approved, predominantly proportional electoral system, none of the three main blocs-the centre left dominated by the Partito Democratico (PD); the centre right, comprising Forza Italia (FI), the populist, Eurosceptic Lega Nord and the right-wing Fratelli d'Italia; and the anti-establish-ment, Eurosceptic M5S-is likely to win a majority of seats next year. This will complicate government formation, which is likely to lead to the creation of another executive backed by a broad centre-left/centre-right coalition. We expect the next government to be unstable, limiting its effectiveness and its ability to pass long-overdue political and economic reforms.
Paolo Gentiloni, the PD prime minister since December 2016, has had a difficult policy remit, including trying to keep the economic recovery on track while controlling the public finances, managing problems in Italy's banking sector and dealing with a renewed inflow of migrants. The government has been especially vulnerable to political manoeuvrings within the PD and the wider governing coalition. There is a strong chance that parliament will be dissolved shortly after the passage of the 2018 budget, which is due to be approved by end-2017. This would result in an election in early 2018, as we currently forecast.
After Matteo Renzi's flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum in December 2016 he resigned first as prime minister and then as PD leader. In April 2017 Mr Renzi was re-elected as leader of the PD, but this has not put an end to divisions in the party. A large group of leftists broke away ahead of the PD leadership contest and fissures have deepened further as Mr Renzi has sought to position the PD further to the right on issues such as immigration in an attempt to respond to the growing electoral challenge of M5S and the re-emerging centre-right alliance. The tensions on the centre left will hinder Mr Renzi's efforts to become prime minister after the 2018 general election. Calls have emerged for a centre-left coalition primary contest ahead of the vote, and possibly even for the candidacy of Mr Gentiloni instead of Mr Renzi.
A regional election in Sicily, held on November 5th, was the most recent major electoral test prior to next year's general election. The centre-right candidate, Nello Musumeci, backed by FI, the Lega Nord and Fratelli d'Italia, won the contest with close to 40% of the vote. This demonstrates that a united centre right has the potential to defeat both M5S and the centre left. A pre-electoral coalition now appears likely at the national level. Who might lead it currently remains unclear, but support for the former prime minister and FI leader, Silvio Berlusconi (who is seeking to overturn a ban preventing him from holding public office before the next election), is recovering strongly. The Sicilian election also confirmed the strength of M5S, which won more seats than any other single party in the regional parliament, sounding warning bells for Mr Renzi and the PD, which underperformed.
Italy will face difficulties in forming a government in 2018
The 2018 general election will be held under a new voting law, the so-called Rosatellum 2, which was approved by parliament in late October. The law is a one-round, mixed electoral system, which allocates just under two-thirds of seats through proportional representation and the rest through single-member districts. It sets a 3% vote threshold at the national level for single parties, 10% for coalitions and 1% for parties within a coalition. On balance, the new system is even more proportional than the voting laws used in 2013, which yielded a fragmented parliament; it is therefore unlikely to produce a stable government. However, Rosatellum 2 may at least lead to more homogenous results in the two chambers of parliament.
With none of the three main blocs expected to win a majority, forming a government will prove difficult after the vote. We ultimately expect a left-right coalition to emerge, centred on FI and the PD, in order to break the political gridlock. Given M5S's hardline stance towards the established parties across the political spectrum, we believe that it is unlikely that M5S would enter any government constellation.
The next presidential election in Russia will take place in March 2018. We expect Vladimir Putin to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round, owing to the lack of any credible alternative candidate. Although he will attempt to campaign, Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger and nationalist opposition politician, has been barred from participating following a second conviction for de-frauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. We believe that Ksenia Sobchak, a media personality who recently declared her candidacy, does not represent a credible alternative for the majority of the population. According to a poll conducted by the Levada centre, a Russian polling company, 53% of Russians oppose the idea of having a female president, and 87% of them cannot think of a credible female candidate. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would cast doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate.
Fianna Fail could emerge as the biggest party at the next Irish election
The collapse of Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland was narrowly averted in late November 2017. Our view remains that the government does not have the capacity or cohesion to address effectively the mounting economic and political challenges facing Ireland. As a result, we continue to believe that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021 and maintain our view that a snap election is likely in the first half of 2018. However, there is a possibility that it is delayed until early 2019, depending on the timing of the referendum on abortion, scheduled for next year. Mr Varadkar has indicated May or June 2018 as his preference for the referendum, but the topic is divisive, so barring another government crisis he may choose to wait to call a general election if the referendum campaign or outcome of the vote damages his party's support.
Given voter disillusionment with the three established parties-Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Labour Party-we expect the next election to be incon-clusive, as in February 2016. Another such outcome would put greater pressure on Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to set aside their historical differences and form a grand coalition. We expect the election to be a close contest, but if it is held in the first half of 2018 Fianna Fail could emerge as the largest party.
At the 2016 general election none of the established parties was willing to contemplate entering a coalition with the nationalist Sinn Fein party led by Gerry Adams, which had links to the now disbanded Irish Republican Army (IRA). We think that this is unlikely to change after the next election, but a transition is now under way in the party. The leadership is passing to Mary Lou McDonald, one of Sinn Fein's younger members, who is not associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.
In Spain political dysfunction has been pronounced. At end-October 2016, following an inconclusive general election in December 2015 and a re-run ballot six months later, parliament elected Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), prime minister for a second term. However, Mr Rajoy's PP minority government is one of the weakest in Spain's democratic history, and we do not expect it to serve a full four-year term. It relies on just 170 votes-those of the PP, Ciudadanos (Citizens) and the Canary Island Coalition (CC)-in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies.
The parliamentary term ends in June 2020, but an early election is likely to be held in 2018 or 2019. The Catalonia crisis represents another threat to government stability. Over the medium term Spanish politics will remain fluid, with scant prospects for major political or economic reforms until a stronger administration enters office.
The next parliamentary and presidential elections in Turkey are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given Mr Erdogan's popularity, and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect him to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. The president's popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him.

Political outlook : Intra-regional tensions
East-West political tensions are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia is slowly dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place in at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and its breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Western countries have accused Russia of funding opposition parties in western Europe and employing cyber warfare against Western targets, as well as engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West.
Tensions with Russia are unlikely to abate
Russia accuses the EU and the US of interfering in its sphere of influence, supporting the so-called "Colour Revolutions" in former Soviet space. Russia has accused NATO of going back on its post-cold war commitments by expanding relentlessly, first taking in central Europe and the Baltic republics, then Albania and Croatia in 2009 and, most recently, Montenegro in June 2017. Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH), Macedonia and Georgia are now in the waiting room for admission. The Iraq War and Colour Revolutions fuelled Russian insecurity and convinced Russia that the US wanted "regime change" in the country, and possibly the break-up of the Russian Federation. In the face of such an existen-tial threat, from the Kremlin's perspective any countermeasures are justified.
In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and has since been providing military support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. The EU imposed sanctions on Russia's energy, defence and banking sectors in July 2014 following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The sanctions are subject to regular renewal, requiring the approval of all 28 EU member states.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, seems likely to endure for several years. This will serve Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict will prevent any Ukrainian move towards the EU.
Russia will remain vehemently opposed to EU and NATO integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via a popular uprising similar to the Ukrainian Maidan revolution in 2014, would trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt a breakdown in inter-governmental relations has fallen sharply over the past year, as economic growth has picked up across the bloc. The ECB has successfully overcome objections in a number of countries-notably in Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing (QE) has, up to now, not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
The rise of anti-establishment political sentiment across much of the bloc has generated increased pressure for economic policymaking that is focused on national considerations rather than on the integrity of the euro zone, creating new centrifugal forces at a time when policymakers are already struggling to remedy the institutional shortcomings of the single currency. Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. This should ensure its survival in the short term, but the risk of a partial break-up in the medium term remains significant. We attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during our five-year forecast period.
The refugee relocation policy will be a bone of contention in the EU
The issue of refugee relocation is a focal point for existing tensions between integration-minded countries of west Europe and a core of central European countries. In September 2015 the European Council established a temporary scheme to relocate across the EU some of the Syrian refugees who had arrived in Italy and Greece, with the aim of sharing the burden of accommodating them. This was particularly controversial in central and eastern Europe, where governments characterised it as an attempt by western Europe to export the consequences of misguided foreign policies, and raised the prospect of terrorist attacks as a result of Islamist infiltration. Public opposition to the scheme has been substantial across the region.
The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, has said that his country will continue to challenge the EU's policy of sharing out some of the refugees that arrived in Greece and Italy during the migration crisis among the other EU members. Mr Szijjarto's comments followed remarks by Mrs Merkel, who said in a newspaper interview on September 12th 2017 that it was "unacceptable" that Hungary was defying a judgment by the ECJ, which had ruled in the same month that the EU's policy on relocating refugees was legal and proportionate. We expect Hungary's nationalist government and its ally, Poland, to continue refusing to accept their quotas of refugees-in contrast to Slovakia, which has said that it will comply with the ruling. The fourth member of the Visegrad group of countries, the Czech Republic, has yet to adopt a clear response following the election in October.
Tension between Turkey and the EU will remain high
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. This would almost certainly prompt Turkey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period.
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have pursued contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Mr Erdogan's state visit to Greece on December 7th-8th-the first such visit by a Turkish president in 65 years-was a tense affair. Greater co-operation on issues such as trade and security may result, but points of contention, such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea or, more recently, the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the failed coup in Turkey in July 2016, will continue to fuel distrust. We expect relations to remain tense, with sporadic flare-ups, but we do not expect an outbreak of conflict.
Political outlook : Poland undeterred by Article 7 vote
On November 15th the European Parliament approved a resolution on Poland's breach of the rule of law, taking the first step towards triggering Article 7-which is designed to deter serious violations of European fundamental values-of the Treaty on European Union. Such a move could lead to hefty fines or a suspension of Poland's voting rights within the bloc. However, even if the EU were to trigger Article 7, usually dubbed "the nuclear option", Poland would not face any of these consequences, because Hungary will block such a process. The right-wing, conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government in Poland will only harden its stance.
In its motion, the European Parliament raised several concerns, in particular about the independence of Poland's judiciary. It also referred to Poland's failure to comply with a European Court of Justice (ECJ) order to suspend large-scale logging in the Bialowieza Forest, restrictions placed on the availability of contraception and abortion, and the November 11th independence march in Warsaw, the capital, at which extremist organisations displayed xenophobic symbols. The resolution was passed by 438 votes to 152, with 71 abstentions. The European Parliament's civil liberties committee will now draw up a reasoned proposal, which would be the basis for a plenary vote that, if approved, would call on the European Council to trigger Article 7.
It is likely that the European Council would deliver the 22 out of 28 votes necessary to launch the Article 7 procedure. However, it is unlikely to secure the unanimous agreement needed to trigger sanctions. Earlier this year the European Parliament adopted a similar Article 7 resolution regarding Hungary. At the time, Poland and Hungary pledged to veto any such action against each another. The case against Hungary remains stuck, and a similar fate awaits the Polish measure.
Government aware that EU has little leverage
The PiS is well aware that the EU has little leverage over it, meaning that the Polish government will at least retain, and more probably harden, its uncompromising stance. The PiS leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, believes that his main mission is to implement institutional change in Poland. He insists that the state remains captive to the former communist "nomenklatura", which according to him is now seeking to retain its elite status by helping the EU to erode national sovereignty. That agenda is encouraged by polls showing that support for the PiS is at record highs, whereas that for the pro-European opposition continues to decline. The PiS is also benefitting from a booming economy. Real GDP growth has accelerated throughout 2017, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects full-year growth to reach 4.6%. Finally, the noisy fight with the EU is also viewed as useful by the governing party for main-taining its conservative-nationalist voter base, as Poland has long maintained that it is being victimised by theEU.
Rather than retreat, the PiS is already moving on with its contested reform agenda. A reworked version of the controversial judiciary reform-which was partially vetoed in July by Andrzej Duda, the president-was sent back to parliament on November 22nd, exactly a week after the European Parliament vote. Mr Kaczynski has used the intervening months since Mr Duda's veto to negotiate the fault lines that have developed across the PiS-dominated government. The re-submission of the judicial reform package suggests that this task is now close to completion.
We do not expect EU sanctions to be applied to Poland in the short term. However, fines remain a risk. The ECJ announced on November 20th that Poland could face a penalty of EUR100,000 (US$113,000) per day should it continue to ignore the Bialowieza Forest ruling. The European Commission may also push the judicial reforms in front of the same court, assuming that its technical concerns on gender discrimination remain in the new package.
Most palpably, there is a rising risk that Poland's potential share of EU structural funds-already under threat from the UK leaving the EU, as Poland will lose its closest EU ally-could be adversely affected in the next seven-year budget framework, which comes into effect in 2021. Owing to the limited leverage of Article 7, a discussion has begun about linking access to funds to a country's observance of rule-of-law standards. A significant drop in EU funding would have a serious negative impact on the Polish economy. With EUR77.6bn (US$87.7bn) available in 2014-20, Poland is the biggest recipient of structural funds in the EU-a fall-off in these funds led investment to contract sharply in 2016. However, the idea of linking funding to the rule of law remains highly controversial, even among EU officials on the frontline of the fight with Poland. Meanwhile, with the next parliamentary election due in 2019, the prospect of lowered funding, which would have little impact before 2022, is unlikely to affect the political calculations of the PiS.
Poland's intractable conflict with the EU may have some impact on the financial markets by raising investor perceptions of political risk. However, investors have now lived with the stand-off for more than two years and markets are increasingly focusing on the economic boom. Nevertheless, there remains a chance that fixed investment may suffer owing to the risks of political instability and policy uncertainty under a PiS government that is increasingly isolated from the EU core.
With Hungary acting as a staunch ally, Poland will remain undeterred by the EU's moves, which it perceives as empty political threats. Far from being afraid of the EU's rhetoric, the Polish government will use the current situation to bolster its domestic support ahead of the election, insisting that it is being bullied by the union.
Economic policy
Euro zone reform efforts are being stepped up
The threat of a euro zone break-up has subsided in recent years as the region's economic recovery has strengthened and broadened, and as its institutional underpinnings have been improved. The commitment in July 2012 by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to "do whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning point for the bloc, the resilience of which to shocks has also been bolstered by the establishment of an EU banking union and a permanent rescue fund. EU leaders are currently making a renewed push for further integration of the economic and monetary union. Proposals put forward by the European Commission on December 6th included turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)-the euro zone's bail-out fund-into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) that would provide a backstop for the banking union; a stabilisation function for the euro area, which would deal with asymmetric shocks by providing resources to support investment at the national level; and a euro zone economy and finance minister who would oversee the EMF and serve as vice-president of the European Commission.
Some aspects of these plans will meet internal resistance and will struggle to get off the ground. In The Economist Intelligence Unit's view, strengthening the existing structures would be helpful, but such proposals are not necessary for the region's economic recovery to continue in the coming years. EU leaders will lay the groundwork for reform efforts at the forthcoming EU summit in December, although progress will be affected by the recent collapse of coalition talks in Germany, as the country will not be able to agree on any major legislation, or even the direction thereof, until there is a new government in place. EU leaders intend to make a decision on reforms at the EU summit in June 2018.
Upheaval since the EU referendum drives a shift in UK's policy framework
The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. However, a heavy depreciation in the value of sterling has pushed up inflation, eroding real incomes. An assessment by the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) that diminished supply capacity within the economy would keep inflation persistently high over the medium term prompted the bank to increase its main policy interest rate for the first time in a decade in November, by 25 basis points, to 0.5%. Downside risks to the outlook persist, particularly around the Brexit adjustment, and the BoE is likely to go into "wait-and-see" mode following the latest decision. Nevertheless, we now expect the BoE to move again to normalise policy earlier than previously assumed, in mid-2019 rather than early 2021. The stock of asset purchases will remain unchanged.
Another country in which the overall economic policy framework has been clouded by uncertainty is Turkey. Concerns about the policymaking impli-cations of political instability deepened following the failed coup attempt in July 2016. However, since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency, household, business and investor sentiment has improved, and the lira and the economy have continued to recover. Given the healthy state of Turkey's public finances, the government is using the considerable room that it has to loosen fiscal policy and support the economy. Despite its concerns about growth, it has allowed the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy to counter severe pressure on the lira in early 2017 and a surge in inflation. With the US likely to raise interest rates further in 2018 and 2019, inflation in Turkey still well above the official medium-term target of 5% and the Turkish economy showing signs of overheating, we expect Turkey's central bank to have to tighten monetary policy further, until inflationary pressures ease.
In Russia the fall in oil prices, which led to a significant contraction in real GDP and household consumption in 2015-16, has underlined the imperative for reforms to encourage investment and diversification away from commodity exports. Two competing centres of expertise-one under Aleksei Kudrin, a former minister of finance, and the other centred around the Stolypin Group, headed by Boris Titov, the business ombudsman-have put forward contrasting proposals for structural reforms. However, we do not expect significant reforms to be undertaken before the presidential election in 2018. We expect Vladimir Putin, the incumbent, to be re-elected and to continue prioritising social and political stability. We expect state involvement in the economy to remain substantial. Reform of the tax system and a gradual rise in the pension age appear likely. Institutional reform to strengthen the rule of law and protection for businesses looks much more difficult to achieve.

Data based on national definitions.
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely heavily on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This created a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where we expect further tightening in 2018-19. Although we continue to expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in most countries, we now expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive during our five-year forecast period (2018-22).
We expect fiscal consolidation to exert a much less powerful drag on growth in 2018-22 compared with the preceding five years. Almost all European countries improved their fiscal positions in 2009-16, with the star performers being Iceland (by 25.6 percentage points of GDP), Greece (15.6), Ireland (13.1) and Lithuania (9.4). In the EU only Spain and France had deficits larger than the EU's 3% of GDP limit in 2016 (4.5% and 3.4% respectively). Although we expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis. The average EU government debt/GDP ratio was 85.4% at end-2016, but Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal had debt ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the euro zone for many years, although the cost of debt servicing has fallen dramatically owing to the exceptionally low interest rates that currently prevail across the bloc.
IMF and EU disagree on Greek government debt sustainability
A long-running disagreement between the IMF and some euro zone members on the sustainability of Greece's public debt and debt relief for Greece cast doubt over the country's ability to meet a July 2017 deadline for EUR7bn of bond repayments. However, a Eurogroup meeting on June 15th resulted in an agreement to disburse EUR8.5bn to Greece in two tranches in early July, following the conclusion of the second bail-out programme review. The IMF's managing director agreed in principle to support Greece with a stand-by programme, pending approval by the IMF board. However, there was no agreement on debt relief for Greece, with a discussion of the issue being deferred until after the end of the third bail-out programme, in August 2018. The government is hoping to establish a track record of borrowing on the international capital markets over the coming year and to be invited to join the ECB's quantitative easing (QE) programme. These are essentially pre-conditions for Greece to avoid having to sign a fourth bail-out programme. The Greek government returned to the financial markets in August 2017-its first foray into the debt markets since 2014-but the country is still excluded from the ECB's QE programme.
The UK government is targeting steady deficit reduction
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016, and we expect this improvement to be broadly maintained in 2017-22, despite a fiscal loosening in the November 2017 autumn budget. After a better than expected performance, we estimate that the deficit will expand only modestly, from 2.9% of GDP in 2016 to 3% of GDP in 2017, and we expect it to stay at around that level in 2018 as the government eases off from its austerity drive. Automatic stabilisers will push up spending on social transfers as unemployment increases in 2018. However, revenue will still be rising, and in the remainder of our forecast period the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to narrow to 1.9% by 2021 and 1.6% by 2022. The public debt burden edged up to 88.3% of GDP in 2016, from 88.2% in 2015. We forecast that public debt will peak at just below 89% of GDP in 2018, before falling thereafter.
Within the EU, over the past year a number of national governments have shown signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. In 2016 tensions between several member states and the European Commission, which enforces the EU's budgetary rules, came to a head. In early July 2016 the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should be fined for their failure to meet deficit targets in 2015, but the Commission ultimately stepped back from this position. The episode highlighted the growing tension between the strict fiscal rules agreed at the height of the crisis and the mounting political and economic arguments within member states for a greater degree of fiscal flexibility.
The fiscal position has deteriorated across the former Soviet Union
The steep fall in commodity prices and the sharp reduction in export demand and remittance inflows from Russia caused a significant deterioration in economic conditions across the former Soviet Union in 2015-16. This has contributed to a general deterioration in the fiscal picture across the region. The three major former Soviet oil exporters-Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia-were particularly hard hit and drew down reserves from their sovereign wealth funds to cover larger budget deficits and maintain investment as bank lending fell. All three countries have announced privatisation programmes to plug funding gaps, but we remain sceptical about the scope and pace of these plans. Russia completed the sale of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a major oil producer, in December 2016; however, the state retains control of the company. Russia's financing challenges are acute, as international sanctions make it difficult for the country to increase foreign borrowing.
The Russian government faces tight budget constraints as a result of low commodity prices. However, despite international sanctions and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances, Russia placed two Eurobonds in mid-June 2017, which were oversubscribed. In 2016 the deficit was the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of the Rosneft stake. Without this, the deficit would have exceeded 4% of GDP.
The government's revised 2017 budget estimates a budget deficit equivalent to 2.1% of GDP, assuming an average oil price of US$45.6/barrel and real GDP growth of 1.5-2%. We estimate a higher oil price this year (US$54.5/b) than set out in the revised budget, and a budget deficit of 2.1% of GDP, in line with the government's projections.
We expect the Ministry of Finance to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-22, but the adjustment to expenditure is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly given the forthcoming presidential election. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms in 2018-19 as officially projected, although spending will still decline in real terms, and plans to reduce defence spending have been announced. Under the three-year budget outlook the finance ministry is aiming to cut the deficit as a share of GDP to 1.6% in 2018, 0.9% in 2019 and 0.8% in 2020, in line with our projections of a budget deficit smaller than 1% of GDP in 2021-22.
Weak institutional structures, high inflation and rapid currency depreciation have limited the ability of many countries in the region to respond to the economic slowdown with an expansive fiscal policy. Tajikistan, which has experienced a serious banking crisis, is seeking funding from the IMF, but is more likely to receive further bilateral support from China or Russia. The most notable exception in Central Asia is Kazakhstan, which is drawing on its substantial reserves to implement an ambitious counter-cyclical spending programme to offset the impact of falling household demand. The country avoided recession in 2016, recording real GDP growth of 0.9%. This is nevertheless significantly below the average growth rate of the past ten years.

In most of Europe monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative, and we expect this to remain the case throughout the forecast period. The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with policy interest rates at or below zero and a QE programme that will run at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The economic recovery in the euro zone has strengthened this year and become more broad based. Evidence of slack in the labour market suggests that the recovery in domestic demand has further to go, and the pick-up in external demand within the region should have a self-reinforcing effect. We expect a healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 2.4%. The pace of growth should ease to a still solid 2.1% in 2018.
We expect tapering of the ECB's QE programme to begin in 2018
The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, but maintains a clearly dovish policy stance, with the reduction in QE purchases in 2018 designed to extend its presence in the bond markets. We expect the pace of monthly QE purchases to be reduced to zero in early 2019, but owing to subdued price pressure and persistent downside risks to growth, we forecast that the bank will delay raising policy rates until 2022, with a high risk that this move is brought forward to 2021.
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle down-turn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. We expect the euro to appreciate further in 2022 as the monetary policy tightening cycle begins.
The BoE is likely to hold rates down until 2021
At its meeting in November 2017, a majority of members of the BoE's monetary policy committee (MPC) voted in favour of increasing the main policy interest rate-for the first time in a decade-by 25 basis points, to 0.5%. There had been no material change in the MPC's assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation in its November Inflation Report since the previous report, in August. Rather, the bank responded to a continuation of positive trends and reversed the rate cut from last year.
Diminished supply capacity within the economy also played into the MPC's decision, which it viewed as necessary to bring inflation back to target in the medium term and prevent a further squeeze in real incomes. However, downside risks to the outlook persist, particularly around the Brexit adjustment. The bank is therefore likely to keep monetary policy accommodative and go into wait-and-see mode following the latest decision.
We now expect the BoE to move again to normalise policy earlier than previously assumed, in the third quarter of 2019 rather than early 2021. The stock of asset purchases-made up of £435bn (US$582bn) of government bonds and £10bn of corporate bonds-will remain unchanged.
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow has led to significant volatility in the value of the pound, albeit within a range of US$1.20-1.27:£1 until April 18th, when Theresa May, the prime minister, called the snap election. This initially boosted the value of the pound, but it fell back sharply in June in response to the shock result. The pound appreciated to US$1.35:£1 by mid-September, after a stronger than expected inflation outturn and commentary from the BoE that revived expectations of tighter monetary policy, but slipped back to US$1.33:£1 after the fifth round of Brexit talks ended in deadlock. It rallied to US$1.35:£1 after the December 8th Brexit breakthrough on first-phase topics. We forecast that sterling will depreciate against the US dollar and the euro on average in the next couple of years as the economy slows. However, we expect the pound to make a gradual recovery against the dollar in the final years of the forecast period.
Policy to be kept tight to support the Turkish lira and lower inflation
Political pressure on the BoE to lower interest rates in order to support economic activity increased again towards the end of 2017, following a period of gradual tightening. We expect that the bank will have to tighten policy further in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) balance sheet tapering. We expect the BoE to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and from November 2017 will only be funding the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 25 basis points, to 12.25% in late April, where it has since remained. The weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has therefore increased to 12.25%, from 12% previously. This is well above its level of 7.8% in November 2016.
The BoE is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy framework to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and on a generally depreciating path against all major currencies since mid-2013, when the prospect of a gradual reduction in ultra-loose global liquidity and an eventual tightening of policy took shape. Amid further bouts of volatility we estimate that the lira will depreciate against the US dollar in 2017, to an annual average of TL3.66:US$1, a fall of 17.4% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.28:US$1 in 2022. The lira will depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-22. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Inflationary pressures have continued to weaken in Russia in 2017
In Russia inflation averaged 15.5% in 2015 as the sharp depreciation of the rouble in the fourth quarter of 2014 fed through into high import prices. A combination of weak demand and relatively tight monetary policy by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) led to significant disinflation in 2016; full-year inflation averaged 7%. Inflation fell from 5.4% year on year in December 2016 to 2.7% in October 2017, well within the CBR's end-of-year inflation target (currently set at 4%). Disinflation has been assisted by strong harvests in 2016 and 2017, as well as by the relative strength of the rouble. We estimate that consumer price inflation will average 3.7% this year. A tightening of the Fed's monetary policy will lead to a modest depreciation of the rouble in 2018, but external inflationary pressures are likely to be relatively low. Tax changes in 2019 are expected to push up inflation to 4.7% that year. We expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-the 4% target in 2018-22.
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of tightening by the Fed. However, we do not see significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of a strong tourism performance have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2018.
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which have hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan both officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, the commitment of both countries to a free float would be seriously tested in the event of further oil volatility. We would expect the central banks of both countries to intervene-at least temporarily-in such a scenario to prevent sharp fluctuations in the currency and to maintain financial and monetary stability.
The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) had to grapple with a serious banking crisis in 2016 and struggled to restore confidence in the manat following the devaluation in December 2015. Ten banks failed in 2016, which further undermined confidence in the banking system and encouraged a flight to the US dollar. In early 2017 substantial foreign-exchange reserves from the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ, the sovereign wealth fund) were made available to the CBA in an effort to restore confidence in the currency. This appears to have had a positive effect on sentiment.
Officially, the CBA is seeking to establish a free-floating currency and a monetary policy focused on inflation targeting. However, it does not currently have the monetary policy levers to control inflation effectively through open market operations. The financial sector is small, banking penetration rates are low, and the transmission mechanism between the cost of CBA lending and the money supply is weak. Dollarisation of the economy remains high, and oil prices will continue to play a dominant role in shaping inflation expectations, the exchange rate and the money supply.
Uzbekistan liberalises the som
In a significant move on September 5th the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) ended its long-running policy of administratively supporting the official exchange rate of the som on a crawling peg, allowing it to float freely. This move saw the official exchange rate converge to the black market rate of Som8,100:US$1, marking a depreciation of almost 50%. The president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, had announced in November 2016 that he would liberalise the exchange rate, allowing it to be determined by market forces. Following his announcement, the som's crawling peg was allowed to depreciate at a faster pace. Ahead of the currency liberalisation, the authorities implemented measures aimed at stemming the use of the black market. For example, after the government issued a decree, GM Uzbekistan, the country's largest automobile manufacturer, abandoned its practice of selling vehicles in foreign currency (primarily US dollars) in June. In addition to allowing the som's depreciation, Mr Mirziyoyev also sanctioned the relaxation of some stringent capital controls on foreign currency for businesses and individuals. Enterprises registered in Uzbekistan are now permitted to buy and sell currency for any purpose, including imports and the repatriation of profits (previously subject to controls). However, Uzbek citizens are still required to credit hard foreign currency to debit cards for spending abroad, leaving in place one significant capital control despite the currency reform. The Mirziyoyev administration has indicated that it will further reduce capital controls in the coming months, which will aid domestic competiveness. After depreciating in 2017-18, we expect broadly stable global commodity prices to bring about a modest appreciation of the manat against the US dollar in 2019-22.
Non-commodity exporters' currencies should stabilise from 2017
The currencies of most non-commodity exporters should continue to stabilise, as the main price adjustment from lower remittances from Russia and the more subdued regional growth outlook has now taken place. However, the outlook remains uncertain. Weaker than forecast commodity prices or a return to fighting in eastern Ukraine could trigger another bout of currency volatility in Russia, which would be transmitted to most of the regional economies. Currency volatility has led to the increased dollarisation of many economies in the region, which will hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy and the ability of the central banks to stabilise inflation and output.

The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth in 2016 was firm, at 1.8%, albeit a modest slowdown from 2.3% growth in 2015. The latest GDP data point to a slowdown in the UK economy in 2017. Real GDP in the third quarter increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter, and by 1.5% year on year, slowing from 1.8% year-on-year growth in the first quarter. We expect a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in full-year 2017, to 1.6%. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to slow further, to an average of 1.5% per year in 2018-19. Rising cost pressures and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU are likely to weigh more heavily on economic activity over the next two years.
Mitigating the extent of the economic slowdown this year and in 2018 will be a deceleration in the pace of import growth as export volumes benefit from the depreciation of sterling. A deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU is likely to be phased in from 2019. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to accelerate to 1.9% on average in 2021-22.
The economic impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU on the wider regional economy could be substantial. In addition to the direct effect via trade and investment channels, over time the referendum result is also likely to compound centrifugal political and institutional dynamics in the EU and the euro zone. However, the short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe as a whole.
The economic expansion in Europe has gained momentum as the recovery that has been building since 2013 has broadened and become more entrenched. We expect EU28 growth to accelerate this year, from 1.9% in 2016 to 2.4%, before slowing to an annual average of 1.8% in 2018-22. This upswing mitigates the risk to the region's economic prospects from external factors, notably monetary policy tightening in the US and an expected slowdown in China.

Outlook for the euro zone will remain challenging
The economic recovery in the euro zone has gained momentum, and after average growth of 1.9% in 2015-16 we expect a healthy expansion of 2.4% this year, and annual average growth of 1.7% in 2018-22. In our view the economic recovery has further to run, partly because it is rooted in factors that will underpin sustainable demand, such as rising employment and household deleveraging. Furthermore, there remains significant slack in the euro zone economy that has yet to be absorbed.
Nevertheless, the longer-term outlook for the single currency area will remain challenging. Demographic factors will begin to exert a more powerful drag on an increasing number of countries in the bloc. We do not expect policymakers to find a game-changing solution to remedy some of the euro zone's institutional shortcomings. In particular, they are unlikely to reform the bloc's fiscal policy framework. This means that tensions will persist between member states over targets for budget deficits, and it is almost inconceivable that the bloc's fiscal authorities will significantly ease the pressure on their monetary counterparts by pursuing an actively expansionary policy.
The Visegrad countries can look forward to above-average growth rates
Much of central and eastern Europe also faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding in particular will see real GDP growth well above the EU average over 2018-22. A deadline at the end of 2015 for fund drawdowns from the EU's 2007-13 fiscal period brought an end to a surge in investment spending. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to begin in 2016, holding back activity last year, but funds began to flow again in 2017 and projects are under way that will lift economic growth rates during the forecast period. We expect that growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-will remain solid. The German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Within central and eastern Europe there are some divergences in terms of average growth rates and overall economic performance, and we expect these to persist. The Visegrad states-the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland-are set to record healthy growth rates in 2018-22, with low oil prices, significant trade integration with Germany, generally weighty and competitive external sectors (measured as exports relative to GDP), and a much smaller fiscal drag than previously supporting growth.
In south-east Europe the situation is also improving following a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery, with growth rates in the region set to equal, or even better, those of the Visegrad states and the Baltics in 2018. On the downside, slow progress on structural reforms, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth.
Growth in the Czech Republic-the star performer in 2015, with 5.4% growth-slowed to 2.5% in 2016, but is estimated to reach 4.5% in 2017 and an average 2.6% per year in 2018-22. In Slovakia real GDP growth slowed from 3.9% in 2015 to 3.3% in 2016; we expect this annual growth rate to be maintained on average over 2018-22. In Hungary growth slowed to 2.1% in 2016, from 3.3% in 2015, but is expected to pick up to 3.8% this year and to average 2.3% per year in 2018-22. In Poland real GDP growth slowed from 3.8% in 2015 to 2.9% in 2016, reflecting a deterioration in policy and the impact of the tail-off in EU-funded projects. We expect real GDP growth to rebound to 4.6% in 2017 and to expand at an average annual rate of 3.3% in 2018-22.
Economic activity is picking up in south-east Europe
In south-east Europe the situation is generally improving after a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery. We expect continued strong real GDP growth in the region's biggest economy, Romania, which grew by 4.8% in 2016. We expect growth of 7.2% this year and average annual growth of about 4.3% per year in 2018-22. However, rapid wage growth is driving a consumer boom that is sucking in imports and inflating the current-account deficit, and tax cuts have widened the fiscal deficit. Bulgaria will also maintain the momentum established in 2015, with growth in 2017 expected to average 3.8%. In 2018-22 we expect real GDP growth to average 3% per year in Bulgaria. This sustained pick-up is driven by improved performance in the euro zone, robust export performance and increased expenditure on infrastructure projects, which received a boost from a surge in the inflow of EU funds.
Growth in the western Balkans to accelerate; Baltics and Visegrad to slow
We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans (Albania, BiH, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) of about 2.8% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018, up from an annual average of 2.7% in 2015-16. Growth in the three Baltic states is estimated at 4.3% in 2017 and we expect it to average 3.4% per year in 2018-19.
Economic activity in the western Balkans has picked up in the past two years, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices. In 2015-16 private investment and exports were the main drivers of growth in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, with private consumption remaining weak, pointing to a more balanced growth trajectory. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the global economic crisis in 2007-09, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some notable exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the region should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. We do not think that the fallout from the Brexit vote will be unduly negative for the Balkans, whose slow progress towards EU membership is set to continue.
Croatia was the worst-performing economy in the former communist region in 2009-15, when annual growth averaged -1.6%. It emerged from six years of recession in 2015 with growth of 2.3%. Growth accelerated to 3.1% per year in 2016-17, driven by private consumption and investment, and benefiting from favourable base effects and cyclical factors, including low international oil prices and a record tourism season. In 2018-22 we forecast that real GDP will expand by an average of 2.7% per year. Absorption of EU funds is improving. Nevertheless, the economy will only reach its 2008 level towards the end of the forecast period. Croatia is still at a relatively early stage in the reform process and is working off the excesses of the pre-crisis years. The need to pay down large public- and private-sector debt, a deteriorating demographic picture, poor competitiveness and a subdued external outlook will all contribute to the weak trend growth rate.
Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter during this period, government consumption also by nearly a quarter, house-hold consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery that got under way in 2017 is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. We estimate that real GDP will expand by 1.3% in 2017 and forecast 1.8% average growth per year in 2018-22.
In Turkey domestic political instability, the perceived risk of terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook weighed on the economy in 2015-16, but relative stability following the April 2017 presidential reform referendum and fiscal stimulus measures have supported a rebound to estimated growth of 5.5% in 2017 (following the release of third-quarter data, this figure is likely to be revised up to 7-7.5%) and an average of 4.2% per year in 2018-22. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey triggered by tighter than currently expected US monetary policy. This is not our central forecast, but the risk of it happening has risen.
Russia's economy has moved into a recovery phase this year
Although low energy prices contributed to a modest recovery in EU growth in 2015, they triggered a deep recession across most of the former Soviet Union. The weakness of the Russian economy, which is an important driver of economies in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), held down growth across the rest of the region, largely through low remittances and export demand. In Russia real GDP contracted by 2.8% in 2015 and remained in negative territory in 2016, as oil prices remained low and households and companies continued to deleverage. Household incomes declined in real terms for a second successive year. This was compounded by a contractionary fiscal policy. The weak banking sector and high political risk continued to depress investment. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan likewise faced the combined impact of contracting household and government expenditure and corporate deleveraging in 2016. Russian GDP fell by 0.2% in 2016. Kazakhstan's economy posted low growth of just 0.9%, and real GDP in Azerbaijan declined by 3.1%.
Growth in Russia is expected to have rebounded moderately in 2017, driven by a recovery in commodity prices, which has encouraged a strengthening of the rouble and household spending power and helped the banking sector to start to stabilise, allowing for a modest recovery in investment. We expect real GDP growth of an estimated 1.8% in 2017 and a forecast annual average of 1.7% in 2018-22. Risks are to the downside, as household consumption might be weaker than we currently forecast, and fiscal consolidation will continue to constrain public consumption and infrastructure spending. The external political environment remains uncertain, and a further upsurge in tensions with the West cannot be excluded. Moreover, oil prices could remain lower than currently forecast. In the medium term, structural constraints-the weak institutional environment, poor demographics and weak competition-will hold trend growth below 2% per year.
After the shocks of revolution and war real GDP contracted by 9.8% in Ukraine in 2015, before bouncing back by 2.3% in 2016, driven by a recovery in private consumption and investment. Subdued growth in Russia and restrictions on trade will limit the prospects for an export-led recovery. We forecast average annual growth of about 2.1% per year in 2018-22, following estimated growth of 2.1% in 2017, assuming little progress in reforming the economy and stabilising the political system (but no return to all-out war in eastern Ukraine). Ukraine's fiscal position has improved but remains weak, and the potential for political instability to trigger an economic crisis is high.

The slump in global oil prices in late 2014 exacerbated a marked disinflationary trend in Europe, but helped to boost to the region's real economy in 2015, and to a limited extent in 2016, as households benefited from higher real earnings and businesses from lower input costs. Since late 2016 inflation has picked up, with base effects-notably those related to energy prices-providing much of the initial impetus in early 2017. As base effects have fallen out of the arithmetic, inflation has stabilised again. We expect it to average 1.7% in the EU28 in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and to average 1.8% per year in 2019-22.
In a number of specific instances across the region, very different inflationary patterns will be recorded-Turkey, for example, will struggle throughout the forecast period to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% official target. Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high, as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. Assuming that the Central Bank of Turkey keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it again too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of ten categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into ten categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair, although patchy, have, in most countries, been under way for some time. Western Europe's score remains broadly stable, rising from 7.5 in the historical period to 7.6 in the forecast period, and eastern Europe's score moves up from 6.1 to 6.5 over the same timeframe. Across the region, the strongest ranking improvements are recorded by Denmark, Romania and Poland. By contrast, Turkey drops by 13 places, Switzerland by seven and Greece by six.
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets, and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Recent years have brought considerable improvement to the investment climate of central and eastern Europe. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even here. Factors such as a low-cost but well-qualified labour force, proximity to developed markets and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region during the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. In Russia the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. Low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to attempt to open up and diversify their economies. Ukraine has committed itself to an ambitious reform programme; however, its economic prospects will be harmed by disruption of trade and financial ties with Russia. Throughout the region the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. [...]a regional group of 12 nations has declared both the October gubernatorial elections and the ANC vote illegitimate. Other firms are also pursuing alter ego rulings, but their cases are not as far along. [...]the government has bought itself time by avoiding the legal precedent. [...]that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power in the wake of the installation of a Constituent Assembly, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power beyond 2019 if the government finds financing to avoid a disorderedly default or if it manages to boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation will exceed 1,600% by end-2017 and average over 2,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract into 2019. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption and operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2020-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production until 2019, followed by rising output from 2020 onwards as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making the country one of the least attractive investment locations in the world. This reflects state intervention-ism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$11bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages, narrowing the current-account deficit to 0.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Even as Venezuela's economic predicament deepens, amid an intensifying default crisis and looming hyperinflation, the governing Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has strengthened its hold on power as the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has slid into disarray. Although economic crisis has made the president, Nicolás Maduro, extremely unpopular, the government's history of electoral manipulation means that it is unlikely that the PSUV would leave power via free and fair elections. Instead, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition process, most likely ushering the MUD into power by 2019.
The PSUV's concerted efforts at undermining the MUD explain its inability to effect change. Government tactics have included banning candidates, imprisoning popular opposition figures and stripping all power from the MUD-controlled National Assembly, which in August was superseded by a new Constituent Assembly (ANC). The PSUV-only ANC is formally concerned with rewriting the constitution, but has taken over all legislative powers during its two-year remit. In addition, the PSUV has fostered divisions within the MUD, rewarding co-operation from some factions while penalising others. This has often created divergent interests within the MUD, leading to a divided front.
The PSUV's future in power currently depends on the support of three key backers: the state's coercive apparatus (the security forces and military); a sizeable sector of the population dependent on government handouts; and activist groups (so-called colectivos), which are something between community organisers and PSUV paramilitaries. To remain in power, the government will need to ply these groups with resources, the vast majority of which come from PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The key backer in the arrangement is the military; in November Mr Maduro appointed Manuel Quevedo, a general, as oil minister and head of PDVSA. We interpret the move as both a reward to the military for its loyalty and an attempt at a further intertwining of the fates of the military and the PSUV. Regardless, we believe that a prolonged interruption in exports by PDVSA would cause this support to waver while also increasing popular dissatisfaction, as it would exacerbate shortages of basic goods and trigger an increase in inflation (already estimated at over 1,000%).
We believe that there are multiple paths towards a dangerous interruption in PDVSA exports. There could be a disorderedly default of sovereign and/or PDVSA external debt. Legal action in the US (as permitted by the debt contracts) could result in seizures of PDVSA's assets (such as those of Citgo, a PDVSA-owned, US-based refinery). Such actions, if widespread, could curtail exports dramatically (although PDVSA has taken defensive measures that may limit the effectiveness of seizures).
Independent of legal action, the PDVSA's falling output is bound to lead to a curtailing of export revenue. Output dipped to 1.9m barrels/day (b/d) in October (it was 2.4m b/d in 2013, when Mr Maduro took office), and we expect production to continue dropping into 2018. PDVA's US dollar earnings will continue to dwindle, eventually reaching a point where the PSUV's backers withdraw support. There is a risk that the Maduro administration will avoid this fate, if sufficient Chinese, Indian or Russian investment in the sector supports output.
Regardless of the path, a drop in hard-currency earnings from exports will make support for the PSUV waver within the ranks of its backers while worsening an already traumatic economic context. Given the level of political violence in the country, it would be difficult for the PSUV to appease critics by replacing Mr Maduro with another high-ranking PSUV figure. It also seems unlikely that the PSUV would quietly leave office via fair and free elections. Instead, the most likely progression of events would involve the military pushing the PSUV out and restoring order while paving the way for eventual elections. Such a transition is our baseline forecast, but, given the military's participation in the PSUV's regime, its commitment to democracy may have eroded by then and free elections may not be immediate.
Regardless of how and when political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. In addition to holdovers in the colectivos and in the military, the MUD will also have to contend with huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Taking advantage of disarray in the MUD following its defeat in gubernatorial elections in October, the government announced municipal elections for December 10th. The largest opposition parties will boycott the contests, meaning an almost guaranteed victory for the PSUV. However, the centralisation of power means that the results will have little impact on overall government policy. A presidential election is due in December 2018, but both an early election (to take advantage of opposition disarray) or an indefinite postponement are possibilities given the PSUV's history of electoral manipulation. Regardless, any presidential election under the PSUV is unlikely to be free and fair. We do expect relatively free and fair elections following the PSUV's exit from power.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Venezuela has come under increasing regional and international pressure. The EU has denounced the regime's anti-democratic practices and banned weapons sales. Mercosur, a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, suspended Venezuela following the installation of the ANC in August. Finally, a regional group of 12 nations has declared both the October gubernatorial elections and the ANC vote illegitimate.
US sanctions remain the most relevant variable. Such sanctions have made it near-impossible for PDVSA or the government to renegotiate its debts. Given Venezuela's extreme dependency on trade with the US (Venezuela exports oil to and imports distillates from the US), an embargo would cripple the economy and probably trigger one of our transition scenarios. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia, which continues to provide limited financial backing. China, a previous major source of financing, has seemingly withdrawn, as there is no public evidence of Chinese financing since 2015.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government's immediate economic policy concern will be fending off debt default and associated legal challenges. The government has gone into arrears on some sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including PDVSA), while also making late payments on others. Despite announcing its intention to restructure debt, the government has also restated its commitment to pay while blaming payments delays on US sanctions and the payment system. The situation has been classified as technical default. A successful restructuring by the Maduro regime appears impossible. This is partly owing to logistical challenges imposed by US sanctions but also because the Maduro regime has no economic or political programme underpinning restructuring that would be acceptable to creditors.
There is no sign yet of acceleration by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer late payment to lengthy legal battles. Eventually, this stance is likely to change. To avoid PDVSA asset seizures, the government may choose to default on sovereign bonds but adhere to PDVSA's repayment schedule. Sovereign creditors would undoubtedly ask US courts to define PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the government in order to seize its assets. In late November the government reached a deal with a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, which had sought an alter ego ruling in the US court system, but the latter will be precluded by the agreement. Other firms are also pursuing alter ego rulings, but their cases are not as far along. Thus, the government has bought itself time by avoiding the legal precedent. In this environment, the timing of likely seizures is unclear. When they do happen, the consequences for import capacity will be devastating. We assume that they would trigger a transition of power and, eventually, a change of economic policy direction.
In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2018 than it has done so far. However, given previous performance, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find.
Under our baseline scenario we expect the opposition to come to power in 2019, ushering in adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity. We have factored-in a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process;, forecasting lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a non-financial public-sector deficit of 19.4% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.7% of GDP by 2022. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Under our baseline forecast of severe economic stress that would see an MUD-led opposition government in 2019, we expect a restructuring process with external creditors to happen.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits; money supply (M2) rose by 644% year on year in October, the highest rate on record. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government, which implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy, will see real interest rates turn positive.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-19, following an estimated contraction of 12.5% in 2017. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-22 rests on an assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of over 40% in 2014-19.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink throughout 2018 as oil production falls further, but will pick up thereafter, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise sharply, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have caused elevated inflation for the past two years. The government continues to decree maximum prices as its main policy tool to fight inflation, with the latest attempt coming in mid-November. We do not expect a policy reversal under the PSUV government, meaning that inflation will remain extremely high in the short term. Official data on inflation has not been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 45.5% in October, bringing accumulated inflation for January-October to 826%. We expect inflation to exceed 1,600% by year-end and to average over 2,000% by the end of 2018. We continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, under the assumption of a recovery in oil output and corrective economic policies under an MUD-led government. However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50% for an extended period) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Currently, a dual exchange-rate system is in operation, comprising an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom, used for private-sector operations (but where demand for US dollars vastly outstrips supply). The Dicom was suspended in August, with Mr Maduro announcing the future usage of a "basket of currencies" (such as the rupee, rouble, yuan and euro) to replace the use of the dollar. However, the system is yet to be implemented, as the government seems to be hoarding all foreign-exchange available to meet its debt obligations. Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2018, but the exchange rate will remain extremely overvalued. The suspension of the Dicom, coupled with runaway growth in the money supply, has led to a spike in the black-market foreign-exchange rate, which reached BsF88,235:US$1 on November 28th.
We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We forecast a current-account deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 2018, as exports, held back by decaying infrastructure, falling oil production and lack of exploration, will be unable to offset imports, despite the government's best efforts at dampening them (we estimate that the value of imports in 2017 will be equivalent to a quarter of those of 2012). In 2019, with a new administration in place, exports and imports will begin a recovery. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests a recovery in investment inflows, particularly into the oil sector. In addition, financial inflows in the wake of a debt re-structuring, and financial and technical assistance from the IMF, should help to rebuild reserves coverage. This will buttress the stability of the external accounts and facilitate the gradual removal of foreign-exchange controls, as reflected by the converging official and parallel exchange rates.

Abstract: According to the most recent Global Corruption Baro-meter survey conducted by Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, 79% of Peruvians believe that the level of corruption had risen in the past year; this will fuel discontent with the political class. [...]we have revised our year-end inflation estimate to 1.4%, down from 2.4% previously. [...]the current-account deficit will remain mostly stable, averaging 1.5% of GDP in 2018-22. 2013a 2014a 2015b 2016b 2017b 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c 2022c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 16.3 16.4 16.5 16.8 17.0 17.3 17.5 17.7 18.0 18.2 Labour force (% change) 1.2 0.4 0.9 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.3 Employment (m) 15.7 15.8 15.9 16.1 16.3 16.6 16.8 17.1 17.3 17.6 Employment (% change) 0.9 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Unemployment (m) 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 Unemployment rate (%)d 5.9 5.9 6.5a 6.7a 7.6 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.2 7.0 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 2.8 3.2 3.5a 3.6a 2.8 1.8 2.9 2.5 2.7 2.9 Consumer prices (year-end) 2.9 3.2 4.4a 3.2a 1.4 2.7 2.9 2.2 2.9 2.9 Producer prices (av) 0.4 1.8 1.8a 1.6a 1.2 1.5 2.0 1.7 1.8 2.1 GDP deflator (av) 1.4 5.2 2.9a 3.5a 3.9 2.4 2.6 3.1 3.1 3.1 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.5 7.4 3.6a 3.6a 4.4 2.3 2.7 3.7 3.1 3.5 Government consumption deflator (av) 5.3 3.8 3.6a 2.0a 2.8 1.8 2.9 2.5 2.7 2.9 Fixed investment deflator (av) 2.8 4.4 6.2a 4.6a 3.1 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Average nominal wages 5.5b 5.5b 5.5 5.5 5.5 5.1 4.9 5.4 5.5 5.5 Average real wages 2.6b 2.2b 1.9 1.8 2.6 3.3 2.0 2.8 2.8 2.5 Unit labour costs (S-based; av) 0.6b 3.7b 3.1 2.5 4.0 2.6 2.7 3.6 3.1 2.9 Unit labour costs (US$-based) -1.8b -1.3b -8.1 -3.3 7.6 0.6 1.1 2.3 3.0 2.9 Labour costs per hour (S) 6.9b 7.3b 7.7 8.1 8.5 9.0 9.4 9.9 10.5 11.0 Labour costs per hour (US$) 2.6b 2.6b 2.4 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.1 3.2 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Non seasonally adjusted.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government, led by Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio, will maintain a pragmatic approach to macroeconomic manage-ment within an orthodox policy framework. However, political tension will endure, owing to conflict between the executive and the legislature, in which Mr Kuczynski's party holds just 17 of the 130 seats. Passage of legislation will depend on support from the opposition, which is likely to remain obstructionist.
The government is likely to face challenges in the form of sporadic outbreaks of social unrest over extractive projects, rising urban crime and drug-trafficking, as well as potential violence perpetrated by the remnants of Sendero Luminoso, a terrorist group that had largely been defeated by 2000.
High levels of corruption and institutional inefficiencies will weigh on the business environ-ment and administrative effectiveness, as well as sustain public dissatisfaction with the political establishment. The broad reach of investigations into allegations of corruption will exacerbate political uncertainty, with some members of both the government and opposition already under investigation.
The economy will expand by 3.8% per year on average in 2018-22. Although among the fastest rates in the region, this is well below the highs of the past decade, when annual GDP growth often exceeded 6%. Slowdowns in China and the US will curb GDP expansion in 2018 and 2020. Improved external conditions and more dynamic domestic demand will lift growth in 2021-22.
Despite low inflation, rising copper output, prudent fiscal policies and a manageable current-account deficit, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and commodities prices.
Population growth will slow slightly in 2018-22, but the labour force will continue to expand more rapidly than the overall population. The formal economy, despite expanding firmly in recent years, will struggle to absorb new entrants into the labour market, thereby sustaining a substantial informal sector, which will have a negative effect on productivity growth.
Peru is a fairly small (albeit growing) market, and opportunities will remain restricted by relatively low purchasing power, as well as high levels of poverty. Nonetheless, two decades of strong economic growth have fuelled the emergence of a growing middle class, particularly in the capital, Lima. This will continue to support growing consumption levels in 2018-22.

Peru's business environment score rises for the 2018-22 period, boosted by infrastructure improvements. The country improves two places in the global rankings and one place regionally. Peru's key strengths will remain its openness to foreign trade-secured by multiple free-trade agreements-and stable macro-economic environment. A rigid labour market is the country's greatest weakness.
Country forecast overview: Peru's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Reforms to reduce some taxes and streamline bureaucracy are introduced by the government.
2020-22: Government to allow increased private participation in state-run firms, including electricity and water utilities. Policies to induce formalisation in small and medium-sized enterprises expected.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Changes to regulations in order to stimulate foreign investment in value-added mining projects and infrastructure.
2020-22: Foreign investment in infrastructure strengthens, primarily in transportation and telecommunications. Investment picks up in mining, although on a smaller scale than in the past.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Consolidation of the Pacific Alliance, an integration project that also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico, boosts trade and investment flows.
2020-22: Free-trade agreements signed with Turkey, India and Australia. Companies benefit from conclusion of Trade in Services Agreement, a trade pact involving 52 countries.
Taxes
2018-19: Increasing use of "public works for taxes" schemes, allowing companies to invest part of their tax bill in transport and social infrastructure.
2020-22: Further tax breaks to boost labour market formality. Tax credits for large firms that reinvest profits.
Financing
2018-19: Merger with Colombian, Chilean and Mexican stockmarkets continues to deepen capital markets, as does legislation from late 2015 exempting capital gains tax on the sale of shares until 2018 to increase stockmarket liquidity. Sovereign bonds can now be settled through Euroclear, a platform allowing easier access to international finance. Private firms will follow suit.
2020-22: Deeper penetration of the financial system as new mechanisms, such as an electronic money platform, take hold.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour rigidity remains a serious problem, despite government measures to reduce regulation.
2020-22: Government continues the use of tax incentives in an attempt to increase formality in the labour market to 60%, up from 27% in July 2017. Wages increase in key public sectors, including healthcare, education and law enforcement.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The government's infrastructure plan starts to gain steam, with a focus on roadways and hydraulic structures. Broadband penetration increases. New thermal and hydroelectric plants provide sizeable power surplus, opening the way for electricity exports.
2020-22: Government ramps up investment to provide universal coverage of water and sewerage systems. Work launched on third and fourth lines of metro system in the capital, Lima. Gasoducto del Sur Peruano pipeline completed.

Background: More than 12 years of military rule ended in 1980. Following a decade of economic and social instability, the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) ended hyperinflation, advanced reforms to liberalise the economy and defeated the Sendero Luminoso, a Maoist insurgent group. However, Mr Fujimori subverted Peru's democratic institutions and committed grave human rights abuses. His government collapsed over a corruption scandal. Subsequent govern-ments have been successful in consolidating macroeconomic stability, but have largely overlooked the structural reforms required to raise productivity levels. The current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, took office in July 2016. His term runs to July 2021.
Political structure: The 1993 constitution established a presidential regime with a powerful executive, elected for five years. Consecutive presidential re-election is not permitted. A 130-member unicameral legislature, elected at the same time as the president, also sits for five years. The government is decentralising revenue and responsibility to the 25 regions (including the constitutional province of Callao).
Policy issues: The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that there will be continuity of orthodox economic policies and that the business environment will remain attractive. Mr Kuczynski is a former World Bank economist and mining minister, and we expect gradual progress on structural reform under his government. The public education and healthcare systems will continue to underperform, despite increases in funding. The government will also increase spending on social programmes to reduce poverty levels. Despite government involvement in the market, private investment in transport, energy and water infrastructure will remain strong. Bilateral free-trade agreements with Peru's main trading partners-including the US, China and the EU-as well as initiatives within Latin America, will help to keep investment and trade flows strong in 2018-22.
Taxation: The corporate income-tax rate is 29.5% (mining companies that do not benefit from tax-stability contracts pay additional taxes). Dividends and other profit distribution schemes are taxed at 5%. Branch-profit tax is levied at 30% and remittance tax at 10%. Interest paid abroad stands at 5%.
Foreign trade: Tariffs are levied on imports at either 0%, 6% or 11%. The World Bank's calculation of the average effective tariff was 1.4% in 2014. Most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated. In 2016 merchandise export earnings increased by 8%, to US$37bn, whereas the import bill declined by 6%, to US$35.1bn.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio, is now in the second year of his five-year term (ending July 2021) and will continue to face a challenging political environment, as his party holds just 17 seats in the 130-seat unicameral Congress. To pass legislation, he will need to negotiate with the opposition-in particular, the right-wing Fuerza Popular (FP), which holds a majority, with 71 seats. FP has, on numerous occasions, used its legislative power to force ministerial resignations with a simple majority of 66 votes. The political obstructionism reached a new high when FP cast a vote of no confidence in the cabinet led by the (now former) prime minister, Fernando Zavala, in mid-September. The unprecedented move by Congress forced Mr Kuczynski to appoint six new cabinet members to placate opposition parties. However, tension between the administration and members of the opposition will persist. On October 22nd sustained political pressure forced the resignation of Aníbal Sánchez, director of the national statistics institute, for his supposed mismanagement of the 2017 census. Shortly thereafter, Pablo de la Flor, the head of the Autoridad para la Reconstrucción con Cambios, the body overseeing reconstruction efforts following floods that affected Peru in early 2017, stepped down following criticism that he was trying to centralise the process for execution of investment, leaving municipal and regional authorities out of the dialogue. Given Mr Kuczynski's low approval ratings (27% in November), The Economist Intelligence Unit sees a high risk of additional shake-ups in the short term.
Corruption will continue to be a key issue. In mid-November Mr Kuczynski was forced to deny allegations that he was complicit in a money-laundering and bribery scandal involving Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm at the centre of corruption probes across the region. Press reports claimed that the president had received campaign contributions from the company, and was subsequently hired by the firm as a consultant. This development closely follows accusations against the attorney-general, Pablo Sánchez, of his purported mismanagement of the Odebrecht investigation. Nonetheless, despite FP's best efforts to evade perceptions of corruption, party members are also at risk of being implicated in the scandal. Prosecutors are already investigating the leader of FP, Keiko Fujimori, over links to alleged money-laundering operations. Similarly, on November 3rd the Ministry of Public Affairs announced that it was re-opening a money-laundering investigation into Joaquín Ramírez, a former FP congressman and close ally of Ms Fujimori. Although both deny any wrongdoing, the plethora of investigations involving FP and associated figures will undermine the party's reputation.
Weak institutions will allow corruption and mis-management to endure, espe-cially on a local level. According to the most recent Global Corruption Baro-meter survey conducted by Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, 79% of Peruvians believe that the level of corruption had risen in the past year; this will fuel discontent with the political class. Social conflict result-ing from impoverished rural and indigenous communities' opposition to extract-ive projects poses an ongoing risk, given economic dependence on mining.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Presidential and congressional elections, held every five years, last took place in mid-2016. The next elections are municipal and regional polls in October 2018. Presidential and legislative elections will be held in mid-2021; Mr Kuczynski will not be in the running for the presidency, as consecutive re-election is prohibited. Peru currently lacks a formal nationwide party structure, and local-level parties tend to have little affiliation with national parties, leading to disassociation between the results of local and national elections. In 2021 Ms Fujimori is likely to again be the presidential candidate for FP, despite increasingly clear ambitions for party leadership on the part of her brother, Kenji. Ms Fujimori has twice brought disciplinary action against her brother for flouting party discipline. Polls indicate relatively strong public support for Ms Fujimori, which will give her the authority to keep a tight rein on party members. Verónika Mendoza of the left-wing Nuevo Perú (formerly part of the left-wing Frente Amplio coalition), who came third in the first round of the presidential race in 2016, may also run again. However, the lack of party structures facilitates the rapid ascent of personalities and political outsiders.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Peru will continue to support regional integration efforts, such as the Pacific Alliance, an economic trade pact that also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In late October negotiators from the Pacific Alliance met with represen-tatives from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore to work out details related to their incorporation as associate members of the bloc. In a related development, the alliance also signed an agreement with the World Bank to issue a pan-regional catastrophe bond in 2018, the first multi-nation bond of its kind. Members of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended in 2016) have stated a desire for greater integration with the Pacific Alliance, but we do not currently forecast any progress in 2018-22.
In November Peru and another ten of the 12 original signatories of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreed on a framework to move ahead despite the US's exit from the pact. However, the proposed timeline for ratification of the deal is quite ambitious. In the short term, bilateral agree-ments will remain the focus of Peruvian trade policy. Peru currently has 16 trade deals in place, covering nearly all of the world's largest economies, including Canada, China, the EU, Japan, South Korea and the US. Peru and Australia are slated to sign a free-trade agreement (FTA) in December, which will remove nearly all tariff barriers between the two countries. The government will also enter the second round of talks to finalise an FTA with India in early 2018.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Peru will retain a prudent, business-friendly policy framework in 2018-22. Mr Kuczynski has cast himself as a technocratic reformer with a mandate to address a multitude of longstanding structural shortcomings, but progress will be limited. So far, he has focused on three areas: labour formalisation, admini-strative simpli-fication and infrastructure investment. To achieve the first object-ive, the govern-ment has created new tax brackets for small busines-ses, and changed regulations to make it easier to obtain business licences and register companies in decentral-ised government offices, which will also provide advisory services and training to businesses. In July the government presented a bill to address labour inform-ality and working conditions; the outcome will depend on support from FP.
In terms of more dynamic public procedures and administration, Mr Kuczynski has restructured or overhauled procedures at a variety of government entities, including the tax authority, the state-owned petroleum company, the state investment-promotion agency and government bureaux that administer public investment. The administration hopes that a more streamlined government will entice private investment and facilitate an ambitious infra-structure programme (of which a sizable share consists of public-private partnerships). The latter is a key concern, as the administration has pinned its hopes for GDP expansion on infrastructure investment. However, capital expenditure and budget execution rates for public works remain low (by mid-October only about 44.7% of investment budgeted for 2017 had been executed), and the legislature has proven a significant obstacle to infrastructure plans.
Mr Kuczynski will remain committed to reforms to the pension system, and to education and security policy. We are not optimistic about his prospects in these endeavours. As the president's party has little leverage in Congress, FP has free rein to determine the legislative agenda. It may well support some reforms that are aligned with its own platform, but it has shown a tendency to resist some measures for political gain.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
After reaching an estimated 2.7% of GDP in 2017, the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit is expected to widen to 3.1% of GDP in 2018 as the government ramps up infrastructure spending at both national and regional levels. Thereafter, the deficit will narrow as fiscal policy becomes less expansionary. In September the government submitted its budget proposal to Congress for approval. The budget calls for increased spending across the board, with particular emphasis on capital expenditure. Nearly half of the increased spending in 2018 will be allocated to reconstruction efforts to mitigate damage caused by the coastal El Niño phenomenon that affected Peru in early 2017. Other significant infra-structure expenditure in the budget includes a commitment of US$1.4bn for a long-delayed expansion of the metro system in the capital, Lima, and a US$1.2bn investment in public works aimed at improving sanitation. Other key sectors that will see budgetary increases are healthcare (up by 16%) and education (5%). These enlargements are tied to strikes by teachers and medical professionals, which ended in August following negotiations for wage increments. We expect the budget to be approved with relatively few substantial changes.
The government's infrastructure plan calls for increased outlays, and would push capital and overall expenditure to respective highs of 8.4% of GDP and 31.2% of GDP in 2018. However, the government's capacity to implement all the infrastructure measures is in doubt, given its past performance; our forecast does not foresee complete compliance. As for revenue, we expect improved tax collection in 2018-22. This is due in part to reforms at the tax authority and changes to tax legislation introduced in January 2017, which included an increase in corporate income tax to 29.5% and attempts to broaden the tax base. These changes will result in higher receipts in GDP terms in the forecast period. In 2018 these will only partly offset the rise in spending, but will result in deficit reductions in 2019-22, when we expect public expenditure to be reined in.
We expect that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise in the medium term, from an estimated 25.7% of GDP in 2017, before stabilising at just under 30% of GDP later in the forecast period. This level will be low by regional and global standards. Peru will retain good access to financing from domestic and international mark-ets and, should external conditions deteriorate sharply (not our baseline scenario), the country would be able to access multilateral funding with relative ease.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Given sluggish economic activity and ebbing core inflation, the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank) has continued with monetary easing. On November 9th the BCRP cut its policy rate for the fourth time in 2017, to 3.25%. We expect the BCRP to lift the rate by 50 basis points in 2018, as invest-ment in infrastructure is expected to boost economic recovery. The bank will maintain a hawkish position in 2019 as the Federal Reserve continues its tightening cycle, so as to minimise capital flight from Peru. A loosening of monetary policy in the US in 2020 will provide breathing space for the BCRP to implement more expansionary policy to support economic growth. In 2021-22 the economy will be on an upswing, leading to a renewed tightening cycle.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
We expect Peru's economy to pick up in the forecast period, but the annual average GDP growth rate of 3.8% in 2018-22 will be much lower than during the com-modities boom. This partly reflects the dampening effects of forecast slow-downs in China in 2018 and the US in 2020. Growth rates will be moderate and fairly balanced, with private consumption contributing the most, followed by investment.
Growth came in at 2.5% year on year in Q3 2017. This relatively poor perform-ance partially reflects the detrimental impacts of floods earlier in the year. Although we expect a slight pick-up in the remainder of 2017-produc-ing overall GDP growth of 2.7% this year-activity will remain fairly disappointing. Some factors holding back growth will persist in the forecast period as the government struggles to implement infrastructure plans amid transparency issues, congress-sional opposition, and ineffective and cumbersome regulatory procedures that hinder public expenditure and project implement-ation. These problems have been exemplified by two projects: the Gasoducto del Sur, a gas pipeline scheme that reverted to the state after financing fell through owing to corruption investigations, and a project to build the new Chinchero International Airport near Cusco, controversy over which led to the ousting of two ministers and the scrapping of the entire project. Notwith-standing these obstacles, we expect the pace of public investment to accelerate in the forecast period.
Peru's economy will remain dominated by the mining sector, but the main productivity gains will come from the agro-industrial sector, which has grown quickly in recent years. Manufacturing will continue to face constraints related to external competition, fluctuations in global demand competition and a lack of skilled labour. All of this will discourage investment in the sector, leaving foreign investment mainly focused on the mining sector. Services growth will be supported by expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. The continued expansion of an emerging middle class will boost the services sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual inflation, which spiked earlier this year owing to supply shortages caused by extreme weather, fell dramatically in October (to 2%, down from 2.9% in September), following the normalisation of food supplies. Consequently, we have revised our year-end inflation estimate to 1.4%, down from 2.4% previously. Modest demand pressures will help the BCRP to keep inflation within its 1-3% target band in 2018-22, although higher international energy costs and moderate currency weakening will counter this to some extent. There are several risks to this forecast, including sporadic bouts of adverse weather, which could drive up food prices, as well as an unexpected bout of currency depreciation, which would lead to higher import costs.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2017 the sol has been stable at around S3.26:US$1, but we expect a slight depreciation toward the end of the year, bringing the rate to S3.3:US$1. We expect real exchange-rate depreciation to be modest in 2018-22, averaging 0.9% per year. Debt and investment inflows will provide support for the sol. We expect the BCRP to continue to intervene in currency markets to smooth volatility while accumulating reserves. The BCRP will continue to support the ongoing process of de-dollarisation and protection of the financial sector, which is moderately exposed to currency risk. The balance of risks is tilted towards greater sol weakening. However, the risk of sharper than expected depreciation is mitigated by confidence in the monetary policy framework, strong reserves and steady long-term capital inflows.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The trade surplus is estimated at US$4.1bn for 2017 (1.9% of estimated GDP), owing to strong external demand in conjunction with a recovery in prices of Peru's key commodities exports. However, as terms of trade deteriorate slightly and import growth remains robust, the trade surplus will fall to an average of US$3.7bn in 2018-22 (1.5% of GDP). We expect the primary income deficit to remain below the level seen in previous years, at an average of 4.3% of GDP in 2018-22. The secondary income (transfers) surplus will average 1.7% of GDP, owing to high levels of remittances. As a result, the current-account deficit will remain mostly stable, averaging 1.5% of GDP in 2018-22. Peru's current-account deficit will be financed by inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, which we expect to reach US$5.8bn (2.7% of GDP) in full-year 2017. We expect inflows to average 2.4% of GDP in a more challenging international environment in 2018-19, before recovering slightly in 2021-22, to 2.8% of GDP. FDI will not reach the levels seen in 2010-12, when inflows averaged 5.5% of GDP.
Foreign reserves stood at US$63.3bn on November 22nd, equivalent to 16 months of import cover. We expect reserves to grow slightly in nominal terms in the forecast period and, although import cover will ease to 12.1 months by 2022, this will offer adequate protection against external shocks.

Abstract: Stocks are forecast to exceed 2.2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is very high by historical comparison. [...]there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output. Amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products, a gradual shift towards synthetic sweeteners will somewhat lessen demand for sugar. [...]owing to the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market was liberalised in September 2017), these cheaper alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Nonetheless, demand will remain strong compared with many other markets, helping to underpin continued firm global tea consumption growth. [...]this forecast is relatively cautious, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projecting average annual Chinese demand growth of 15% until 2024, suggesting an upside risk to our forecasts. Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. [...]younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base.

Note. WCF (World commodity forecasts) is an index of 22 hard and soft commodities. FFB (Food, feedstuffs and beverages) is a price index of 13 soft commodities. The beverages sector has a weight of 20% in the FFB index, grains 46.4%, oilseeds 28.6% and sugar 4.9%. The FFB index has a weight of 55.6% in the WCF index.
Agricultural prices will remain weak in early 2018, sinking the annual average
The Economist Intelligence Unit's food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index is set to fall in year-on-year terms in 2018-the seventh consecutive year of decline-by 0.7%. This is a smaller margin than the estimated drop in prices in 2017, of 1.1%, as the markets for some agricultural goods, including oilseeds and grains such as wheat, maize and rice are beginning to tighten slightly. Nonetheless, most agricultural markets remain comfortably supplied, following several years of bumper harvests. Several crops have registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. Although there is a risk that a La Niña weather event will have a negative effect on crop yields in the 2017/18 season, therefore pushing up prices, this remains unlikely at the moment, and we have not included an agricultural price shock in our forecast. We expect the FFB index to begin to firm from late 2018, rising by an average of 2.6% in 2019, as a number of markets tighten further, causing prices for a number of goods, including coffee, cocoa and wheat, to recover from rock bottom. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) of FFB goods in the medium and long term.
There will be only a mild recovery in prices in 2019
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw upon. We expect global GDP growth to remain fairly robust, at an average of 2.8% per year in 2018-19, down only slightly from estimated growth of 2.9% in 2017. However, the looming economic slowdown in China and uncertainty about global monetary policy continue to pose downside risks to demand. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. We expect the US dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19, and this will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further inflating global supplies. As a result, even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels, on the back of ample global supply.
Grain prices will post small rises, failing to recover to 2015 levels in 2018-19
We now expect grain prices to weaken on average in 2018, by a modest 0.4%, as wheat and maize prices remain weak by historical comparison. Nonetheless, the price declines in 2018 will be modest relative to those of 2014-16, when supply surged and global stocks accumulated. For wheat in particular, international prices appear to have found a floor after two years of sharp decline. Average world wheat prices surged in mid-2017, as drought in the northern US Plains region and dryness in parts of the EU, Australia and the Black Sea region raised concerns over tighter global supply. However, the damage to crops was less serious than initially expected, and we forecast prices to ease gradually throughout 2018 as the rapid growth in 2017 proves difficult to replicate, before rising again in 2019. Maize prices will remain weak through the third quarter of 2017, undermined by the bumper 2016/17 crop, before inching up steadily over the course of 2018-19 as global consumption rises-particularly for animal feed-and the market tightens.
Oilseed prices will rise in 2018-19 as oversupplied markets begin to tighten
Oilseed prices fell by an estimated 2.1% in 2017, owing largely to the bumper soybean crop in major producers, such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stocks higher. However, we expect the price of soybeans, as well as sunflowerseed oil and rapeseed oil, to see fairly strong growth in 2018-19 as market supply begins to tighten and global demand continues to expand. Only palm oil prices are likely to drop throughout 2018-19 as global production surges, but changing consumer habits-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products-will result in lower demand growth.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We forecast the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee and cocoa, to fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We forecast cocoa prices to decline slightly in 2018-19, by an average of 3% per year; nonetheless, this follows a massive drop, of nearly 30%, in 2017, as a result of soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices are also expected to dip in 2018, as the relatively strong US dollar encourages exporters to sell their stocks, bringing new supplies onto the market. In 2019, however, we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to grow more quickly, by 9%, as several consecutive years of market deficits finally begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2018-19, but by a marginal amount
Sugar prices declined by an estimated 11% in 2017 as the market corrected after a price spike in late 2016 that was related to fears that supply from Thailand would be heavily affected by poor weather conditions. We expect global consumption to expand by a modest 1.3% per year on average in 2018-19 as high domestic prices limit demand in India, the second-largest global consumer. Recent weakness in global oil prices will also play a role as cheaper energy products incentivise farmers to divert more cane to sugar (rather than to its rival, ethanol), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth throughout the forecast period.

Cocoa
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that, after having contracted for two consecutive crop years, cocoa consumption grew by a marginal 0.4% in the 2016/17 season (October-September. Although cocoa demand is expected to accelerate slightly during the forecast period, by an average of 1.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19, it remains fairly weak by historical comparison. Recent cocoa grind data point to a somewhat stronger third quarter of 2017 in Europe, in line with our current projections for a gradual pick-up in demand, but none of the main developed markets will be in a position to fuel rapid growth in cocoa consumption, reflecting high existing cocoa consumption levels per head. In contrast to some other soft commodity markets, where producing countries are starting to become major consumers, cocoa consumption levels among producers are (and will remain) extremely low, hampering the scope for firmer global growth in cocoa consumption. Meanwhile, recent falls in cocoa prices will be slow to feed through to retail prices, which will continue to push some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. The average size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity, but also to protect profits during a time of high cocoa prices. Assuming that bar sizes do not increase, this will also hamper cocoa consumption growth.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in much of the OECD-even bearing in mind the repercussions of a gradual slowdown in China in 2018. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical: manufacturers stepped up grinding in the previous decade in response to a rapid increase in demand for powder, only to be faced with a significant surplus since 2011. This subsequently caused shortages of butter. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounts for 26% of the world's imports of cocoa powder, compared with just 13% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to boost demand for powder.
Higher prices will slow consumption growth in developed markets
Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for 20% of global demand) and Europe (which collectively accounts for 40% of global demand) are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate (with a higher cocoa content), but with less frequent purchases. Recent sales figures from the main chocolate manufacturers indicate that, on balance, this is pushing down overall consumption. This is illustrated by data from 2015/16, which show that cocoa demand contracted in several large markets (including the US and Canada) and grew only marginally in others (including in Europe), despite fairly strong underlying economic conditions in many of these areas.
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2017/18-2018/19. Health concerns and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping will erode spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases), as will market saturation. Europe's three largest buyers (Germany, France and the UK) have among the highest cocoa consumption rates per head in the world, at 3.5-4.5 kg annually. However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption.
Russian and Brazilian cocoa consumption will begin to recover
Lower cocoa consumption in 2015/16 in Brazil and Russia, which together account for nearly 10% of global demand, demonstrate the extent to which cocoa demand is affected by underlying economic conditions, particularly in developing economies, where chocolate is not regarded as a basic good. We estimate that both of these countries saw consumption contract further in 2016/17-despite a return to modest GDP growth in both countries in 2017-reflecting the high cost of cocoa in local-currency terms. For Russia, restrictions on a number of imports from the EU that have been in place since mid-2014 are having an adverse effect on demand for many consumer goods. We expect cocoa demand in Russia to stage a gradual recovery in 2017/18 and 2018/19, growing by an average 1.4% per year. Similarly, we forecast Brazil's cocoa consumption to return to growth in 2017/18-2018/19, averaging 1.5% per year, assuming that the economy continues to recover from its two-year recession.
Cocoa consumption growth will slow in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels (at just 37 g in India and 59 g in China in 2015/16, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets). However, demand will be hampered by high retail prices and, in China, consumer caution, particularly in 2018-19. Although Chinese demand will continue to rise, we expect the pace of growth to slow from 5% in 2017/18 to 3.5% in 2018/19. In India, we expect demand growth to accelerate from 3.4% in 2017/18 to 4.2% in 2018/19, owing to firmer underlying economic conditions.

Supply
Recent data show that global cocoa production surged by an estimated 15.3% in 2016/17 (11.9% previously) on the back of improved weather conditions, after a particularly difficult El Niño event and a severe harmattan season (a dry winter wind blowing from the Sahara) cut cocoa output in many of Africa's main producers in 2015/16. We expect global cocoa production to fall during 2017/18 and 2018/19, by 6.6% and 1.2% respectively, mainly reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire-the world's largest cocoa producer. Its output will remain high by historical comparison, but another bumper crop is unlikely, reflecting lower farmgate prices and weaker confidence among growers. Overall, recent price weakness is likely to dissuade farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticide, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production.
Structural and geographic factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farmgate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa, but farmers also receive a much smaller share of the final retail price than has been the case in previous decades, owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. Many farmers in West Africa remain below the poverty line, and as a consequence few young people in the region are choosing to work in the cocoa sector, instead opting for more profitable crops or moving to cities in search of non-agricultural work. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to encourage people to work in the cocoa sector, but it is uncertain how effective these methods will be in the long term, particularly given recent falls in global prices and weak public finances.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can be grown only in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) and in warm, humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Nonetheless, there are countries that have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of manufacturing facilities to grind beans in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production has soared in 2016/17
In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa production jumped by nearly 30% in 2016/17, to a record of just over 2m tonnes as the sector recovered from the impact of dry weather associated with El Niño in 2015/16, when output fell sharply. However, this upward trend is not expected to continue, and we forecast that cocoa production will fall by 11.2% in 2017/18 and by 2.2% in 2018/19. The authorities are unlikely to be able to replicate the exceptionally high level of output registered in 2016/17, with the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC), issuing fewer export licences than ahead of the 2016/17 season and projecting production in 2017/18 in the range of 1.725m-1.75m tonnes. Although our production forecast is fairly strong by historical comparison, we expect output to fall steadily in the forecast period. Policy will not be particularly supportive: following a sharp cut to farmgate prices ahead of the mid-crop in March 2017, the CCC has kept prices on hold for the 2017/18 harvest, with price levels around one-third lower than a year ago. This has discouraged use of fertiliser and pesticide, with crop disease rising as a result. The government had hoped to raise farmgate prices, but any increase in the producer price would mean cutting export duties and therefore forgoing fiscal revenue, which is unlikely. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from global price volatility, but these funds have seemingly been insufficient to shield farmers' incomes and-given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC-neither farmers nor exporters have confidence that losses arising from low global prices will be recouped.
Ghanaian government will struggle to boost cocoa production significantly
Similar production trends will be evident in Ghana. Cocoa production rebounded firmly in 2016/17, with favourable weather and a mild harmattan season lifting cocoa production to an estimated 925,000 tonnes (well above the official target of 800,000 tonnes). However, we do not expect further significant and sustained growth in production during 2017/18-2018/19. For now, Ghana's cocoa board (Cocobod) has been more reluctant than the Ivorian authorities to cut prices paid to farmers, but Cocobod has been forced to seek a bridging loan from the central bank, indicating that farmgate prices may need to be cut, particularly if global cocoa prices fail to recover. Combined with anxiety among farmers about the government's intentions to evolve agriculture towards other crops, ongoing encroachment by gold miners and the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser, production is forecast to fall by 10.3% in 2017/18, before staging a partial (but weak) recovery in 2018/19, of just 3.6%.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them, while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally three to five years). The authorities ultimately aim to raise production to 1.5m tonnes within four years, also driven by better soil management, and better pest and disease control. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (Cocobod estimates 40%) and a consequent low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). Replanting, in particular, will help to address the problem of swollen shoot disease, which affects nearly one-fifth of cocoa trees and is associated with low yields. However, we think it unlikely that these ambitious plans will reach fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
After falling for the second consecutive crop year in 2016/17, cocoa production in Cameroon will remain weak during 2017/18-2018/19. Cuts in farmgate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". The fact that plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year have failed to materialise, with the area under cocoa cultivation rising by only around 3,000 ha since 2014, will severely hamper the expansion of the cocoa sector.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has slumped in recent years, and the country has slipped from being the world's fourth-largest producer to the sixth-largest (on a par with Brazil). Government initiatives designed to support farmers have not proved successful, with efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and increase the distribution of free seedlings floundering. With the country's mining and energy sector suffering from still-low inter-national oil prices, there is official acknowledgement that investment in raising cocoa production could generate greater foreign-exchange earnings, and the Ministry of Agriculture has recently outlined its ambitious goal of boosting cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. Its short-term goal is to lift cocoa production to 300,000-320,000 tonnes in 2017/18, with the medium-term target of raising output to 1m tonnes/year. However, problems with weak infrastructure, corruption, poor (and expensive) access to financing and weak implementation capacity will hamper these efforts.
Prospects are weak for Indonesia's cocoa sector
The authorities in Indonesia have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these are highly unlikely to materialise. Adverse weather, widely attributed to El Niño, hampered both the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 harvest, with cocoa output registering its third consecutive annual decline. On the assumption of more stable weather conditions, output should resume growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19, but at a forecast 320,000 tonnes at the end of the forecast period, cocoa output will remain weak by historical comparison. Indonesian firms are likely to rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from neighbouring Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America will not be realised in 2018-19
Agriculture in Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, was affected by El Niño; in Brazil the main cocoa-producing regions reported drought conditions, and in Ecuador El Niño arrived late but continued for longer than usual. However, with better weather conditions, output is estimated to have recovered firmly in both countries in 2016/17. Structurally, there is scope for both countries to lift cocoa output as manufacturers look to boost investment in the region in an attempt to diversify production away from West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. However, some of this investment will be slow to materialise, as global prices remain depressed amid excess supply, which will act as a brake on growth potential.

Stocks and prices
We expect the global cocoa market to remain in surplus during the forecast period, but for the surplus to narrow gradually from an estimated 536,000 tonnes in 2016/17 to 98,000 tonnes by 2018/19. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that cocoa production will remain higher than consumption by some margin. Tepid demand growth makes a return to a market deficit unlikely during the forecast period. Stocks are forecast to exceed 2.2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is very high by historical comparison. Moreover, there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output.

Supply concerns will support prices, despite subdued demand growth
After remaining high for much of 2014-16, at around US$3,000/tonne, cocoa prices plummeted between December 2016 and late April 2017, to less than US$1,900/tonne. Although prices have recovered somewhat, they averaged less than US$2,000/tonne each month from May-September, only increasing to around US$2,100/tonne in October on the back of weaker production prospects in Côte d'Ivoire. Although global production prospects will remain weak in the near term, we see little likelihood of a sustained recovery in average prices, owing to the global supply glut. We forecast prices to fall by 2.9% in 2018, to an average of US$1,975/tonne, and by a further 1% in 2019, to US$1,955/tonne.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption expanded by around 2.7% in both 2015/16 and 2016/17, largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries (mainly developed economies) that account for two-thirds of global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the pace of consumption growth to accelerate to 3.1% in 2017/18, aided by stronger underlying economic conditions in many of the large consuming markets, before slipping to 2% in 2018/19. Notwithstanding ongoing monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers, overall domestic demand is expected to remain firm, supporting coffee consumption. In coffee-producing countries (many of which are emerging markets), consumption growth will continue to average 2.4% per year, held back somewhat by tepid demand growth in Brazil (which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption, owing to the sheer size of its domestic market). Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China. Although we expect China's GDP growth rate to slow from 2018, the deceleration will be concentrated in the investment and industrial sectors, and we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, meaning that there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth. However, coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic coffee demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global consumption growth.
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America and Europe, but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets. In some markets-including the US and China-the large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although comprising a small market share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that, in volume terms, the instant and ground coffee market remains larger. Although sales of machines and capsules are slowing sharply after initial firm growth, the coffee pod market will continue to provide important support for overall global coffee demand. Given that most pods contain either exclusively arabica beans or a high proportion of arabica with a small quantity of robusta, this will lift demand for arabica.
Coffee consumption growth in North America will increase steadily
US coffee consumption growth is forecast to average 1.6% a year in 2017/18-2018/19, building on faster than expected demand growth of 6.6% in 2016/17 (compared with our previous estimate of 2.8%). Recent data from the US National Coffee Association show that the percentage of people drinking coffee is rising rapidly (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017). Daily consumption is rising and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products (US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over the past two years). There are indications that long-term consumption growth may continue to rise, with the number of coffee shops increasing at around 3.6% per year and the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee rising from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017, and demand growth among 18-24-year-olds also rising strongly.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers show a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations than other age brackets. We expect coffee consumption growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to pick up slightly, to an average of 2.7%, in 2017/18-2018/19.
Coffee consumption in Brazil is expected to falter
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. However, a sharp economic recession has hampered coffee consumption growth, which after firm growth in 2005-15 has flatlined in recent years. We expect coffee consumption to begin to grow more firmly during the forecast period, at an average pace of 1.3% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. Although underlying economic growth is expected to pick up, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment, rising fuel prices and higher inflation, which will all drag on disposable income.
Fairly firm coffee consumption growth is expected in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia (and the fourth-largest in the world), with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by 3.1% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption growth to rise by an average of 2.3% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. The slower pace of growth will reflect somewhat less supportive underlying economic conditions, after a stellar pace of economic growth in 2017. Nonetheless, annual growth in coffee con-sumption of 2.3% is fairly firm, given the size of the market, and will be under-pinned by coffee sales in convenience stores, as the number of coffee shops is falling. In South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with coffee imports more than trebling between 2006 and 2016 and the number of coffee shops increasing even more rapidly. Although we forecast somewhat weaker growth in coffee consumption in 2017/18-2018/19, the pace of growth will remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 3.1%.
Coffee consumption in China and India-currently both small consumers-will continue to grow. Much of the growth in Chinese coffee consumption will be in the out-of-home sector, reflecting the rising popularity of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres. A significant share of the new stores opened by Starbucks in 2016-17 are in Asia. The company now runs 3,000 outlets in 135 Chinese cities (nearly 600 in Shanghai alone, Starbucks' largest presence in a single city), up from 2,300 last October, and is planning to have 5,000 stores open by 2021. We expect an economic slowdown in China in 2018, but the deceleration will be gradual and will largely be concentrated in the construction and industrial sectors. Given that we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth during 2017/18-2018/19.
Following a recent rapid expansion of the out-of-home sector in India, driven by comparatively low consumer price inflation, rising disposable income and favourable demographics (around one-half of the population is aged under 25), coffee consumption remained flat in 2016/17. We expect a return to growth in 2017/18-2018/19, with coffee consumption rising by an average of 3.3% per year. South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in certain countries (mainly coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam), and rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia, and recently opened its first store in Vietnam.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee (which generally use the robusta variety) in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.

Supply
Final data from the 2016/17 crop year (October-September) were much more positive than earlier market expecations, with coffee production rising by 3.4% (compared with our previous estimate of a 0.8% decline). Although adverse weather related to the El Niño weather phenomenon undermined the development of beans in Asia, output in Brazil-the world's largest producer-rose firmly. Coffee production is forecast to fall by 1% in 2017/18 as production in Brazil declines as the biennial crop alternates between higher- and lower-producing years (2017/18 is an "off-season" crop year). This will be only partly offset by firmer output growth in most other producing countries. Global coffee production growth is expected to be much stronger in 2018/19, at 3.8%, as Brazil's crop shifts to an "on-season" year.
We envisage a growing concentration of coffee production among the world's largest producers. Currently, a large number of countries (around 70) produce coffee, but the smaller producers have been struggling as a result of low world prices and rising overheads. In many of these countries, where coffee is not a particularly important area of the economy, farmers wield less power and are less likely to secure government support than in leading producers. Partly as a result, we expect coffee output in "other" countries to decline from 8.9m 60-kg bags in 2015/16 to 7.8m bags in 2018/19. Output in these countries-which fall outside the world's top 17 producers-will account for 5% of global production in 2018/19, down from nearly 15% in 2008/09.
Annual coffee production in Brazil is expected to remain well over 50m bags
In Brazil, by far the world's largest producer, final data from the on-season 2016/17 crop were more positive than expected, with coffee output rising by over 9%. This could reflect the weak local currency, which incentivised local growers, as international coffee prices are denominated in US dollars. Prospects for the off-season 2017/18 crop year are fairly strong, and as a result of the better than expected 2016/17 result, we have upgraded our 2017/18 forecast, to 52m bags (previously 50m). Although adverse weather in mid-2016-including drought in some areas and irregular rainfall in others-raised concerns that beans might be damaged ahead of the harvest, recent weather has been more supportive, and the quality and quantity of beans have been good. Moreover, the still-weak local currency is continuing to provide an incentive to growers.
The 2018/19 crop year remains some way off, with coffee bushes only just beginning to flower, so output projections remain highly speculative. Local commentators have stated that they believe that there is potential for a bumper crop in 2018/19, with some even suggesting that output of up to 60m bags is possible, which would represent a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). At the moment, we forecast coffee production to rise to 55.5m bags. Although weather conditions have been supportive in most places, some coffee-producing states have seen below-average rainfall, which is likely to hamper faster production growth.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to recover from a severe drought
In Vietnam, the worst drought in three decades hampered production in 2016/17, with coffee output dropping by 11.3%. Assuming that weather conditions stabilise for the 2017/18 crop, there is scope for a rebound in Vietnam's coffee output; we forecast production of 27m bags, implying growth of 5.9%, followed by 3% growth (to 27.8m bags) in 2018/19. The authorities remain pessimistic about the medium-term prospects for production, forecasting coffee output to stabilise or decline slightly. However, government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop, will support firmer output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically high. In addition, firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will encourage growers.
Output from Mexico and Central America will slip in 2017/18
A severe outbreak of coffee rust, followed by El Niño, inflicted damage on coffee plantations in Mexico and Central America, and hampered production during three successive crop years, from 2013/14 until 2015/16. However, a solid recovery in 2016/17 saw production rise by 17.5%, to 19.4m bags, mainly reflecting a jump in output in Honduras and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. Nonetheless, there are reports that coffee rust is returning to some areas in the region, which could threaten output in 2017/18. Purchases of fungicides and fertiliser will help to prop up yields, but we nevertheless forecast a fall in coffee production of 5.3% in 2017/18. Assuming that coffee rust does not spread significantly and that weather conditions stay favourable, we expect coffee output to grow by 1.6% in 2018/19.
Colombian production is set to continue to rise in the medium term
Coffee production in Colombia has risen steadily in recent years, reaching a 24-year high of 14.5m bags in 2016/17. Prospects for 2017/18 are uncertain. The structural underpinnings of the sector are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes. In addition, efforts are being made to increase productivity, with recent additional planting in existing plantations aiming to raise average production per hectare, which at 18 bags per hectare in 2016 was much lower than in other large growers (27 bags per hectare in Brazil and 35 bags per hectare in Vietnam). However, recent cloudy weather conditions are affecting flowering on coffee bushes; if this continues, the crop yield will be hampered. For the time being, we project coffee production growth of 4.1% in 2017/18, but will monitor this closely in the coming months. In 2018/19 production should start to benefit from a 2016 peace agreement between the government and the left-wing FARC rebels, as coffee cultivation will increase in previously isolated areas of the country (the government has speculated that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as a result). We forecast coffee production growth of 4.6% in 2018/19, to 15.8m bags.

In Indonesia coffee production is recovering, but remains weak overall
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector-which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil-have been completely derailed. El Niño brought excessive dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the 2016/17 harvest, when output fell by 6.7%. However, exports have recently begun to recover owing to more supportive weather conditions, providing momentum heading into the 2017/18 season, when we expect production to rise by 4.4%. We expect production to grow by a further 2.5% in 2018/19, but at just 12.3m bags, output will remain low by historical comparison.
Stocks and prices
Following the revision to the 2016/17 coffee production data, we expect the global market deficit to narrow to 2.6m bags, down from our previous estimate of 6.3m bags. Nonetheless, this does materially alter the outlook for falling global coffee stocks in 2017/18-2018/19, as the market remains in deficit and as producers continue to sell some of their old stocks in order to take advantage of the relatively weak local currencies against the US dollar. Even assuming some continued sales of stocks, the market deficit is forecast to remain large throughout the forecast period. By end-2018/19 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 23m bags, from 31.6m bags in September 2016, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

After slumping again in 2017, arabica prices are set to rise in 2018
Arabica prices have fallen steadily during 2017, from an average of US$1.69/lb in January to US$1.44/lb in October. Given that the global market is set to register its third consecutive annual deficit in 2016/17, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often due to a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In recent weeks, speculation about bumper production in Brazil has kept prices low. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock in order to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
We believe that speculation about the 2018/19 harvest in Brazil will continue to suppress prices; we forecast arabica prices to remain flat year on year, at an average of US$1.52/lb in 2018. This is in line with recent developments in futures markets, with coffee for December 2017 delivery trading at well below US$1.30/lb. Given the underlying fundamentals and the likelihood that the next "off-season" in Brazil (2019/20) will hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery of prices, to an average US$1.66/lb.
Tighter supplies of robusta beans and firm Asian demand will support prices
Prices for cheaper robusta have fallen slightly since January, but have not seen the same sell-off as arabica beans, reflecting concerns about the supply of robusta beans in the context of disappointing weather conditions in Vietnam and Indonesia. Despite a sharp slide in prices in late April, from US$1.08/lb to 95 US cents/lb in the space of a week-as hedge funds liquidated their positions on the perception that robusta prices were extremely high-prices subsequently recovered quickly, trading at an average US$1.03/lb in the third quarter, albeit slipping just below the US$1/lb mark in October. We expect prices to average US$1.01/lb in 2018 and US$1.04/lb in 2019, supported by rising Asian demand.

Maize
Demand
Maize is the most consumed (and produced) grain in the world, with total annual demand now in excess of 1bn tonnes/year (t/y). It is a versatile grain, with around 60% of the total used for animal feed, almost 30% for industrial processing (mainly fuel ethanol and starch) and the rest consumed directly as food or seed, or lost through waste. After a period of spectacular growth, demand for maize-based biofuels is now increasing more slowly, even though overall levels of consumption are still setting new records each year. However, following reports about China's plans for a massive expansion of its own fuel ethanol sector, world use for biofuels could potentially rise sharply from current levels over the medium term. Maize is the primary energy source in compound feed mixes, and with ample supplies predicted across the world, it is well placed to meet predicted gains in demand in meat-exporting countries, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where consumption of animal protein continues to expand. Maize is by far the dominant feed grain in much of the world, with annual consumption typically more than four times that of wheat, the second most widely consumed feed cereal. In 2017/18 The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global demand to rise by 2% year on year to 1.03bn tonnes, with stronger uptake expected across the animal feed, industrial and food sectors. A similar trend is projected for 2018/19, with overall consumption rising by 1.7%, to 1.05bn tonnes.
World feed demand will rise by 2% in 2017/18
World demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient, which, combined with other rations, can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. Overall use, however, depends on availabilities and price relationships with other grains-mainly wheat-as well as high-protein oilmeals. A multitude of other factors can also have a direct impact on feed demand in any particular year, with producers having to consider pasture conditions and availability, as well as desired livestock weight, the economics of the meat industry and feed efficiency ratios. In 2017/18 we expect global growth in use of maize for livestock feed to slow to around 2%, down from almost 7% in the previous season. Although firmer demand for maize in complex feed rations is anticipated in China, Brazil, Iran, Egypt, the EU and India, discretionary on-farm feeding may drop back amid smaller predicted harvests in some countries, including the US. Predictions for the 2018/19 period remain provisional and will depend on future maize availabilities and pricing relative to alternative feeds. However, with the upward trend in world meat production unlikely to falter, a further increase in maize feed demand is likely, provisionally pegged at a record 595m tonnes. Gains are again likely to be tied to expansions in Asia and Latin America, but with an expected rise in the US too.
Use for fuel ethanol is at a record high, but growth is slowing
A substantial amount of maize is processed for use in a multitude of food, beverage and industrial applications, including corn oil, starches, sweeteners and ethanol. In 2017/18 processing is forecast to account for 27% of total consumption, rising by 4m tonnes year on year, to 286m tonnes, more than four times more than two decades earlier. Consumption in the following year is provisionally placed at 3m tonnes higher, at 289m tonnes
Trade continues to increase year after year
Global maize trade in 2017/18 (July-June) is set to exceed all previous records, and is forecast to reach 148m tonnes, up by 6.5% compared with the previous season. Amid large surpluses across all of the major exporters, global prices are soft, and maize remains very competitively priced for inclusion in feed rations. A number of large buyers are expected to increase imports, with particularly strong growth likely in Mexico, the EU and Taiwan. This will easily compensate for a reduction in purchases by Brazil and South Africa, two countries that secured unusually large amounts in 2016/17 owing to severe weather difficulties. The EU is expected to displace Japan as the world's leading importer this year, with shipments pegged at a record 17m tonnes, up by more than a quarter compared with 2016/17. Purchases to date have progressed quickly in recent months, with local feed users, many of which are able to interchange between maize, wheat and barley, encouraged by current low prices. Mexico's imports are projected to rise by 1.5m tonnes, to 15.5m tonnes, also a new all-time peak, relegating Japan to third place on the league table of the world's biggest buyers. Maize is a staple food in Mexico, with white maize ground into flour and used to make tortillas. However, direct food consumption has remained flat in recent years, with consumption and import growth fuelled instead by rising demand for meat, particularly poultry. With the renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) currently ongoing, US producers will be mindful of the fact that Mexico has sourced around 99% of its maize imports from across the border in the past few seasons.
China announces plans to boost ethanol production
Years of supply and demand imbalances in China have led to a massive surplus, with stocks soaring to an unprecedented level in recent years. Over-production was mainly linked to a now discontinued official stockpiling scheme, under which farmers in the largest maize provinces were able to sell unlimited amounts into state reserves at guaranteed minimum prices. At the same time, cheaper feed grain imports flooded into southern consuming regions, choking off demand for locally produced maize. Authorities are now working hard to unwind part of these burdensome stocks. Under a plan jointly announced by 15 ministries and commissions in September, the government is seeking a massive expansion of the biofuel sector, targeting the blending of 10% ethanol (E10) into all automotive petrol by 2020. As well as mopping up surplus maize, the move is seen part of broader efforts to reduce China's carbon footprint. Although China is already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels, fuel ethanol is currently used only in a few provinces and accounts for around 1% of overall fuel consumption. The new plans are far more ambitious than those proposed last year, when the government announced its aim to double ethanol production by 2020. If E10 plans are fully implemented, an additional 35-40m tonnes of maize would be required as a feedstock each year.
Processing plants are already being built
China's targets are very ambitious, and it remains to be seen whether they can be achieved in such a short window. However, some local analysts recently reported that more than ten new fuel-ethanol plants are already planned to begin operating in 2018. Depending on how much processing capacity would need to be added, the initiative would require significant investment, tax incentives and probably additional subsidies. The local government in Heilongjiang, the largest maize province, has already issued guidelines on sharply boosting production of maize-based ethanol and high-quality starches.
China's maize stocks are likely to be larger than previously thought
Calls for such a steep and sustained increase in China's maize consumption suggest that local inventories could be much larger than we had previously expected. Our supply and demand estimates for the past decade have therefore recently been revised, with forecasts for feed use across this period lowered by an average of 18m t/y, equivalent to around 10% of total annual consumption. With so much uncertainty about levels of feed demand in almost every country, such revisions are occasionally necessary when new data come to light. However, given the sheer size of its grain economy, any such changes for China can appear very large. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the underlying trend is unchanged from before, and with so much of China's grain economy operating quite separately from the global market, these revisions do not have any wider price implications. We forecast China's overall maize demand to rise by 3.8% in 2017/18, and by a further 5.8% in 2018/19, as maize use in industrial processing begins to accelerate.

Supply
World maize supplies (production plus carryover stocks) have increased to record highs in recent seasons, topping 1bn tonnes each year since 2011/12. Encouraged by high market prices, production gains have stemmed from increases in plantings, as well as improved yields, with growers using new seed varieties, fertilisers and better farming practices to great effect. After surging by an estimated 10.7% in 2016/17, global output is projected to drop by 4.3% in 2017/18, to just over 1bn tonnes. Boosted by ample carryovers from 2016/17, global supplies are still likely to remain comfortable, especially in the major exporting countries, where traders are likely to compete hard for available business. Forecasts for 2018/19 remain highly provisional, especially in the southern hemisphere, and will be subject to revision in the coming months. Overall, we expect global output to rise by around 0.8% in that season as good underlying demand and slightly tighter stocks encourage planting in some producers.
US output will drop in 2017/18, but by a lower margin than expected
With the US harvest about 54% complete by the start of November, we have revised up our crop estimate to 362.7m tonnes (360.3m tonnes previously), although this is still 5.7% lower than the previous season's record outturn. The latest hybrids and varieties appear to be performing well, even under sub-optimal conditions. Advances in seed technology may also have been amplified by improved farming practices, including quicker seeding and more efficient use of fertilisers. There has been some recent chatter about the potential for a modest increase in sowings for the next crop, to be harvested in late 2018. Although prices nearer the time will shape final planting decisions, some growers are expected to rotate soybean area back into maize, reversing the trend seen in 2016/17. Assuming a 1% rise in planted area and trend yields, output is forecast to dip fractionally, to 361.8m tonnes.
Southern hemisphere harvests are expected to be smaller in 2017/18
Planting of 2017/18 maize crops began in September in some parts of South America, with fieldwork stretching through until February. The heavy supply outlook and current weak market prices suggest that a pullback in area is likely. Assuming a normalisation of yields, cumulative production in the three top exporters could decline by about 8%, to 156.5m tonnes. The price outlook in Brazil is especially weak, with average local prices down by more than 40% year on year. Potentially better returns from soybeans mean that more area in the south of the country is likely to be diverted to oilseeds. As safrinha (second crop) maize will not be sown until soybeans are harvested in February, prices nearer the time will determine exactly how much is sown. We expect the outturn to fall to 91m tonnes in 2017/18, a decrease of 7% year on year. Similarly, a slump in South African prices means that sown area is likely to decline later this year, especially if exporters cannot dispose of the large surplus. Based on average yields, the crop could drop by 29%, to 12.5m tonnes. The situation in Argentina is somewhat different. Producers there, still encouraged by the farm-friendly policies of the Macri administration, are expected to boost plantings, with production down by only 1m tonnes from the previous season, at 40m tonnes. The outlook for 2018/19 maize crops south of the equator is highly provisional, with sowings still 18 months away in some areas. We currently expect a modest expansion in South American crops but another static year in South African output.
Ukraine and Russia have become big players on the world market
Maize production in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has increased massively during the past decade or so, rising from around 21.7m tonnes in 2008/09 to an estimated 42.3m tonnes in the current season. Nearly all of the growth stems from much larger harvests in Ukraine and more recently, in Russia, with the other countries still relatively small producers. Farmers in both countries have responded to strong overseas demand, switching some land from less profitable crops, including barley and other coarse grains. Growers have also been partly motivated by more limited state intervention in maize markets, compared with traditional, politically sensitive crops such as wheat. Ukraine's rich and fertile soils appear especially well-suited to growing the latest (non-GM) maize hybrids, where changes in weather patterns have also underpinned very good yields in recent years. In 2016/17 maize overtook wheat as Ukraine's biggest export crop by volume, and the country now ranks as the world's fourth-largest exporter, behind the US, Brazil and Argentina. After peaking at a record 30.9m tonnes in 2013/14, production has edged lower in subsequent years as plantings fell back slightly. The 2017/18 harvest was about 60% complete by early November, with farmers confirming disappointing results in areas affected by a summer drought. We have revised down our forecast accordingly, to 25m tonnes in 2017/18, 10.7% lower (7.1% previously) than the record 2016/17 crop, and slightly lower than the five-year average. With a strong export base expected to encourage plantings early next year, output is forecast to rebound to 27.5m tonnes in 2018/19.
Russia has traditionally been only a small producer of maize, with output dropping to a low of 3.1m tonnes in 2010/11. However, like the situation in neighbouring Ukraine, harvested area has nearly tripled over this period, to a new peak of 2.9m ha in the current season. Most farmers use imported, high-yielding hybrid seeds, which have proven particularly well suited to the country's mid-continental, northern latitude climate. Owing to disappointing yields, production in 2017/18 is expected to dip to 14m tonnes, down by 8% from last season's record but still 18% above the recent average. This will limit this season's exportable surplus to around 4.2m tonnes, still enough to retain the country's position as the world's fifth-largest exporter.

Stocks and prices
We recently raised our estimate of global maize stocks substantially, to 324m tonnes in 2017/18 (206m tonnes previously), following a detailed reassessment of China's maize supply and demand numbers over the past decade. Maize production in China is trending lower, and with consumption expected to rise strongly in the years ahead, it has become clear that our previous forecast was too conservative and would have resulted in the depletion of China's stocks in just a few years. With feed use adjusted lower from 2011/12 onwards, projections for China's stocks were lifted across the whole period and are now forecast at 201m tonnes at the end of 2017/18, a figure much closer to that circulating in the local press. We now expect China to account for 62% of total world stocks (40% previously). Yet with so much uncertainty about the size, location and quality of its stocks, many analysts prefer to exclude China when modelling world inventories. Combined stocks in the four main maize exporters (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and the US) are forecast to remain above the recent average in 2017/18, at a total of 73.9m tonnes, up by 0.7% year on year, with more than three-quarters of these (59.5m tonnes) concentrated in the US. A relatively sharp drop is predicted in 2018/19, to 307m tonnes. Although exporter stocks will also tighten further, overall market supplies will remain at comfortable levels.

China's stock estimate is revised sharply higher
China's grain stocks have long been considered a state secret, with all parts of the grain balance sheet quite notional and based on limited information. Sometimes the assumptions are proven to be incorrect, as highlighted by new information or a change in underlying market conditions. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agencies last made major revisions to their own Chinese estimates in 2001, when the cumulative forecast for wheat, maize and rice stocks was more than tripled as it became apparent that inventories were much larger than previously assumed owing to years of feed use being overestimated. Although our revised stock forecast diverges from those of the USDA and other major forecasting bodies, it brings stocks in China much closer to the levels that have been widely reported in the local press in recent years, including figures quoted by key policy advisers and other Communist Party officials. However, the fact remains that these supplies are held primarily as a food security measure and will never be made available on the world market. Indeed, with China being only a small importer, its domestic stock levels are unlikely to have a major impact on global prices. Moreover, the underlying trend for Chinese maize stocks remains unchanged, with stocks having built up since 2007/08 before tightening in recent seasons. We expect stocks to be drawn down further in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry.
Prices are unlikely to show any significant growth in 2018-19
World maize prices have eased slightly in recent months, averaging more than 11% lower year on year in early November. Although US export prices were initially pulled higher by concerns about worse than normal Midwest crop conditions, early summer gains have eroded as participants shed speculative long positions on signs that final yields would outperform earlier expectations. Light seasonal harvest pressure has also weighed on markets recently as newly harvested supplies added to bountiful US stockpiles. Barring a late-season severe frost, the US crop is widely expected to be one of the biggest on record, and supplies look set to remain ample throughout the next season. Export prices in South America remained weak, hovering close to an eight-year low in Argentina as traders worked hard to secure sales. However, with large customers well aware of the possibility of further price weakness, many have been reluctant to extend coverage. Despite some chatter about a potential La Niña weather shock in South America over the next six months, maize market fundamentals currently point to a low price environment. We expect prices to rise slightly from the fourth quarter of 2017; however, given ample global stocks and easy feedgrain availabilities, prices are likely to stay well below recent peaks in 2018-19.

Palm oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global palm oil consumption increased by 2.2% year on year, to 63.8m tonnes. This is markedly slower than average annual demand growth in the previous five seasons, of 5.4%, owing to low palm oil stocks. We expect palm oil consumption to expand more quickly in 2017/18 and 2018/19 as global supplies become more available, although the rate of growth is likely to remain below recent averages. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are looking for growth opportunities, with the biodiesel market in China the most likely to generate demand. Overall, we forecast global consumption to expand by an average of 3.1% per year over the forecast period, reaching a total of 67.8m tonnes in 2018/19.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
The 2016/17 season has been relatively disappointing for Indian palm oil demand. We estimate that consumption rose by 1.4% in that season, to 9.3m tonnes-well below the average annual growth of 6.6% observed over the last five seasons. Changes in duties applied to imported palm oil will weigh on consumption in 2017/18 but strong overall GDP growth in the coming seasons will help to support demand. Palm oil imports have risen steadily in the year to date; although some of this is driven by stock replenishment, we also expect consumption to rise as a result. On the assumption that palm oil prices will weaken further from their current levels, greater availability will support average annual consumption growth of 4.6% in 2017/18-2018/19.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post decent growth in 2016/17 and 2017/18
Prospects for palm oil demand in Indonesia appear slightly more positive than initially expected. In addition to rising food use, palm oil is likely to become increasingly competitive against mineral oil as a base for biodiesel. The recent implementation by the EU of reduced duties for Argentinian biodiesel is expected to be followed by a similar reduction for Indonesian biodiesel. This good news is partially offset by the impostition of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel by the US on Indonesia, as well as Argentina. Nonetheless, we have revised up our forecast for Indonesian palm oil consumption in 2017/18. While the projected growth rates are below the recent levels, overall consumption in 2018/19 should comfortably exceed 10m tonnes.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by competition from soybean oil
Consumption of palm oil in China during 2016/17 witnessed another year of decline, due to the higher availability of locally produced soybean oil. However, there is some hope of recovery in 2017/18, owing partly to a sustained recovery in instant noodle production, as higher quality products have rekindled consumer interest. More significantly, the planned expansion of biodiesel use, part of a broader biofuels policy, has the potential to absorb large quantities of palm oil. We remain cautious about growth in China's palm oil demand in 2017/18 and 2018/19, given recent declines. An expansion of biofuels use underpins our forecast for steady demand growth, averaging 3.7% per year over the forecast period, to reach a total of 5.4m tonnes in the 2018/19 season.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
The market for palm oil in the EU has been broadly flat since 2013/14, hovering around 7.2m tonnes. We expect this trend to continue in the next two seasons, but risks are on the downside. In the biodiesel sector, palm oil faces increased competition in some member states from recycled fats and oils, while sustainability concerns hang over medium-term consumption prospects. However, biodiesel consumption in the EU is expected to increase over the next two years, reflecting changes in incorporation mandates. While other feed-stocks are likely to be the main beneficiaries of this growth, palm oil consumption volumes should be maintained. Similarly, its use in the edible sector is also likely to be maintained. In the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons we forecast that palm oil use will continue at around 7.1m tonnes.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia faces challenges
Malaysian palm oil consumption was hampered in 2017 by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. We have made a small reduction in our estimate of 2016/17 consumption to reflect the difficulties of the biodiesel sector. The government continues its efforts to get the B10 mandate accepted by automobile manufacturers but the implementation has now been postponed, probably to at least 2019. However, there are reports of increasing biodiesel exports. Despite this, we have made further small reductions in our forecasts of consumption in 2017/18 and 2018/19 to reflect the sluggish growth in the local market for biodiesel.
Prospects for palm oil consumption in other countries are broadly positive
The top five consumers account for less than 55% of global demand, and a large number of other countries also consume palm oil. Consumption growth in these countries has been buoyant, but has slowed during the second half of 2016/17. A number of these countries are the target of palm oil exporters, especially in Africa and the Middle East. For example, recent reports highlight strong growth in palm oil imports into Ghana. The largest of these "other" consumers, Pakistan, is showing steady growth in palm oil consumption. Attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been largely unsuccessful since neither sunflowerseed nor rapeseed fit in with more profitable crops. By 2018/19, Pakistan's palm oil consumption should be at almost 3m tonnes, similar to expected consumption in Malaysia.

Supply
The recovery in yields in 2016/17, following an earlier dry period, ensured strong growth rates in palm oil production. Among the top four producers, only Malaysia failed to record double-digit output growth. Overall, we estimate that global palm oil production rose by over 12.4% year on year in 2016/17, to reach 65.5m tonnes. We expect the growth rate to slow in 2017/18, on the heels of this record outturn, but to remain above average. In 2018/19 we expect production growth to slip further, to a marginal 0.9%, owing to the impact of stressed trees and a slowdown in mature areas growth.
Yields in Indonesia are slowly recovering from the 2015/16 drought
Indonesia's palm oil output growth in 2016/17 has exceeded expectations. The age profile of Indonesia's oil palms explains the strong rise in yields, which have outstripped those in all other palm oil producers. At an estimated 36.1m tonnes, output in 2016/17 was almost 16% higher than in the drought-affected 2015/16 season. Yields are likely to rise further in 2017/18, albeit at a slower rate. We continue to forecast production of over 37m tonnes, representing a below-average growth rate of 4.4%. In 2018/19 the larger planted area is likely to offset any negative effects from the slower rate of planting and tree stress; overall, we expect output to increase by 2% that season, to 38.5m tonnes.
Malaysian production is set to return to 2013/14 peak by 2017/18
Malaysia's recorded palm oil production continued to underperform in September, even falling below the particularly low level seen in August (at a time when seasonal production tends to rise). Consequently, we now exped production of 18.9m tonnes in 2016/17 (19m tonnes previously). Persistent labour shortages, the age profile of trees and lower extraction rates have all contributed to this shortfall. October's production is thought to have recovered based on early indicators. For 2017/18 we retain our forecast that output will rise by 7.1% year on year. There is fear that the La Niña weather phenomenon may cause excessive rainfall and flooding in the final weeks of 2017, which may adversely impact palm oil output. Given the difficulties of finding new land for planting, growth in Malaysian output relies on replacing ageing trees with younger, higher-yield trees. The rate of replanting in recent years has been too low to prevent a slump in yields. As a result, for 2018/19 we expect output to remain fairly flat year on year, at about 20.1m tonnes as yields continue below the usual levels.

For Thailand, the third-largest producer, we estimate that production will exceed 2.1m tonnes in 2016/17. Higher output is putting pressure on local prices of palm fruit. Some local sources suggest that prices are below the costs of production, inhibiting the use of inputs to stimulate yields. We expect an increase in the mature area to ensure continued growth in palm oil output in 2017/18. Difficulties in securing new land for planting will inhibit future growth although the improving age profile will help yields. The slow growth in palm oil output is expected to result in a lower target for biodiesel use in Thailand. We expect Colombian output to grow steadily over the forecast period as its mature area expands. Recent yields have largely been above year-earlier levels, and returns to the crop have been favourable. A higher biodiesel incorporation rate mandate should also help to maintain interest in the crop.
Stocks and prices
Recorded palm oil stocks in Malaysia at the end of August showed a further substantial increase month on month, and remained above year-earlier levels. Stocks have also risen in Indonesia. Our own estimates suggest that stocks at the end of the 2016/17 season will be adequate but below the historical average. With palm oil production now set to reduce seasonally, stocks are likely to remain comparatively tight for the first half of the 2017/18 season. However, over the season as a whole, the market surplus will be greater than in 2016/17 and allow stocks to recover to higher than normal levels. A surplus, albeit smaller than that of 2017/18, is also expected in 2018/19.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further in 2018
Physical prices for palm oil eased in October, although the decline was small. Futures prices were also little changed from those recorded in September. The unexpected fall in Malaysian palm oil output and the low current stock levels are combining to maintain comparatively firm prices. Given the scale of the prospective surplus for the 2017/18 season, we expect prices to be persistently weak. However, there remain significant uncertainties about the prospective increases in production, and markets are likely to remain firm until evidence of the production growth, and the consequent stock increases, is more firmly established. Given the seasonal decline in palm oil production, which typically lasts until February, price falls may be delayed until the second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect price drops to be more noticeable in the second half of the 2017/18 season, bringing the annual average down by over 10%. In 2018/19, as global stocks continue to rise, we expect prices to stay below US$600/tonne on average.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global rapeseed oil consumption fell by 7% year on year in 2016/17. With prices likely to remain high during 2017/18, we expect a further contraction in 2017/18, largely owing to lower demand in China and the EU. Overall, our estimate for 2017/18 rapeseed oil consumption now stands at 24.9m tonnes, 1.2% lower than in 2016/17. We only expect rapeseed oil consumption volumes to recover in 2018/19, by 4.9% year on year. Given the low oil stocks, this relies on improved production levels.
EU consumption in 2016/17 will be limited by availability
EU consumption in 2016/17 was constrained by the availability of supply although improved availability at the end of the season resulted in consumption of just under 10m tonnes; a total lower than in the previous three seasons. The 10m-tonne mark is unlikely to be breached in the 2017/18 season. On the downside, potential usage is limited by the expected resumption of biodiesel imports from Argentina and possibly from Indonesia in mid-2018, which will weigh on consumption in the latter part of that season. On the other hand, the competition in the edible market from sunflowerseed is thought likely to ease as the season progresses. Overall, we have made a small upward revision to our estimate of 2017/18 consumption, to 9.8m tonnes.
Demand in China will be aided in 2016/17 by the release of reserve stocks
In China drawdowns of official rapeseed stocks helped to support consump-tion of rapeseed oil in 2016/17. It is unlikely that a further drawdown of stocks can be used to maintain consumption in 2017/18. The continual downgrading of local production estimates means that our estimate of usage in 2017/18 has fallen further. We now forecast Chinese consumption to drop by more than 7% to only 5.2m tonnes. Even this level will require either a significant increase in rapeseed imports for local crushing or the maintenance of recent levels of rapeseed oil imports. The forecast is vulnerable to any change in price differentials, especially between rapeseed oil and palm oil.
India's consumption will rebound in 2016/17 in line with local availability
In India, competition from imported oils was strong during the 2016/17 season despite good local supplies. We estimate that consumption climbed by nearly 10% in 2016/17 to reach nearly 2.4m tonnes. An improving outlook for domestic availability, together with strong real GDP growth levels, should stimulate additional consumption during 2017/18. We have increased our 2017/18 forecast and now expect rapeseed oil consumption to exceed 2.5m tonnes. This level is likely to be at least maintained in 2018/19. However, these forecasts imply an increasing volume of rapeseed oil imports and are therefore vulnerable to changes in international rapeseed oil availability.
Limited supplies will keep US and Japanese demand in check
Imports of rapeseed oil into the US continue to run ahead of earlier expectations. Coupled with improved domestic output, we expect consumption to have reached a record of almost 2.7m tonnes in 2016/17. The recent application of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia could stimulate additional demand for rapeseed oil as a feedstock during the forecast period. Overall, we expect US rapeseed oil consumption to continue to grow steadily to reach 2.9m tonnes in the 2018/19 season. Several smaller consumers have switched away from rapeseed oil during 2016/17-a pattern that is likely to continue into 2017/18 as a result of its comparatively high price relative to other oils. A recovery in consumption among these "other" consumers is now expected to be delayed until 2018/19.

Supply
Global rapeseed oil production declined for the third consecutive season in 2016/17 by an estimated 2.8% year on year, to 24.7m tonnes. We now expect a further, albeit small, decline in rapeseed oil production in 2017/18. The main reduction occurs in the large number of "other" producers (including Mexico, Japan and Pakistan) who are expected to respond to higher prices of rapeseed with smaller crush volumes. Output in 2018/19 will of course depend on a recovery in rapeseed production. A return to normal yields will be the main element of any increase and would allow a significant jump in rapeseed oil output in 2018/19. We currently forecast growth of 6.2%, to 25.9m tonnes.
The EU rapeseed crop will recover only partially in 2017/18
Despite the small local crop, EU rapeseed crushers during 2016/17 managed to produce almost 10.2m tonnes of rapeseed oil, only marginally below the 2015/16 total. Prospects for rapeseed oil production in the 2017/18 season have been helped by a further increase in the size of the 2017/18 rapeseed harvest. Higher estimates for crops in France and the UK more than offset a further reduction in estimated output in Germany. Indeed, at 22.1m tonnes, the crop looks to have been well above the 2016/17 production although still shy of the record 24.3m tonnes harvested in 2014/15. Greater local availability will be needed to offset expected lower imports from Australia and a recent slowdown in imports from the Ukraine. We forecast production to show only a small increase in 2017/18 to 10.2m tonnes. Assuming a return to normal crop yields in 2018/19, we expect rapeseed oil production to approach the record output of 10.7m tonnes recorded in 2014/15.
Chinese production will fall in 2016/17
There has been a further, albeit small, reduction in the estimate of China's 2017/18 rapeseed crop. Current estimates put the 2017/18 harvest at around 5m tonnes. China's rapeseed oil production increasingly relies on imported rapeseed/canola through the additional capacity located at ports. We currently forecast 2017/18 rapeseed oil production to be only marginally higher than 2016/17, at 3.6m tonnes. Output at this level implies a significant increase in rapeseed imports which may be difficult to achieve. While rapeseed oil and rapeseed prices are likely to be higher, it remains unclear whether Chinese farmers will respond by higher plantings for the 2018/19 season. Instead, it is more likely that higher rapeseed oil production for the 2018/19 season will require yet more imports. We forecast oil output to expand to almost 4m tonnes.
Canada's 2016/17 harvest may be below expectations
At just shy of 4m tonnes, Canadian canola oil production in 2016/17 was easily a new record. Progress with the 2017/18 harvest has run ahead of normal and is virtually complete. Yields are variable in some area but are reported to have been above normal in the largest producing state of Saskatchewan. The earlier Statistics Canada report of a crop of 19.7m tonnes has been confirmed by the most recent estimate. The early harvest has made farmers ready sellers but the Canadian crush industry is facing strong competition for available supplies, especially give the low canola carry-in stocks for the 2017/18 season. We expect Canadian 2017/18 canola oil production to be little changed from the 2016/17 season at around 4m tonnes. Canola remains an attractive crop to Canadian farmers, and we assume an expansion of the planted area in 2018/19 to levels similar to the 2012/13 record. Normal yields should allow canola oil output to rise by 3.7%, to 4.2m tonnes.
India's production is poised for a rebound in 2016/17
In India, 2016/17 rapeseed crushings have been inhibited by imported vegetable oils, despite a large local harvest. Rapeseed oil production of 2.1m tonnes was well below potential output. The monsoon season just ended is recorded as normal and should, in principle, lay the foundation for at least average yields for the 2017/18 rapeseed crop. However, there is significant regional variation in the rainfall totals and the distribution of rainfall was also weighted towards the early part of the season. Estimates of the size of the 2017/18 rapeseed crop therefore err on the cautious side. However, large carry-in stocks of seed mean that 2017/18 rapeseed oil should expand to almost 2.2m tonnes.

Australian production is likely to fall in 2017/18 owing to dry conditions
Overly dry conditions have persisted in most of the main canola producing areas of Australia. For example, in Western Australia, the largest producing state, yields are expected to drop by as much as 35%, owing to the lack of rainfall. Overall, Australian production in 2017/18 is expected to reach less than 3m tonnes, well below the 4.4m tonnes harvested in 2016/17 and the lowest total since 2010/11. In Ukraine, harvesting of the winter rapeseed planted area is complete, with production confirmed at 2.1m tonnes. Winter plantings to date suggest a further increase in output in 2018/19.
Stocks and prices
The global rapeseed oil market in 2016/17 showed a deficit resulting in stocks of both rapeseed and rapeseed oil (when measured against consumption) well below normal levels. In the oil market, 2017/18 is expected to show another deficit; however, at 560,000 tonnes, this will be smaller than our previous forecast (674,000 tonnes). However, rapeseed stocks will remain available during 2017/18 and could result in higher crushings than currently expected. On the supply side of the seed market, the only major uncertainty is the size of the Indian crop to be harvested in the February-April 2018 period. Our current projections suggest that the market will remain in deficit in 2018/19, although this could be relieved to a degree by higher crush rates. In any event, global consumption may need to be further rationed from current projected levels.

Low stocks will put upward pressure on prices from late 2017
Physical prices of rapeseed oil held fairly steady in October, with price rises inhibited by weakness in the sunflowerseed oil and soybean oil markets. Futures markets for canola/rapeseed in Canada and Europe both increased during October, reflecting the growing realisation that the market will tighten during 2017/18. Sustained price rises are the most likely course for rapeseed oil prices although price gains will be limited by the high availability of other oils. However, prices look set to hover around US$900/tonne during 2018 with the potential to approach US$950/tonne in the 2019/20 season.

Rice
Demand
With human consumption of rice continuing to drive up overall use in Asia, where populations are rising, global rice usage is expected to reach a new high of 494m tonnes in 2017/18, an increase of 1.6% from the previous season. As in the past, relatively tiny volume increases are likely in other regions, such as Africa and South America. However, other segments of rice demand, such as the animal feed and industrial sectors, are anticipated to contract. The outlook for the 2018/19 season is still uncertain, since it depends on factors that will remain unknown for quite some time, such as policy frameworks, local crop outcomes and import needs. As such, our forecast for demand growth of 1.5%, to nearly 502m tonnes, assumes that annual growth will return close to trend.
Trade in rice will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2017
Africa and Asia account for three-quarters of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. With buyers in those regions expected to remain active in the global market, trade is projected to continue to grow in the next two years, to reach 44.5m tonnes in 2019, which would be the largest volume on record. However, growth will be relatively marginal, as we assume that many Asian buyers will be well stocked after having made heavy purchases in 2017. Further strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. With the bulk of that now sold, demand should fade.
China's needs are expected to be central to the rice trade in 2018-19
China is currently the world's leading buyer, with annual imports likely to be between 4.5m and 5m tonnes during the forecast period. Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines are set to be significant importers, as they aim to maintain buffer reserves. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a significant share of total demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. Shipments to Africa are likely to rise in 2017/18-2018/19, after contracting in the two previous seasons, as economic growth improves slightly and international rice prices remain low.
China is by far the world's largest consumer of rice, accounting for about 30% of global demand. The bulk of national consumption is made up of locally produced rice, but in recent years China has also become the biggest importer of rice, mainly of high-quality broken types from Thailand and Vietnam. Prices for domestic long-grain milled rice still command hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China, supporting China's import demand.
Lower duties will encourage rice imports by Bangladesh in 2018-19
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. Three domestic crops are cut each year, namely the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July) and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs are met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market. Bangladesh importers and millers have sought to get tariffs reduced as a means of boosting imports, primarily from Thailand and India, with the latter country typically the largest supplier in recent years. India has recently entered into a long-term arrangement with Vietnam for up to 1m tonnes of imports per year until 2022. Trade reports have also highlighted the possibility of significant purchases from Myanmar. The government is looking to boost rice imports in order to build reserves and rein in local prices, after flash floods hit domestic output. To this end, the tariff applied to rice imports was cut from 28% to 10% in mid-2017.
The Philippines may be a large buyer, as state reserves are historically low.
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in around a decade. In contrast, however, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain especially comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports progressed strongly over the course of the 2017, with the total for the first six months of the year at 530,000 tonnes, an 80% increase on the same period of 2016. With more imports expected throughout the rest of the year, arrivals are forecast to be 40% larger in 2017, at 1.4m tonnes. Purchases are likely to remain high in the following years.

Supply
Our forecast for world rice production in 2017/18 has been revised down further, by 3m tonnes, to 484m tonnes, representing a marginal retreat from the record outturn in 2016/17. The fall mainly reflects prospects for reduced output in India and the US. Nonetheless, this would be the second-largest crop ever harvested, with stellar outturns expected in much of Asia on the basis of area increases and better yields. The outlook for 2018/19 is highly provisional. Nonetheless, given that only a small expansion of paddy plantings is likely, an increase in global output will almost certainly be dependent on better yields. Assuming continued state support for farmers in Asia and beneficial weather, we forecast global output to increase by 1.5%, to nearly 492m tonnes, in 2018/19.
The 2017 monsoon was 5% below average, reducing output slightly
India's main agricultural crops are cultivated during two distinct seasons: kharif crops are sown between June and October and rabi crops in November-December. Kharif crops, of which rice is by far the most important, are rain-fed and therefore critically reliant on monsoon precipitation, which typically arrives in the southern state of Kerala in early June and lasts for about four months, accounting for 70% of the country's annual rains.
In India, where the kharif-planting season was completed by early October, the area planted to paddy was slightly smaller year on year, but still fairly solid compared with the average of recent seasons. The 2017 monsoon was around 5% below the long-term average; taking into account its impact on yield potential in some regions, as well as prospects for the winter-sown rabi crop, we project total acreage to be broadly steady year on year. Accordingly, we have revised down slightly our forecast for full-year output in 2017/18, by a further 500,000 tonnes, to 108m tonnes, representing a small contraction year on year. Nevertheless, this should still ensure that availabilities for domestic use and exports are sufficiently comfortable. In 2018/19, everything will depend on the pattern of the monsoon, which will begin around June 1st 2018. Tentatively assuming that it is beneficial, and that support prices are maintained at an attractive level, another above-average kharif outturn is likely.
India should remain the biggest rice exporter in 2017/18 and 2018/19
Based on their continued robust pace to date, which has been supported by large ship-ments to Africa and South Asia, India's exports are expected to reach nearly 11m tonnes in 2017, making it the largest supplier to the world market for the sixth consecutive season. Shipments in 2018 are anticipated to be slightly smaller year on year, at 10.7m tonnes. We assume that in 2019 competition from Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam, will push sales down slightly again, to 10.5m tonnes.
China's exports have expanded in 2017, mainly because of sales to Africa
Although China has emerged as the world's biggest importer of rice in recent years, it has, for the most part, been a tiny exporter. Over recent seasons its exports have fluctuated between 200,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes, with most heading to markets in Asia, including South Korea and Japan-these being part of minimum commitments to import by those nations under World Trade Organisation obligations. Shipments normally comprise mostly small- and medium-grain varieties.
Exports could surpass 1m tonnes in 2017, before receding slightly
The current year has been very different, however, with unusually large shipments of long-grain rice recorded in each month. Data from China's General Administration of Customs show that total (cumulative) exports in January-September reached around 890,000 tonnes, compared with just 239,000 tonnes in the same period of 2016, with particularly heavy deliveries to Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal and Sierra Leone. It is unclear whether such high sales can be sustained, especially since some of these shipments may have come in the form of food aid. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that China is believed to sit on massive state reserves, of at least 120m tonnes on a paddy weight basis, although much of this is unfit for human consumption. China's exports have occasionally risen above 2m tonnes, notably in 2003, with much of the increase going to Africa and the Americas. For 2017 as whole, volumes could be as large as 1.1m tonnes, but are likely to fall back in 2018 and 2019.
Production prospects for 2017/18 in Thailand are very positive
Thailand lost its place as the world's top rice exporter in 2012, owing in part to its intervention buying programme, which began in 2011, and heavy competition from India. More recently, exports have been boosted by availabilities from the government's stockpile, but prospects for production will ultimately shape the country's exportable surplus over the next two years.
In the current season (2017/18) prospects for the main crop appear solid, with harvesting due to take place in the final weeks of 2017. Cultivation is currently in the reproductive stage and progressing well. Cummulative precipitation during 2017 is estimated to be around one-quarter higher than average, and the impact of flooding in September was minimal. Good water levels will also be important during the development of the irrigated, off-season crop, which will be threshed next year. Assuming the planted area is expanded in both seasons, total production is projected at 20.4m tonnes, up from 19m tonnes in the previous year and a five-year high. A further increase in main-crop sowings is projected to push output up to 22m tonnes in 2018/19.
The government will incentivise farmers to store rice from the main harvest
In mid-September the Thai government approved a THB73bn (US$2.2bn) budget for a 2017/18 on-farm paddy pledging programme to include main-crop rice varieties from November 1st 2017 through to the end of February 2018. The scheme is aimed at supporting domestic prices during the main crop harvest, with up to 2m tonnes of paddy set to be procured. The intervention price for white rice is 3% above that of the previous season. Additional measures have been announced, with farmers, millers and traders also receiving support in the form of subsidies and soft loans, as a means of encouraging participants to store rice through to 2018.
The government's stock disposals have been successful
The Thai government has been saddled with excess reserves in recent years, an overhang of its earlier-and much-criticised-intervention buying programmes. However, considerable progress was made in disposing of this stockpile during 2017. Most government-held reserves were of questionable quality, with a large portion being sold to feed (as a substitute for corn and for imported feed wheat in swine feed rations) and industrial (ethanol) producers. However, a considerable volume of food-grade stocks has been made available to exporters at attractive prices, and these have been sold, or earmarked, for shipment to markets in Africa. This will help to sustain Thailand's exports at 10.5m tonnes in 2018, with the potential to edge higher, to 10.6m tonnes, in the following year.
Vietnam's exports, particularly to China, rose quickly in 2017
Vietnam is a medium-sized rice producer, but it is the third-largest global exporter, behind India and Thailand. It typically accounts for 5-6% of global output but 15% of exports. The Vietnam Food Association oversees policy surrounding rice export registration requirements and the setting of the country's minimum export price for grades. Vietnam's exporters have performed well in 2017, with bigger sales to a number of markets in Asia pushing up total volumes in January-October to 5.1m tonnes, up by more than 20% in year-on-year terms. Analysis of customs data show that, although exports to African nations were smaller year on year, exports to both China and the Philippines (a long-time buyer) rose markedly. However, demand has also been much firmer from Bangladesh, a country that has tended to source its import requirements from India. However, the need to build stocks after local supplies came up short pushed the government to diversify its import sources.
We expect Vietnam to export around 300,000 tonnes per month in November and December, bringing full-year exports for 2017 to 5.7m tonnes, representing a solid improvement year on year. We expect Vietnam to maintain its position as the world's third biggest exporter beyond 2019, although volumes are unlikely to exceed 7m tonnes in any season, given continued heavy sales by India and Thailand, as well as growing competition from other, relatively small exporters such as Cambodia and Myanmar.
A much smaller crop will constrain US rice exports in 2017/18
The US rice harvest was completed in October. Based on a large decrease in plantings, production in 2017/18 is expected to fall to just 5.7m tonnes, down from 7.1m tonnes in the previous season. This would be the smallest outturn in more than two decades, and is expected to tighten availabilities for sale on the international market, notwith-standing a drop in domestic use. Nevertheless, the contraction will be limited by large opening stocks. Exports in the local marketing year, which began on August 1st, are expected to fall to 3.4m tonnes, from 3.6m tonnes the previous year. US rice is sold globally, but major markets, mainly for paddy (rough rice) exports, include Central and Latin America.
A smaller crop is likely in Brazil in 2017/18 as yields retreat
Conab, the official supply agency of Brazil, released its first formal outlook for rice supply and demand in 2017/18 in early October. The southern state of Rio Grande do Sul is the most important producing region, accounting for the bulk of acreage. Together with other states, rice plantings for the 2017/18 crop, which will be harvested in the first half of 2018, was expected to hold steady compared with 2016/17, at around 2m ha. But with the agency expecting yields to fall from the previous year's level, production (paddy weight basis) is forecast to fall by 4% year on year, to 11.8m tonnes. Aside from the potential for bigger plantings in Rio Grande do Sul, there appears to be limited potential for an increase in area anywhere else in the country in the longer term. In 2018/19 production is tentatively projected to edge lower, to 11.5m tonnes.

Stocks and prices
World rice stocks are forecast to fall more appreciably in 2017/18, by almost 10m tonnes, to a seven-year low of 95.2m tonnes. Although we expect China's supportive policies for farmers to ensure another rise in inventories, this will be in contrast to falls in the major global suppliers, as well as in other countries. In Thailand, for example, the government has had much success in disposing of state reserves. Inventories held by the world's leading exporters, which also include India, Pakistan, the US and Vietnam, are forecast at 22m tonnes, down by 5m tonnes year on year. This would be the smallest amount in a decade and highlights a global market that appears to be tighter than headline figures might suggest.
Stocks are expected to drop in the next two seasons on rising consumption
In 2018/19, although world output is still expected to climb from this season's record level, rising consumption will also cut into stocks, pushing them to another multi-year low of 85m tonnes. It is assumed that stockbuilding in China will continue, especially since imports are set to remain high, but exporters' reserves may fall again, to just 21m tonnes, most of which will be held in India.

Following significant, demand-driven price increases in earlier months, markets in Asia have generally eased since mid-2017, although the past two months have shown contrasting trends. In Thailand, offers for the 100% B grade fell by around 2% over the past month, to US$381/tonne fob Bangkok on November 2nd, as sluggish international demand and the approach of new crop supplies weighed on sentiment. In India, the same factors affected markets in October.
However, export values in Pakistan were slightly firmer as supplies from the previous crop tightened ahead of the arrival of the main crop harvest in late 2017. Broken rice markets in Vietnam firmed by 4% over the past month on strong underlying demand-illustrated by the 20% year-on-year jump in exports in January-October 2017. US milled rice export prices remain high, despite a slight fall month on month as this year's heavy drop in production has boosted sentiment. The 4% broken variety traded at US$514/tonne in early November, down by 1% on four weeks earlier, but well above the US$400/tonne level seen in April and 29% higher compared with the same point of 2016.
The price outlook for Thailand's 100% B grade rice-the series that we forecast-has been revised down slightly, although market fundamentals are unchanged. Given recent weakness, we now expect prices to average US$385/tonne in the fourth quarter of 2017 (US$395/tonne previously), translating into a full-year average price of US$388/tonne, just slightly above the 2016 average. Our supply and demand forecasts suggest that there is potential for some upward pressure on prices as global supplies begin to tighten in 2018 owing to contractions in major exporters. By the fourth quarter of 2019 we forecast a price of US$425/tonne; however, although this would equate to a five-year high, it would still be well below the levels seen in 2009-13. Another gentle rise, to US$430/tonne, is likely in the first quarter of 2020.

Soybeans
Demand
As increases in demand in China and many other Asian nations boost demand for feed ingredients, including high-protein oilseed meals, consumption is forecast to expand by 4.3% in 2017/18, reaching a new high of 339m tonnes. Although we expect growth to slow relative to that in 2016/17, it will match the average of recent seasons. Looking beyond Asia, other, smaller consuming regions, including the EU, Africa and the Middle East, will also contribute to rising demand. Prospects for 2018/19 are unclear, as crop outcomes will not be known for another 12-18 months. However, we expect rising usage in the animal feed sector to support similar demand growth that season, of 4.4%, to reach a record 354m tonnes.
World soybean trade in 2017/18 is forecast to rise for the seventh consecutive year, to a record of 148.7m tonnes, with most of the expansion due to rising needs in China, as well as smaller markets in Asia. With demand from these countries provisionally expected to increase, traded volumes could surpass 153m tonnes in 2018/19.
Feed usage will drive overall demand up and will mostly be met by imports
China is by far the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans, with growth largely driven by expanding demand from the country's vast animal feed sector. In 2017/18 we expect China's total consumption to reach a new record of 105m tonnes, representing impressive growth of about 6% and approaching one-third of the amount used globally. Imports are forecast to total 95.5m tonnes, or more than 90% of consumption, which highlights the global market's dependence on Chinese processors. Although the government is looking to boost local output, it seems that imports will continue to account for a dominant, and possibly rising, share of overall requirements, especially in feed sectors. Most of what is produced locally is likely to be channelled to food and other smaller markets.
China's imports in 2018/19 are expected to reach 100m tonnes
Despite reports of large stocks of soybeans and associated pressure on crush margins, import demand growth has remained robust throughout 2017, with buyers encouraged by a world market that is amply supplied and attractively priced. The outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, but China's full-season purchases are likely to reach 100m tonnes.
Nonetheless, the Chinese government's intention to end maize stockpiling, announced in 2016, remains a downside risk. The move aims to encourage the use of maize at the expense of other feed grains, which have been imported in great quantities in recent years. Higher maize consumption in the pork and poultry sectors could also raise questions surrounding the use of high-protein meals, primarily soybean meal. The impact, however, is likely to be marginal, as soybean meal is the most abundantly produced of all oilseed meals, with its attractiveness as a feed ingredient stemming from its high-protein quality and nutritional value compared with alternatives.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
With another bumper crop expected to result in a further swelling of domestic supplies, US consumption in 2017/18 is forecast to remain close to the previous season's high, at 56m tonnes. Aside from requirements locally, total use will be underpinned by rising exports of soybean meal. Similar trends will enable domestic demand potentially to edge up in 2018/19, to 57m tonnes.
Soybean consumption in Argentina will continue to be driven by growing international demand for soybean meal, of which Argentina is the dominant supplier to world markets. In Brazil, further increases in consumption are anticipated as bigger local soybean crops boost supplies for processing.
Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successively larger record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes, domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall requirements, with imports of soybeans and soybean meal typically accounting for anything up to 35m tonnes. In 2017/18 imports of soybeans are likely to rise after the previous season's fall, but any increase is likely to be capped by a much better local rapeseed harvest, estimated at 22m tonnes, up from 20.4m tonnes in the preceding season. In 2018/19 and beyond, availabilities of alternatives, including rapeseed, will play a crucial role in determining volume requirements. Throughout the period we expect the region's soybean meal imports to remain above 20m tonnes, making it easily the world's largest buyer.

Supply
Although planting campaigns in Latin America's leading producers are now under way, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about prospects for the global outturn in 2017/18. Never-theless, in the northern hemisphere another season of big or record crops is expected, judging by completed plantings and intentions, and early field reports. We expect these factors to support the second-largest harvest ever.
A solid increase in the global area for harvesting is expected, but yields are likely to be slightly below the record achieved in 2016/17. Accordingly, production is forecast to fall by 1.6% year on year, to 341m tonnes. In the following season output could recover slightly, but would still fall a little short of the 2016/17 high: our projection of a 1% year-on-year increase, to 344.7m tonnes, reflects our assumption of a slight rise in sowings and trend yields.
US production in 2017/18 is likely to set a new record owing to a larger area
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects seeded area in 2017/18 to increase by around 7% year on year, to 36.2m ha, the largest on record. In addition to a switch of acreage from maize and spring wheat, expanded area also stems from a steep contraction in winter wheat sowings. Weather patterns during the current growing season were a cause for concern at times in parts of the Midwest, including dry and hot conditions in the east and in the northern Plains, with excessive rains being a problem in eastern regions. It therefore seems likely that average yields will not match those of the previous year. Nonetheless, local official projections and recent field reports reflect a positive yield outlook.
At a record of 120m tonnes, output is expected to be almost 3% higher year on year in 2018/19 (compared with a marginal decrease previously). Together with high carryover stocks from the season before (which ends on August 31st), a crop of that size will ensure ample supplies for domestic use and export. We assume that recent delays to harvesting in parts of the Midwest will not have a detrimental impact.
US exports could establish a new record in 2017/18
US exports progressed strongly during the 2016/17 season, totalling 58.1m tonnes by August 31st 2017 (the close of the US marketing year), up by 4m tonnes from 2015/16. The solid pace was shaped by international demand from Asia, but by also a range of other, relatively small importers, including those in Africa and the Middle East. For 2017/18 we expect shipments to expand to at least 60m tonnes, a new record. Although the pace of sales has stepped up significantly in recent weeks, they remain well behind a year earlier. On October 26th cumulative export sales had exceeded 30m tonnes, although this was still a drop of about 16% year on year. The slower pace is almost certainly linked to heavy shipments by Brazil, with some buyers hesitant to enter the world market, preferring to wait for the bulk of northern hemisphere supplies to come on stream at attractive prices.
US growers are expected to reduce the area planted to soybeans in 2018/19
Planting intentions for 2018/19 in the northern hemisphere are tentative at this stage. In the US much will depend on relative prices at the time of planting, as well as crop rotation. Although there is an argument in favour of increased corn plantings at the expense of soybeans following 2017/18 seeding patterns, support for soybean acreage could come from the continued expansion of global trade, driven largely by China's needs. We anticipate that the area planted to soybeans in the US will fall by between 2% and 3% in 2018/19. Combined with yields, the outturn is projected at 114m tonnes, which is 5% lower than the previous season, but still the third-largest harvest on record.
A huge crop will be cut in Canada, with further increases likely in the long term
The area for harvest in Canada is estimated at a record of 2.9m ha, an unprecedented year-on-year expansion of 33%, driven by expanded acreage in the non-traditional growing areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, largely at the expense of wheat and canola. One of the key attractions is that Canadian growers are able to tap in to a fast-growing global market. Added to this, the crop requires less intensive application of inputs, such as fertilisers, compared with alternatives, and new varieties have been developed that can be cultivated in areas that were previously unsuitable. Despite the significant expansion of seeded area, some reduction in yields is expected, especially as earlier reports from Manitoba and Saskatchewan pointed to difficulties with crop development owing to challenging weather. According to Canada's Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, output is expected to increase by 1.5m tonnes to 8m tonnes in 2017/18. Exports are projected to rise to 5.6m tonnes, up from 4.4m tonnes in the previous season.
Brazil's exports are likely to smash previous records in 2017/18
Brazil's huge 2016/17 crop boosted availabilities to record levels and, given expected growth in trade, positioned Brazil to export significantly larger volumes in the local marketing year (which closes at end-January 2018). We have kept our forecast steady from last month's assessment. We believe that total shipments could reach a record of at least 62m tonnes, up by 14% from the previous year. With prospects for a marked rise in domestic prices in Brazil appearing limited given current conditions, farmers are likely to finish the season with larger than normal stocks. Furthermore, with another big US crop anticipated and availabilities coming on stream imminently, there is the potential for significant supplies in late 2017 and early 2018, and associated downward pressure on prices.
Growth in sowings in Brazil is expected in 2017/18, but may be limited by low prices
With plenty of land available, a further expansion of soybean area in Brazil is possible in 2017/18, and we are projecting growth of 2%, to 34.5m ha. Nevertheless, downside risks remain; current market conditions, including low domestic and soybean prices, coupled with exchange-rate uncertainty, will make it hard for many growers to cover production costs. Much will depend on the US harvest and its impact on the global market.
It seems likely that, despite the area increase, some growers will be tempted to scale back expenditure on essential inputs to minimise overall costs. Nevertheless, maize prices in Brazil are signficantly below year-earlier levels-having fallen by a larger margin than soybean prices did-which makes it likely that some farmers will have switched a portion of their intended primary, or full-season, maize cropland to soybeans. Planting of the 2017/18 soybean crop began on September 11th in the state of Paraná-a few days earlier than normal-as part of a government experiment to see if early fieldwork is viable. Other states, including the major producing region of Mato Grosso, followed shortly after.
The planting season is being hampered by difficult weather
Planting has been stalled by difficult conditions, with soils deemed to be too dry for seeding to advance in many areas, while being excessively wet in southern regions. With dry conditions likely to persist in the worst affected areas, some growers are understood to be considering re-sowing fields. Further highlighting difficult conditions, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics put planting at 44% complete by the end of October, down from 67% a year earlier.
However, local analysts and commentators still believe that a good crop can be expected, even if seeding does not begin until November, assuming that weather patterns are favourable. However, if conditions do not improve significantly, some farmers could be tempted not to plant a late soybean crop and instead focus on other options, including full-season cotton, prices for which are likely to be favourable.
Finally, it is worth noting again that the Brazilian National Meteorological Institute (Inmet) has released its forecast for the final quarter of 2017, which highlights the risk that a La Niña weather event will form. Many farmers in Brazil are already concerned about the potentially slow start to the season, so the potential of a mild La Niña-which typically brings below-normal rainfall for east-central and south-eastern Brazil-has added to their concerns. We expect no more than a mild effect on Brazilian output were such an event to occur.
With yields unlikely to be near those achieved in 2016/17, we forecast output to fall slightly in 2017/18, by 5% year on year, to 108m tonnes. Planting of the 2018/19 crop will not begin until mid-September 2018, so the outlook is highly provisional. Based on some further area expansion and trend productivity, output could be close to the 2016/17 high.
Production in Argentina could fall in 2017/18 on potential area declines
Fieldwork for Argentina's 2017/18 crop is now under way. Most of the progress has been in the north, although planting should speed up after farmers have made solid progress with the maize crop. After heavy rains, a period of dry weather is needed to ensure that soils are in good shape. However, as with Brazil, seeding decisions will depend on market conditions at the time of planting. With relatively better returns for maize, growers are expected to favour plantings of the grain over soybeans. With some area reduction likely, and together with a fall in average yields, production is projected to drop by 3.5m tonnes year on year, to 53m tonnes. Although the government is expected to reduce soybean export levies gradually over the course of 2018-19, the crop will still not be as an attractive as other options.

China's output is rising, but still only meets a fraction of domestic demand
Despite being by far the world's largest importer, China is only a minor producer of soybeans. Its potential has been capped by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players, as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, corn and rice. Nonetheless, in August 2016 the Chinese authorities published a National Oilseed Development Plan, which aims to boost domestic production to 60m tonnes by 2020. The scheme will provide support for oilseed production, processing, technical extension and innovation.
In 2016/17 total acreage was up by an estimated 10% from the previous season, and a further increase is likely in 2017/18, with a portion of land coming from the switching out of corn production in north-eastern areas. Total output in that season is expected to rise to a peak of 14.3m tonnes, up from 13.1m tonnes in the previous year, and the same influences will underpin another increase in output to 15.2m tonnes in 2018/19.
Stocks and prices
Following the exceptionally sharp increases of recent years, global stocks are projected to increase by only a modest amount in 2017/18. Although production is likely to fall in that season, linked to smaller crops in Latin America, large carryover inventories will compensate in the face of another strong rise in consumption. At 120.7m tonnes, global reserves are forecast to be around 2m tonnes larger than in the previous season, although this would be substantially above the five-year average.
Looking below the top-line numbers, US ending stocks on August 31st 2018 are projected to be significantly bigger on a year-on-year basis, although this contrasts with potential falls in Argentina and Brazil. China may also see some destocking following recent years of heavy imports.

Although this market outlook suggests little scope for a price recovery in 2017/18, the supply and demand fundamentals assume that conditions for crop development are favourable in most countries. Should crops falter in any of the main producers, the balance sheet could be significantly tighter and may fuel an increase in prices. Nevertheless, based on our current projections, we see a drop in inventories of a little over 9m tonnes in 2018/19. This is significant, as it would be the first annual contraction in carryovers in seven seasons.
Export quotations (Gulf basis) in the US were moderately firmer in the four weeks to November 2nd, rising by 2% to US$381/tonne, although increases in Chicago futures were more pronounced, at more than 3% over the month. Reports of delays to fieldwork in Brazil have also supported prices, as has stronger international demand for US new crop supplies.
Given that US futures and export prices have moved in a narrow range over the past month, and with few changes to the broader fundamental picture, our forecasts for prices are unchanged. We expect prices to contract slightly in the final quarter of 2017, pushing the full-year average price down by around 3% compared with 2016, to US$377/tonne fob. On the basis of our forecast for a modest rise in global stocks, the potential for price gains in 2018 is very limited. We forecast price growth to be fairly marginal, at 1.2% that year, before climbing more quickly, by 3%, in 2019 as global stocks dip slightly.
However, our production outlook rests on the assumption of normal growing conditions across the full season in leading producing countries. Should crops fall significantly short of expectations in any of the main exporters, especially in Brazil in the early stages of 2018, there could be significant market support, pushing prices well above projected levels.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand by an average of 1.2% in 2017/18-2018/19 (October-September), roughly in line with the average over the past four seasons. Rising demand will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are gradually adopting the food-and-drink habits of developed-world countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift, as a sweetener in food and beverages, and as a binding and preserving agent in processed foods. However, a modest slowdown in economic growth in emerging markets (particularly in Asia) will dampen the pace of consumption growth in the coming years. Moreover, heightened awareness about the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put pressure on consumption growth. Amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products, a gradual shift towards synthetic sweeteners will somewhat lessen demand for sugar. Moreover, owing to the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market was liberalised in September 2017), these cheaper alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of relatively low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies in many developed countries and protectionist moves in several emerging markets, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
Slower GDP growth in China will weigh on sugar demand
Sugar consumption in China is low, at around 11 kg per head compared with an average of 24 kg in developed countries, leaving considerable room for growth. Changing consumer tastes and rising urbanisation will continue to spur demand. However, we expect the pace of consumption growth to moderate as slower economic growth dampens investment and weighs on income growth. This will be compounded by the growing supply of starch-based sweetener, which is a cheaper rival to sugar in the beverages industry, and higher domestic sugar prices, which are a likely consequence of the government's recent move to restrict imports. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government has reduced permits (to 1m tonnes, roughly half the previous level) and raised duties (from 50% to 95%) on out-of-quota sugar imports. These measures have led to a sharp drop in imports, which fell by around 30% year on year in the first nine months of 2017. A sharp rebound in imports is unlikely under the new tariff regime. However, we doubt that China will be able to scale up domestic production in 2017/18-2018/19 to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high level of stocks. It is therefore expected to remain a fairly significant player in the global market.
Consumption in India is forecast to recover as prices normalise
Potential consumption growth in India was constrained in 2015/16 by high post-drought prices and unsupportive policy moves (including demonetisation and the removal of some consumer subsidies). We expect demand to recover somewhat in the coming years as domestic supply improves. The government has come under pressure from industry stakeholders to protect the local industry from a flood of imports, as low global sugar prices and a strong rupee left domestic producers struggling to compete. In response, it has made only modest purchases over the course of the year and raised import duties from 40% to 50% in mid-2017. However, the near-term impact of higher tariffs will be muted by the strong local harvest; as large domestic supplies from the 2017/18 crop hit the market, domestic prices will soften. This, together with rising incomes, will support demand.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is positive. Some of the more developed countries, such as Malaysia and South Korea, are likely to grow only slowly as markets mature, but this will be more than offset by populous developing countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. However, demand growth in this region will be somewhat dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry to cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer) increases production and seeks export markets. Tax measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines could also dampen demand, with Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia pursuing plans to introduce a so-called sugar tax. This has the potential to put a sharp brake on demand; for example, the introduction of a sugar tax in Mexico in 2015 has contributed to a 12% drop in sugar demand since then. Nevertheless, we assume that any such policies in Asia will be rolled out only slowly over the coming years, amid concerns over restricting growth in the otherwise burgeoning food and drink manufacturing industries.
Health warnings may eventually dent sugar demand in the developed world
Demand growth in the mature EU market is likely to be sluggish in 2017/18-2018/19. Many EU countries already average far higher consumption levels of sugar than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), much of which is hidden in processed foods, and the EU Consumer Organisation is urging the food industry to take notice of WHO guidelines. So far, tax measures have been proposed to curb use in countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium. The policy response is likely to be watered down somewhat by opposition from the powerful food and drink industry, but consumer pressure will lead to a gradual shift in the food industry toward lower sugar levels. More imminently, however, the liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farmgate prices and export caps were abolished-will limit the need for imports and bring European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. This should support sugar consumption. However, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based sweetener) was also liberalised in September 2017 and, as in the US, this is likely to steal market share gradually from sugar over the medium term. As well as the adjustment to the new liberalised regime, the UK's exit from the EU is generating uncertainty in the European sugar industry, as the UK is the largest importer of EU sugar.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase, with the bulk of growth coming from expanding indigenous supplies that make sugar more affordable. Several consumers (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. But inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. Health warnings could temper the pace of consumption growth, with a sugar tax being considered in South Africa. However, as in EU countries, this is meeting resistance from its food and beverage industries, and a widespread roll-out on the sin tax across the continent seems unlikely. Overall, changing consumer tastes and population growth will drive average demand growth of 2.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19.
Policy changes will shift the dynamics of the global sugar trade
The overhaul of EU sugar policy in 2017 is likely to have a significant effect on global trade patterns as the bloc transitions from being a net importer to becoming a net exporter. We expect this transition to be complete by the end of the 2017/18 season. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hardest hit by this shift. Global trade dynamics will also be affected by the introduction of heavy import tariffs in China, with small producers (exempt from the new tariffs) likely to increase their market share. Trade patterns in Asia will also be affected by the liberalisation of sugar sales under Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which comes into effect in 2018. This will probably cause less efficient producers (such as Vietnam) to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade is also likely to increase in North America, following a trade deal between the US and Mexico that came into effect in July. This tightened up the rules for Mexican producers and granted Mexico the right of first refusal for the US's above-quota import demand.
These trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by countries' preference for holding strategic stockpiles of sugar to hedge against future shocks. We therefore expect trade to increase in 2017/18 as countries (notably China) rebuild stocks after several years of low domestic production and relatively high global prices, before trade flows slow in 2018/19 on the back of large local harvests in markets that typically swing between net imports and net exports (notably India).

Supply
After fairly modest growth of 2.1% in 2016/17, and shrinking global supply in the two previous years, world sugar production is forecast to increase by 6.8% in 2017/18, to 179.2m tonnes. Global supply will be supported by strong crop revivals in India and Thailand, following weather-related shocks during the previous harvest, and strong output growth in the EU as producers seek to capitalise on the newly liberalised sugar regime. The world's largest producer, Brazil, will benefit from a second consecutive year of crop-friendly growing conditions in 2017/18 and, with a significant amount of output locked into generously priced forward contracts, the supply of cane to sugar production is likely to remain above historical levels. In 2018/19 we expect global production to remain fairly flat, at 179.3m tonnes, with a slowdown in output from Brazil largely offset by production growth in India and the EU. Our forecast is contingent on normal weather conditions, and even fairly modest disruptions to rainfall patterns pose significant upside or downside risks.
Output growth in Brazil is in prospect as cane supply increases
Brazil is on course for a strong cane harvest, with volumes surpassing market expectations in the early months of the local 2017/18 season (April-March) and quality deteriorating only slightly as the harvest has progressed. With cane supply robust, the main factor shaping Brazil's sugar output will be the supply of cane for sugar vis-à-vis ethanol production. The government reduced a federal ethanol tax in late July, which has the potential to boost ethanol demand and therefore to prompt crushers to divert cane to the fuel industry. With sugar and ethanol prices now hovering around parity, mills are shifting back to ethanol production after several months of favouring sugar. Only 43.8% was used for sugar production in the first half of October, which is in line with the historical average of 44%, but down from above 50% in the first half of 2017. Nevertheless, a significant volume of cane was locked into sugar contracts at a time of higher global prices, and the overall production mix for the 2017/18 local season will probably favour sugar. In 2018/19 the weakness of the Real will support the attractiveness of the export-oriented sugar industry, while only marginal growth in global oil prices will sap demand for biofuels. We expect ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil to remain around parity, which is likely to keep the division of cane in line with historical norms. However, sugar cane fields are ageing and field renewal rates are low. This will begin to take a toll on cane output from 2018/19, thereby reducing the overall cane crush. Sugar production is therefore forecast to moderate to 38.6m tonnes in 2018/19, from 39.6m tonnes in 2017/18.
Strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
Production in India is poised for a strong recovery following drought-related supply disruptions in 2015/16-2016/17. We expect output to reach 26m tonnes in 2017/18 as growth is supported by stronger yields and an expansion of the crop area under cultivation. The strong harvest is expected despite a slightly sub-average monsoon season in some areas, with farmers' improved resilience to weather dynamics a result of new seed varieties and an expansion of drip irrigation technology. Industry officials in India anticipate another year of strong supply growth in 2018/19, with some forecasts as high as 30m tonnes. A robust harvest in the previous year will, however, weigh on domestic prices, and we think this will somewhat temper appetite in the industry to scale up production. Nevertheless, with higher farmgate prices incentivising farmers to increase cane acreage, and rainfall conditions assumed to be normal, decent cane supply will sustain high levels of sugar production in 2018/19.
EU production will recover as the sugar regime is liberalised
In Europe, sugar output is poised for brisk growth as producers seek to take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system. Under the new regime, which came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 season, producers (led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries) will extend their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity without significant additional investments. Extended crush seasons will be supported by higher supply of beet, with some integrated sugar companies reporting that the area under cultivation has been increased by some 15% year on year in 2017/18. Favourable weather conditions are also supporting the beet crop, with the authorities in France projecting a record high harvest in 2017/18. We expect EU production to reach 18.8m tonnes in 2018/19, which will surpass EU demand and spur export growth. Higher supply and greater efficiency should leave the region's main producers able to withstand lower prices as the price of European sugar falls closer to the global average.
In Russia, sugar production is expected to remain robust, following the significant investment in the modernisation of sugar factories in recent years. The ensuing surplus will support Russia's emergence as a notable exporter as the government seeks to prevent stock build-ups from depressing domestic prices and deterring planting. However, we think that the authorities' forecast that exports will reach almost 1m t/y is overoptimistic, owing to soft demand for imports in Central Asia (Russia's main market) and the country's limited output of high-value sugar (which is in higher demand globally).
Output in Thailand is recovering from El Niño's long reach
In Thailand, favourable rainfall patterns will support a bumper harvest in 2017/18 of 11.9m tonnes. Assuming that rainfall normalises in 2018/19, we forecast a more moderate, albeit still decent, output of 10.5m tonnes. We have increased this forecast slightly, on the expectation that producers will also be incentivised by export opportunities to other Asian markets, where demand is rising and Thai sugar enjoys favourable access under the ASEAN free-trade arrangement. Following a challenge by Brazil, which argued that Thailand was violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free competition, the Thai government has agreed to remove production subsidies in December 2017. This will inflate costs, but we do not expect it to erode the country's competitiveness entirely. Increasing mechanis-ation will help to boost yields, and the sugar cane area in Thailand will continue to expand as farmers turn away from less profitable rice crops. However, the sugar industry's exposure to weather-related shocks is gradually increasing as production moves towards the more drought-prone interior regions. This signals that the risks to our Thai production forecasts are increasing.
A major recovery in China's sugar sector appears unlikely for now
China's sugar output has fallen sharply in recent years, owing to unfavourable weather and the impact of rapidly rising costs for labour, land and farm machinery. Amid political pressure from the local industry, some government support has been forthcoming in the form of input subsidies and soft loans, and the government has raised duties on out-of-quota sugar imports in a bid to protect local producers from cheaper imports. These measures will support the profitability of the local industry and should spur some investment, but we doubt that they will lead to a significant surge in domestic supply growth. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high and sugar cane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. Indeed, the cost of producing sugar cane in China is almost double that in Thailand, and this will deter investment. The government is attempting to encourage consolidation among the many disparate industry players in the country's main sugar region of Guangxi in an attempt to improve its competitiveness. However, similar moves in the past, for example in the soy market, have not yielded impressive results, and high local prices will probably allow some small, inefficient players to remain in the market. We do not, therefore, expect output to rise by the 10% per year that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals. However, given more favourable growing conditions (compared at least with the El Niño-linked dry conditions of 2015/16-2016/17), we expect output to rise to an average of 10.4m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19.

Stocks and prices
After successive supply deficits and a period of relatively high global prices, global sugar stocks shrank to 87.4m tonnes at end-2016/17. We expect the stocks to recover to 96.5m tonnes at end-2018/19 as the market swings back into surplus. The market surplus is forecast to reach 5.7m tonnes in 2017/18, amid bumper harvests from key producers and lacklustre demand growth, before moderating to 3.4m tonnes in 2018/19 as output remains flat and consumption accelerates slightly. Although overall stocks will remain comfortable (equivalent to an average of 54.3% of annual consumption in 2017/18-2018/19), the uneven distribution of these stocks means that reserves will not always be available to the market, and occasional supply squeezes are possible.

The latest sugar price rally has peaked
After peaking at over 23 US cents/lb in late 2016, global sugar prices fell by 30% over the first half of 2017, before stabilising in the third quarter, at 14.5 US cents/lb. In part, this reflects a market correction after overshooting in late 2016, with speculative investors unwinding the long positions that they had adopted during the price boom. More fundamentally, crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets are fuelling expectations of a global sugar surplus in the coming years, and policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably, China, India and Europe) have further weakened market sentiment. Amid oversupply in the global market, we expect prices to average 16 US cent/lb in 2017, down by 11% on the previous year.
Beyond 2017, we expect prices to drift higher, to between 15.5 US cents/lb and 16.5 US cents/lb in 2018-19. This modest price recovery from the nadir of mid-2017 will be driven largely by market tightening from 2018 as the crucial Brazilian market diverts more cane to ethanol production over the coming years and therefore produces less sugar. A swing to ethanol that is substantial enough to bring the global sugar market into balance seems unlikely, however, and the prospects of global oversupply will probably prevent a more significant rebound to prices. Nonetheless, expectations of global surpluses are based on the assumptions of normal weather conditions in all producing countries and there therefore remains a risk of sharp supply shocks if crop conditions change. The sugar trading market is seemingly pricing in little risk at the moment, but, as the marker tightens in 2018/19, we think that this will change. Higher risk premiums will therefore probably provide some support to prices in 2019.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
The 2016/17 season has seen a remarkable 15% increase in global sunflowerseed oil consumption. The Economist Intelligence Unit has nudged up its estimate for sunflowerseed oil consumption in 2016/17 slightly, to 18.2m tonnes (18.1m tonnes previously). This growth reflects the substantial discounts of sunflower-seed oil to other oils. These discounts continue to be large, and early signs point towards sustained growth from this high base in 2017/18. However, there is a risk that insufficient availability will weigh on demand growth that season. We currently expect global consumption to increase by a more modest 2.7% in 2017/18, to 18.7m tonnes. Consumption is likely to exceed 19m tonnes in 2018/19, although this relies on sunflowerseed oil maintaining its competitive position against other oils.
Sunflowerseed oil's improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
EU consumption of sunflowerseed oil in 2016/17 continues to surprise. The most recent data suggests that consumption reached almost 4.5m tonnes. Given the increasing discounts to rapeseed and soybean oils, consumption in the 2017/18 season is getting off to a good start. At this stage, we are forecasting a slight rise in EU consumption to just over 4.5m tonnes. Despite the higher local availabillty, this consumption total will continue to rely on sizeable imports of sunflowerseed oil. The recent reductions in likely ouput in Russia and the Ukraine pose a risk to this forecast. Given its favourable consumer image, demand should continue to grow in 2018/19 provided there is adequate availability.
Russian consumption will rise modestly as the economy emerges from recession
In Russia, higher local availability of sunflowerseed oil encouraged increased local consumption. We have maintained our estimate for Russian sunflower-seed oil consumption of 2.5m tonnes in 2016/17, reflecting robust growth of 8.5%. We expect local availability to tighten slightly in 2017/18, which may be reflected in local prices; however, we expect supply to remain comfortable enough to support continued demand growth, of 1.6%. In addition, this forecast remains contingent on Russia's continued economic recovery, with any setback in overall growth likely to weigh on consumption. In 2018/19 we expect demand growth to be sustained, at 3.7%, assuming good local availability.
Robust GDP growth and shifting preferences will boost India's usage
Indian imports of sunflowerseed have continued to run at high levels in the third quarter of 2017. We estimate that Indian consumption rose by nearly 33% that season, to 2.2m tonnes; this will boost stocks at the start of 2017/18, supporting continued demand growth that season. The growing consumer preference for sunflowerseed oil, especially in the south of India, and sustained economic growth should also be positive for demand although the recent increase in import duties on vegetable oils (including sunflowerseed oil) will, to a degree, constrain the growth rate. We think that 2017/18 consumption could exceed 2.3m tonnes with further growth in 2018/19.
Turkish consumption will increase in 2017/18-2018/19
Many countries have been increasing their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Supplies are likely to remain comfortable throughout the forecast period, which will continue this trend. Countries increasing their use of sunflowerseed oil include Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, as well as several smaller countries. Growth in consumption in these "other" countries will moderate in 2017/18, following a robust performance in 2016/17.

Supply
Global sunflowerseed oil production in 2016/17 rose by an estimated 15.4% to 18.4m tonnes, by far the highest level on record by far. The outlook for the 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop is mixed. The most recent estimates indicate that output in Russia and the Ukraine will not meet earlier expectations. This is partially offset by a higher estimate for the EU, but overall the likely global harvest will be smaller than previously forecast. Nonetheless, it remains a large crop by recent standards. In 2017/18 sunflowerseed oil output could approach the previous season's record; however, this relies on a reduction in sunflowerseed stocks and may turn out to be too optimistic. Our tentative projections suggest sufficient seed availability in 2018/19 to rebuild stocks and allow for an expansion of sunflowerseed oil output, to 18.8m tonnes.
Ukraine's 2016/17 sunflowerseed harvest exceeds our expectations
We estimate that Ukrainian sunflowerseed oil output jumped by over 25% in 2016/17, to a total of 6.3m tonnes. Harvesting of the 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop is in its final phase, and yields from the later harvested area have been disappointing. This has prompted a further reduction in our harvest estimate to 13.5m tonnes. However, with relatively plentiful sunflowerseed stocks carried over, this is not likely to have an immediate impact on crush rates; however, for the season as a whole, crushing will be lower in year-on-year terms. We forecast sunflowerseed oil production to fall to just below 6m tonnes in 2017/18. Local analysts suggest that both the harvest and sunflowerseed oil could turn out even lower than this. Although the 2018/19 outlook is still provisional, the industry's strong expansion in recent years should ensure ample seed availability despite concerns about crop rotations. We expect output in 2018/19 to rise to nearly 6.2m tonnes, slightly lower than the record outturn in 2016/17.
Sunflowerseed will remain a popular crop in Russia
In Russia, sunflowerseed crushing has also been running at high levels, and the 2016/17 outturn is likely to reach 4.5m tonnes, up by 15.2% year on year. Harvest prospects have also been downgraded here, reflecting both a lower planted area and signficantly lower yields than previously expected. Our current estimate is for a crop of 11.4m tonnes, although some local estimates are as low as 11m tonnes. With more than sufficient crush capacity in Russia, output tends to be limited by market availability for the oil. We forecast a modest rise in sunflowerseed oil output, to almost 4.6m tonnes in 2017/18. Export availability of sunflowerseed will be only around half of that recorded in 2016/17.
Estimates for the EU 2016/17 sunflowerseed harvest have improved
The production of sunflowerseed oil in the EU looks to have set a new record at just over 3.2m tonnes. A large local crop and good demand following the shortfall in rapeseed supplies underpin this new level. The more optimistic outlook for the 2017/18 sunflowerseed harvest has been maintained on account of higher estimates for Spain and France. We have increased our harvest estimate to 8.7m tonnes (8.5m tonnes previously). Better availability will allow higher levels of crushing, and we have increased our forecast for 2017/18 sunflowerseed oil output to 3.3m tonnes (3.2m tonnes previously).
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain good, but downside risks are mounting
In Argentina, we maintain our estimate that 2016/17 sunflowerseed oil production has reached 1.3m tonnes. We expect that the sunflowerseed area will expand for the 2017/18 season. Sowings got off to a good start, although wet conditions have hampered later plantings. We have made a small reduction to our estimate of sunflowerseed production to reflect the likely loss in area although the output will still be significantly higher than the 2016/17 harvest. Despite the lower harvest estimate, we still expect that sunflowerseed oil production will exceed 1.4m tonnes in both 2017/18 and 2018/19. Export availability of sunflowerseed in 2017/18 will also be higher than 2016/17 even with the reduced crop estimate.

Stocks and prices
At the end of the 2016/17 season, sunflowerseed oil stocks were ample both in absolute terms and relative to consumption. Sunflowerseed stocks fell during 2016/17 and ended the season below average levels. We expect the market to register a deficit in 2017/18 especially following the reductions in expected output recorded in this issue. Sunflowerseed oil stocks look likely to fall below normal levels. However, even this outcome assumes a significant drawdown of sunflowerseed stocks, to low levels. Indeed, the tightening of sunflowerseed stocks may be sufficient to cause a reduction in sunflowerseed crushing from the levels currently forecast. Even allowing for a normal production season in 2018/19, sunflowerseed oil stocks are likely to remain tight.

Upward pressure on prices will be felt in the coming months
Sunflowerseed oil prices eased in October under pressure from high levels of production. With the global market deficit set to widen in 2017/18, prices should start to edge up over the coming months. We expect this upward trend to persist into the 2018/19 season. The strength of rapeseed prices should also be positive for sunflowerseed oil values. Price rises are likely to be comparatively small but persistent, bringing average prices up to almost US$1,000 by the end of the 2018/19 season.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for one-third of world tea consumption and is consuming ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is also growing in other major consuming regions, including India and the US. Demand for tea is less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities, reflecting its low cost, meaning that tea demand will be driven primarily by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast rates for tea consumption growth, of 3.8% a year on average in 2018-19, are relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since tea consumption is determined by structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages. Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and "ready to drink" tea beverages account for a small share of the tea market but have enjoyed rapid growth in sales-even in traditional markets such as China-which will also contribute to demand growth.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption. In producing countries, tea will benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places will remain a consumer staple, despite a steady increase in consumption of other beverages, including coffee. Combined with favourable demographics, consumption growth in producing countries should rise further. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partially to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2017-18
Tea consumption is dominated by Asia, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2017, up from 48% in 2010. In China, we expect the government's efforts to rein in credit growth to contribute to an economic slowdown from 2018, but this will have only a muted impact on tea consumption growth, which is expected to rise by 4% per year, compared with 5% in 2017. Nonetheless, demand will remain strong compared with many other markets, helping to underpin continued firm global tea consumption growth. Moreover, this forecast is relatively cautious, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projecting average annual Chinese demand growth of 15% until 2024, suggesting an upside risk to our forecasts. Average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China just 14th in the world. This leaves significant room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drink tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Other changes in consumer habits will also affect tea sales, with greater demand for teabags globally (these are less wasteful than loose-leaf tea). However, given the importance attached to the quality of tea, sales of leaf teas will continue to dominate the local market.
In India, strong economic growth will be accompanied by higher household spending and firm consumer confidence, which will support annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2018-19, marginally lower than estimated growth of 6.5% in 2017. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is even lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently, the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share, as well as fuelling overall tea consumption growth.
Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2018-19 by market saturation and weakening demographics. Indeed, the FAO forecasts an overall contraction until 2024 in many EU markets (which together account for just under 5% of global consumption), despite a firmer economic performance, as well as in Russia (2.5% of global consumption). Turkey, which also accounts for around 5% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting continued population growth and steady growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. We forecast average annual growth in tea demand in 2018-19 of 1.9% in the EU and 0.4% in Turkey. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.5% per year, but is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consump-tion in 2013-16.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for less than 2.5% of global consumption, and consumption per head is low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea. We expect demand to increase by an annual average of 2.6% in 2018-19, partly reflecting our fairly upbeat forecast for economic growth. Health concerns will also sustain demand for tea, with a gradual shift away from carbonated beverages and towards those perceived as healthier, including tea.
New tea markets are emerging
Export data from tea-producing countries reveal that new markets for tea are emerging, with the number of countries buying tea at the major auction houses in Asia and Africa on the rise. Demand from these new joiners in the tea market, mainly faster-growing emerging countries, is set to increase in 2018-19, underpinning our forecast for average consumption growth of 2.5% a year across all "other" countries, which together account for 18% of global consumption.

Supply
After an estimated 1.7% contraction in global tea production in 2017-the first fall in output since our data series (which is based on historical data from the FAO) began in 2000-tea production is forecast to recover in 2018-19, rising by 3.5% and 2.1% respectively. However, these growth rates remain weak by historical comparison; annual growth in tea output averaged 4.4% in 2004-14. Other than weather concerns, several structural factors will prevent faster production growth. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades because of the higher cost of inputs, and this has resulted in a fall in investment. Notwithstanding a recent softening of the US dollar, many currencies will remain comparatively weak against the dollar in 2018-19, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers.
Much of the increase in global tea production in 2018-19 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects the rise in tea production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, compared with 43% a decade ago.
As in 2016, adverse weather will harm Chinese tea production in 2017
China experienced the second consecutive year of disappointing tea production growth in 2017. We estimate that output expanded by 2.2%, after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, in June. The government stated that over 750,000 ha of crops were damaged, and although it made no direct reference to tea, we believe that production was affected. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which will also have hampered production.
Even on the assumption that weather conditions will improve in 2018-19, prod-uction growth is forecast to slow further, to an annual average of 2%. Under-lying economic growth will slow gradually during 2018 as the govern-ment takes action to bring debt levels under control, and is not projected to accelerate significantly in 2019. We expect government efforts to modernise the agri-cultural sector-through large-scale lending from the state-owned Agricultural Development Bank of China-to progress slowly, with some Chinese tea investors instead seeking to expand production overseas rather than in China (talks are under way to discuss the possibility of a 6,000-ha tea plantation in the Philippines). These factors will combine to undermine growth in tea output.
Beyond the forecast period there is scope for a return to firmer rates of tea production growth. The authorities are engaged in efforts to lift product quality and quantity in order to boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Given that China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 785 kg in 2012-14, compared with 2,085 kg in India and 2,105 kg in Kenya), there is certainly potential for gains in productivity.
India's tea production will continue to grow in 2018 and 2019
We estimate tea production growth of 3.3% in India in 2017. Output fell in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state), as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India, but weather conditions improved subsequently. Assuming supportive weather conditions in 2018-19, we expect tea production to continue to rise, albeit more gradually. Continued efforts to channel funding to tea growers will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly and rising input costs have eroded profits, implying that in the long term India may struggle to increase growth as significantly as other major producers. We forecast average growth in tea production of 2% per year in 2018-19.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
We estimate a double-digit decline in tea output in Sri Lanka in 2017, reflecting recent torrential rain that caused landslides and the worst flooding in over a decade. The authorities have said that this will affect tea output, as the worst-affected areas were tea-growing regions in the south of the country. Many of the 400,000 farmers, who account for 70% of national tea output, saw their bushes submerged by muddy water. Sri Lanka's tea production is forecast to rise in 2018, by 5.8%, but this will largely reflect a cyclical recovery after several disappointing years. As in India, there are several structural hurdles that will hamper growth, even assuming that weather conditions improve. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not yet sufficiently high to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. In addition, there are local reports that fertiliser application has been low, and there is a continued risk of industrial unrest. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. These factors explain why our projection for tea production growth in 2019 (1.8%) is relatively weak.
Moreover, the main customers for Sri Lankan tea-Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria-have all experienced economic turbulence in recent years. Economic conditions are expected to improve markedly in Iran with the lifting of sanctions, and to a lesser degree in Russia and Turkey, but this is unlikely to be enough to boost demand for Sri Lankan tea significantly. Most of the country's tea is loose leaf, rather than mass-produced tea bags, which limits the extent to which the country can diversify its tea export market base towards Europe and the US. The Ministry of Plantation Industries has stated that it is considering a proposal to allow tea imports for blending in an attempt to boost export potential, and the Tea Board is continuing to urge the government to take measures to make the tea industry more competitive, but it is unclear if there is sufficient support domestically to push the measure through, as there is a strong perception among farmers that this would undermine local production.
A partial recovery in output is likely in Kenya in 2018-19
After a massive jump in tea production in Kenya in 2016, with output hitting an all-time high of 473,000 tonnes, weather conditions deteriorated sharply in 2017, with a renewed and persistent dry spell damaging tea plantations. Kenya's agriculture minister has stated that tea output is likely to fall by 12%, but our estimate envisages a much sharper drop, of 30%, given that production was down by about one-third in the first eight months of the year. Although tea production is forecast to stage a partial recovery in 2018-19, rising by 24.2% and 4.9% respectively, output levels even in 2019 will remain relatively weak. Periodic industrial activity in the sector over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers, so that it is based on the value rather than the volume of sales, will also undermine profitability in the medium term. Although the government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, conflicting interests and a lack of funds will hinder progress.

Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes three to five years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact on output of recent price falls will be evident only after the forecast period.
Stocks and prices
We estimate a fourth consecutive year of market deficits in 2017, reflecting increasing consumption and a contraction in output from several of the main tea-producing countries. We expect consumption growth to outstrip production growth during 2018-19, meaning that we forecast deepening market deficits in those years.
Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge how significantly these widening market deficits will affect stock levels. The fact that prices fell during 2015-16 despite market deficits in both years indicates that stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output in China, which mainly consists of green tea. Although some of the production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.

Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya respectively (essentially, black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. As an example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have risen sharply in 2017 (with the former hitting record levels of US$4/kg as production has slumped), while prices at the Kolkata auction have remained similar to their year-earlier levels for much of the year. Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes (there is no futures market). Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat slightly in 2018-19
We estimate a full-year average price of US$3.09/kg in 2017, a 17.2% year-on-year increase, reflecting the weak outlook for production and continued firm consumption growth. Although the market deficit will remain large in 2018-19, recovering production is expected to reduce prices by 2.8%, to an average of US$3/kg in 2018, and by a further 6.3% in 2019, to US$2.81/kg.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has increased strongly in the past 50 years, rising from less than 250m tonnes/year (t/y) in the early 1960s to more than 700m t/y in recent years. Helped by solid gains in developing countries, growth was particularly rapid in the three decades to 1990, rising by an average of 3% a year, before slowing slightly since then. Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been tied to a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has persistently outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and for the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global consumption to rise marginally, by 0.5%, to nearly 739m tonnes in 2017/18. Although wheat use for food is expected to increase once again, in line with the recent trend, it appears likely that world feed consumption will decline, owing partly to competition from alternative products. A similar pattern is expected in 2018/19. Although use for feed is expected to slip back further, a rise for milling and food use should see total demand increase by 0.4%, to 742m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in world food-wheat consumption has remained relatively consistent over the past decade or so, with increases averaging 1.4% a year. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods such as noodles, as well as Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports, with world trade expanding in most years. Although diets in the fastest-growing consumer markets are expected to diversify as incomes improve, to include additional animal proteins, dairy products and oil crops, in general there has been little evidence of slowing food wheat demand in recent years. We therefore expect world food use to rise by 1.5% in 2017/18, exceeding 500m tonnes for the first time. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa. These trends are well established and are expected to continue into 2018/19, when food consumption could rise to 511m tonnes.
World feed use is forecast at a higher than usual level in 2016/17
Wheat contains high levels of starch, which makes it a good, energy-rich ingredient for livestock feed. Demand for feed wheat shows more annual variation than that for food-use wheat, and is highly dependent on price and underlying quality considerations. Direct, on-farm feed use also varies from one year to the next, depending on the size and quality of the crop in a particular season. Use for feed has averaged around 141m t/y during the past five years. Wheat is the world's second most important feed grain, although it is typically equivalent to one-quarter of feed-use of maize, with annual wheat use roughly matching that of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. The EU is typically the world's largest consumer of feed quality wheat, with consumption averaging close to 57m tonnes in recent seasons-around 40% of the world total. Other large users include Russia, with demand of around 17m tonnes, China (15m tonnes) and the US (5m tonnes). Depending on price, feed manufacturers in Asia, including South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, have also incorporated relatively large amounts into feed rations in recent years.
Assuming strong competition from maize-especially in the EU, China and the US-we expect use for livestock feed to fall back by 3.7% year on year in 2017/18, to around 144m tonnes. The figure for Canada is also forecast to be sharply lower than last year, dropping by about half, to 3m tonnes, on much smaller feed grade supplies. At the moment, we forecast a modest decline in global demand for feed-grade wheat in 2018/19, to around 144m tonnes. The drop stems mainly from a projected small decline in Russia, where a smaller crop is likely to limit discretionary on-farm feeding.
Mexico is eyeing wheat imports from Argentina
Mexico's phytosanitary authority recently finalised a long-awaited protocol al-lowing for the import of wheat from Argentina. A group of millers have already contracted a trial shipment, due to be loaded later next month, which will first be assessed for quality before further purchases are considered. Although there is talk that the move is in some way linked to the ongoing North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations, private importers have indicated that the deal instead reflects very competitive pricing in Argentina, which is currently the world's cheapest origin. Indeed, local users have proven quite willing to switch origins in recent years, sourcing a number of cargoes from the Black Sea and occasionally the EU. Compared with maize and sorghum, Mexico's wheat import market is much more diversified. However, millers still typically only use such wheats for blending with US supplies, which still account for as much as 75% of overseas purchases. Mexico typically imports around two-thirds of its annual needs, with domestic consumption increasing steadily in recent decades, forecast at around 7.8m tonnes in 2017/18. Although a series of anti-obesity campaigns have curbed demand for cakes, pastries and cookies in the past few years, production of other, plainer bread products remains strong, and population growth continues to drive demand.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, with cumulative output hitting new highs each year between 2013/14 and 2016/17. Production gains have stemmed mainly from the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia, but China, India and parts of Latin America have also contributed bigger crops. The harvested area has increased across many parts of the globe, and average yields have also risen, despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat seed technology. However, given recent spells of poor weather across wheat belts in both hemispheres, the recent growth trend is expected to come to a halt. In 2017/18 we forecast global wheat production to decline by 0.8% year on year, to 749m tonnes, owing largely to lower output from the US, Canada and Australia. Russia's massive 2017/18 crop has diverted some attention away from the fact that supplies of the best quality, high-protein wheats from North America and parts of Europe will be below average levels and will therefore command a price premium. The 2018/19 sowing season is now coming to an end in parts of the northern hemisphere. With prices at relatively low levels, there is unlikely to be much incentive for farmers to increase plantings. Crop rotation needs will again be important, but in countries where there are few alternatives, seeded area is unlikely to show much year-on-year change. Assuming average yields, the world crop is forecast to contract by another 0.9% in 2018/19, to 742m tonnes.
After a small EU crop last year, output should rise in 2017/18
Despite a mixed year for the main EU wheat growers, the 2017/18 crop is expected to be slightly larger than average. We have lifted our production forecast by a further 1.4m tonnes, to a total of 151.5m tonnes, incorporating the latest official harvest data. Final results from the French harvest, which accounts for around one-quarter of the bloc's total output, were better than previously reported, with yields rebounding strongly from the previous season's sub-par results. Survey results have also confirmed its good quality, with a much higher percentage than last year meeting milling specifications. In contrast, a wet finish to the German harvest has led to a series of quality downgrades in key northern export-producing areas. As most of the EU crop is winter sown, producers are now wrapping up 2018/19 planting in some parts. Farmers have again expressed concerns about market prices currently being lower than production costs. Some planted area may be switched to attractively priced rapeseed, but given the lack of viable alternatives for many farmers, we do not expect much change in plantings for next year's harvest. Assuming normal yields, output is likely to be in line with the average, at 148m tonnes.
An enormous crop in Russia
The size of this season's winter wheat crop in Russia has caught market observers by surprise. With farmers continuing to report astounding yields, local production estimates increased on an almost daily basis at some points in the summer. Yields have been above or in line with record levels in all the major growing areas, with a particularly sharp improvement noted in the Volga District. Excellent yields are attributed mainly to abundant springtime rains, but with the crops also well established after a successful period of overwintering. We maintain our forecast that Russia's 2017/18 wheat outturn will rise by nearly 13% year on year, to a record 82m tonnes. Attention is now beginning to switch to 2018/19 prospects. Recent dry weather in southern areas has not been ideal for early crop establishment but has allowed for a quick start to planting, and winter sowings stand to beat the official target again. Assuming that yields are similar to the recent trend, but down from the record-breaking results achieved this year, we expect 2018/19 output to decline by around 12%, to 72m tonnes, which is still an impressive outturn.
US wheat production fell sharply in 2017/18
US all-wheat production in 2017/18 totals 47.4m tonnes, according to the Small Grains Summary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). This is slightly above earlier estimates but still down by 25% year on year, and at a fifteen-season low. The sharp drop in output mainly reflects a pullback in plantings, with the smallest harvested area in almost 130 years. The winter wheat outturn was 34.5m tonnes (down by 24% year on year), with durum at 1.5m tonnes (down by 47%) and other spring varieties at 10.7m tonnes (down by 27%). Sowing of next season's winter wheat crop was almost done by the first week of November, only slightly slower than average. Reflecting a dry start to the season in some states, only 52% of the crop had emerged in good or excellent condition, 6 percentage points lower than at the same point a year ago. Depressed prices and limited potential for profits mean that another drop in winter and spring plantings is now likely. Assuming better overall yields, however, mainly for spring-sown wheat, 2018/19 production is forecast to rise by 4.9%, to 49.7m tonnes, about 11% below the previous five-year average.
China's wheat support policies are starting to change
Latest official data from China confirmed a small rise in 2017/18 wheat production, as an improvement in yields more than compensated for a minor reduction in harvested area. After shortfalls in high-quality wheat the year before, Ministry of Agriculture officials reported far fewer problems with excessive moisture and disease this season. High- and low-gluten wheat varieties, needed to produce Western style breads and cakes, accounted for almost 28% of this year's crop, up by nearly 3 percentage points from 2016/17. After focusing first on efforts to realign cotton, maize, rapeseed and soybean markets with international prices, authorities are now beginning to tweak foodgrain price support policies too. Following changes to rice subsidy programmes last year, the government recently announced a 2.5% reduction in the 2018/19 minimum state purchase price for wheat, the first such cut since the initiative was introduced 11 years ago. Although unusual, next year's minimum price of Rmb2,300/tonne (US$348/tonne) is still about double the current price of US winter wheat and around US$100/tonne above milling wheat import prices, including freight costs. However, it must be stressed that imports are, in effect, limited by the country's tariff rate quota (TRQ), under which the private sector is only eligible to buy slightly less than 1m tonnes at the reduced 1% import duty. The policy announcement was not a big surprise and had been well-flagged by party officials in recent months.
With winter wheat planting for next year's crop already mostly finished, the policy shift is unlikely to have much of an impact for 2018/19. Sowings are expected to stay relatively high, more or less unchanged from the year before, with production tentatively placed at 129m tonnes. The announcement could, however, mark the start of some wider-ranging reforms in the years ahead as the government looks to unwind its excessively large wheat stocks, which have been built up in recent years. Should the lower support price feed through into lower market values for common wheat, a wider price differential could encourage farmers to further expand production of the higher-quality wheats in the years ahead. This could have some implications for imports, which have ranged from 1.9m tonnes to 6.8m tonnes during the past five years, and are mostly used to plug shortfalls in local high-quality wheat supplies.
Wheat is back in favour with Argentinian farmers
In Argentina, policy changes made under the government that came into power in late 2015, including exchange-rate liberalisation and the removal of export quotas and taxes, have greatly incentivised the country's wheat farmers. Planting of the 2017/18 crop was completed by late August, but with the planted area falling short of earlier expectations. Flooding prevented access to low-lying fields across southern parts of Buenos Aires and La Pampa provinces, where as much as 150,000 ha of intended wheat area was thought to have gone unseeded. Some local sources recently estimated that about half of the country's total wheat area had been affected by excessive water this season, which hindered farmers' ability to control disease and apply fertilisers. With dryness also persisting in more northerly areas, 2017/18 wheat production is forecast to decline by 8% year on year, to 16m tonnes.

Stocks and prices
Cumulative world stocks are predicted to rise for the fifth consecutive season in 2017/18, reaching 251m tonnes, up by 4% year on year to an all-time high. However, this large total figure masks some important features, as gains in world inventories are mostly attributed to rises in end-season stocks in India and China, whose stocks are not available on the world market. Indeed, with China's stocks having doubled over a five-year period, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to use carryovers in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supplies. Cumulative stockpiles in those countries are forecast to drop by around 7% year on year, to 70.8m tonnes, but will still be up by 12% from the average in recent years. The projection for 2018/19 is provisional, but suggests a continuation of the most recent trend. World stocks are likely to remain high, and are currently expected to be fractionally higher compared with the previous year, at 252m tonnes, but with the outlook skewed by an even larger figure for China. Exporter stocks of 62.7m tonnes, although not considered especially tight, would be the smallest in five years.
Russia's wheat stocks have almost tripled in just three years
Although Russia's exports have been running at a record pace in recent months, infrastructure capacity constraints mean that July-June shipments could be limited to around 33m tonnes, nowhere near enough to prevent a further build-up in 2017/18 stocks. Works to upgrade existing terminals are ongoing, and although new port facilities are also being planned for construction, including in eastern parts of the country, close to China, these projects are expected to take three or more years to complete. Following two successive massive crops, wheat stocks are expected to reach a record high at the end of the current marketing year, potentially reaching 16.8m tonnes, up from just 5.6m tonnes two seasons ago. According to the Russian Grain Union, a non-governmental farmers' association, the country currently has 120m tonnes of grain-storage capacity. Elevator capacity totals only about 40m tonnes or so, with the remainder made up mostly of on-farm barns and warehouses, which, although much cheaper for storing grains, are susceptible to greater post-harvest losses, estimated at up to 3%. Most of the country's storage facilities are in need of upgrading, with the best facilities mainly located close to the key southern producing and exporting areas. High stock levels are expected to keep a lid on prices heading into the next season and, even if 2018/19 production falls short of recent levels, the additional supplies should provide a cushion, allowing Russia to maintain its dominant position on the world export market.

Wheat prices are likely to remain weak in the short term
Trading in world wheat markets has fluctuated in recent months. Steep early-summer gains, linked primarily to a drought in parts of the US and Canada, were later erased on the back of better than expected results from harvests in the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia. Amid overall heavy world availabilities and strong competition for available export business, wheat prices at most major origins eased during October, dipping by an average of 3%. Declines in the US were tied partly to sluggish overseas demand and a bearishly interpreted USDA supply-and-demand report. In contrast, buoyant export demand and logistical bottlenecks continued to shore up Black Sea export quotations, particularly in Russia, where port capacity is likely to be stretched this season. In addition, with some farmers said to have secured sufficient funds to cover near-term commitments, a number of producers were more reluctant to sell at current prices. With Russian shipments expected to remain high throughout the season, strong export competition is likely to keep a lid on prices, at least for next year. Assuming that crop prospects do not deteriorate further, we expect Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat export prices (12% protein, fob Gulf) to fall steadily until mid-2018, before strengthening slightly thereafter. However, higher protein supplies are expected to command a hefty price premium, at least until the 2018/19 northern hemisphere crops enter the pipeline.

Abstract: [...]since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. Since the failed coup, Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [...]the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the narrow referendum vic-tory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened social and political divisions.
The presidential reform, which is due to take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised.
Since the failed coup, Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of tighter global liquidity. A recovery began in the fourth quarter of 2016, supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to accelerate to an estimated 5.5% in 2017 and to average 4.2% in 2018-22.
We estimate that the Turkish lira will average TL3.66:US$1 in 2017, a fall of 17.4% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.28:US$1 in 2022. The Central Bank of Turkey will be constrained in its ability to tighten interest rates. It will have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to currency weakness and high inflation.
We expect the current-account deficit to be slightly larger in the forecast period compared with 2016, and to remain sufficiently substantial to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but the country's global ranking falls by 13 places, to 58th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, have been announced for 2018, to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concerns about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Third Istanbul airport becomes operational. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely following the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%, but the government plans to increase it to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Among the most important political events in the 2018-22 forecast period will be the three crucial votes in 2019: municipal elections are due to be held in March of that year, and parliamentary and presidential elections in November. After these votes, an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parliamentary system. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. Failure to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving the country to a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
Although the intense political instability that followed the failed coup has eased partially since the April referendum, we expect renewed social and political instability during the period up to and beyond the 2019 elections. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, has further polarised the country. It has also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and his party are losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place for the foreseeable future because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
We expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the municipal, presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019. Although there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and his party has the ability to control the election process. Moreover, the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. The right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP), which fielded a join candidate with the Republican People's Party (CHP) against Mr Erdogan in the 2014 presidential election, has more recently been supportive of the president. The charismatic Meral Aksener, who has broken away from the MHP, is a possible challenger. She has formed a new centre-right party, the Good Party (IP), and has declared that she will run against Mr Erdogan in the presidential election. However, it is unlikely that she will win, unless Mr Erdogan fails to obtain 50% of votes in the first round, leading to a second-round run-off against the candidate with the second-highest share of the vote. Ms Aksener would need the support of the CHP and have to attract votes from incompatible constituencies, including Kurds and nationalists, who currently vote for the AKP.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
There is a growing risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding concerns that under the leadership of Mr Erdogan and the AKP the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of Syrian Kurdish groups, which Turkey regards as terrorist organisa-tions affiliated to the PKK; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of Turkey's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably his push to become president with executive powers after the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.
We expect that Turkey and its Western allies will seek to avoid a complete breakdown in relations, which could materialise if, among other things, the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, Turkey closes the Incirlik airbase to US forces, or withdraws from NATO. However, if tensions remain at current levels for a prolonged period Turkey's strategic relationships with the EU and the US are likely to suffer irreparable damage, and become increasingly antagonistic and transactional.
The spillover of violence from the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq will continue to pose serious domestic and external security threats to Turkey. In addition to terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey by IS and the PKK, which has camps in the mountains in northern Iraq, Turkey now has military forces de-ployed in two areas in Syria, ostensibly as part of the fight against IS but also to prevent US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds from establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions. The level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows have already put the lira under pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. The most recent bout of volatility, in October and November, has probably been prompted by expectations of balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region. Even if the lira continues to depreciate, the Central Bank of Turkey will be constrained in its ability to further tighten interest rates. It will have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to currency weakness and high inflation. An abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary to halt the lira's slide. However, this is not our baseline scenario, as the central bank will remain under pressure from the government not to raise rates, especially ahead of the 2019 election.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy at the same time as encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and to prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to expand from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.2% in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.5% in 2022. Although the government debt/GDP ratio edged up slightly in 2016, to 29.2%, we expect it to decline gradually, to 27.5% in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
In November political pressure on the central bank to lower interest rates in order to support economic activity increased again, even as the government has focused its attention on Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance sheet tapering. We expect the central bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and from November 2017 will only be funding the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 25 basis points, to 12.25% in late April, where it has since remained. The weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has therefore increased to 12.25%, from 12% previously. This is well above its level of 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy caused by the failed coup in July that year, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in October-December 2016, and we expect growth to accelerate to 5.5% in full-year 2017 and to average 4.2% in 2018-22. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. There are downside risks to our forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government in the next few years does not lead to further political instability that could deter foreign capital inflows.
We expect a moderate improvement in household confidence, a recovery in employment growth and possible additional government incentives to support household spending. We forecast average real private consumption growth of 3.4% in 2017-22.
We expect government consumption growth to slow from an estimated 7% in 2017 to a still solid annual average of 6% in 2018-19 as the government continues to support the economy ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate, but still robust.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure, generating real growth of 6% per year in 2017-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in main export markets, especially Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-22. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors and weigh on the tourism sector. Our expectation is that a slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2021. There are significant upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Amid further bouts of volatility we estimate that the lira will depreciate against the US dollar in 2017, to an annual average of TL3.66:US$1, a fall of 17.4% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.28:US$1 in 2022. The lira will depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-22. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account deficit to widen moderately and remain large enough, at an average of 4.6% of GDP per year in 2017-22, to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in 2017, but the sector is likely to take several years to recover to its 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election was held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP's new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, propelled his party into first place. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The SPÖ has announced its intention to go into opposition.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to sanctions from other EU member states as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
We expect any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just above 71% by 2022, from an estimated 79.7% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.4% in that year. We estimate an acceleration of growth this year, to 2.9%, and forecast that growth will moderate to 1.7% on average in 2018-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we expect an annual average of 2.1% in 2017-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain relatively stable in the forecast period, at 2% of GDP on average in 2017-22.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). As a result, the country remains in 11th place in the regional ranking but falls one place in the global ranking, dropping to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. No progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities were to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best under any next government, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and reformed the party around himself. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share, up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
Coalition negotiations are continuing, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a coalition to emerge in late 2017 or early 2018, consisting of the ÖVP and the FPÖ, led by Mr Kurz as chancellor. Although technically a majority coalition including the SPÖ would be possible, either in the form of another grand coalition or an SPÖ-FPÖ coalition, the SPÖ has indicated that it will go into opposition. Mr Kurz has stated that he could also form a minority government should negotiations fail. However, there is little precedent for this in Austria. That the programmes of the ÖVP and the FPÖ are close to each other (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly criticised Mr Kurz for stealing the FPÖ's programme) should help them to reach an agreement. The president, who has a relatively large role in the government-formation process, including the right to veto ministerial appointees, could still block the formation of a right-wing government, but this is not our core forecast.
Although we expect a chancellor from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP and the FPÖ's programmes, we expect the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, and the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. It was won by the ÖVP, who we expect to form a government with the FPÖ. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit until the end of the term of the new Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) in late 2022.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which could exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that any government under him will have to be pro-EU, and we therefore do not expect Austria's EU membership to be questioned in the coming years. The FPÖ has also moderated its critique of the bloc. We expect Austria to be a leading voice in the EU in the coming years, especially on reform of migration. We expect it to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries, Italy and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, little progress was made. The next govern-ment, which we expect to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right, and it is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 2% in 2013, and public debt rose to 83.7% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.7% in 2017 to just above 71% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that will run at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The economic recovery in the euro zone has strengthened this year and has become more broad based. We expect a healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 2.3%, after growth of 1.9% on average in 2015-16. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, but maintains a clearly dovish policy stance, with the reduction in the amount of monthly QE purchases in 2018 designed to extend its presence in the bond markets. The bank also plans to delay raising interest rates and reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities for a period well beyond the end of the QE programme. We expect the pace of monthly QE purchases to be reduced to zero in early 2019, but owing to subdued price pressure and persistent downside risks to growth, we forecast that the bank will delay raising policy rates until 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 1.1% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.4%, it remained below Germany's 1.9% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.7% between July 2016 and September 2017. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, in part owing to a surge in employment in the manu-facturing sector, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.6% this year. Furthermore, export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to 2.9% this year, above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.1%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have been a one-off. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy-price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation from October 2016 into 2017, when we estimate full-year average inflation of 2.2%. Recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect it to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the US presidential election led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle down-turn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. We expect the euro to appreciate further in 2022 as the monetary policy tightening cycle begins.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-16, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect the trade balance to move back into a modest deficit from 2017 as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, we expect the services balance largely to outweigh the weakening trade balance and the current-account surplus to remain broadly flat throughout 2017-22, at about 2% of GDP on average.

World Commodity Forecasts Food Feedstuffs and Beverages November 2017

https://www.proquest.com/reports/world-commodity-forecasts-food-feedstuffs/docview/1972340229/se-2?accountid=14357

Abstract: Stocks are forecast to exceed 2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is very high by historical comparison. [...]there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output. [...]a modest slowdown in economic growth in emerging markets (particularly in Asia) will dampen the pace of consumption growth in the coming years. [...]heightened awareness about the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put pressure on consumption growth in developed markets, where the average consumption often already exceeds recommended levels. Amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products, a gradual shift towards synthetic sweeteners will somewhat lessen demand for sugar. [...]owing to the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market will be liberalised in September 2017), these cheaper alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. [...]younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base.

Note. WCF (World commodity forecasts) is an index of 22 hard and soft commodities. FFB (Food, feedstuffs and beverages) is a price index of 13 soft commodities. The beverages sector has a weight of 20% in the FFB index, grains 46.4%, oilseeds 28.6% and sugar 4.9%. The FFB index has a weight of 55.6% in the WCF index.
Agricultural prices will remain weak in early 2018, sinking the annual average
The Economist Intelligence Unit's food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index is set to fall in year-on-year terms in 2018-the seventh consecutive year of decline-by 1%. This is a smaller margin than the estimated drop in prices, of 1.3%, in 2017, as the markets for some agricultural goods, including oilseeds and grains such as wheat, maize and rice are beginning to tighten slightly. Nonetheless, most agricultural markets remain comfortably supplied, following several years of bumper harvests. Several crops have registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. Although there is a risk that a La Niña weather event will have a negative effect on crop yields in the 2017/18 season, therefore pushing up prices, this remains unlikely at the moment, and we have not included an agricultural price shock in our forecast. We expect the FFB index to begin to firm from late 2018, rising by an average of 2.8% in 2019, as a number of markets tighten further, causing prices for a number of goods, including coffee, cocoa and wheat, to recover from rock bottom. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) of FFB goods in the medium and long term.
There will be only a mild recovery in prices in 2019
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw upon. We expect global GDP growth to remain fairly robust, at an average of 2.7% per year in 2018-19, down only slightly from estimated growth of 2.9% in 2017. However, the looming economic slowdown in China and uncertainty about global monetary policy continue to pose downside risks to demand. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. We expect the US dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19, which will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further inflating global supplies. As a result, even though prices will begin to recover in 2019, we expect the FFB index to remain well below 2014 levels, on the back of ample global supply.
Grain prices will post small rises, failing to recover to 2015 levels in 2017-18
We now expect grain prices to weaken on average in 2018, by a modest 0.4%; nonetheless, this is a downward revision from our previous forecast of a slight uptick in grain prices (1%), as wheat and soybean prices now look set to remain fairly weak. Nonetheless, the price declines in 2018 will be modest in comparison with the previous three seasons, when supply surged and global stocks accumulated. For wheat in particular, international prices appear to have found a floor after two years of sharp decline. Average world wheat prices surged in mid-2017, as drought in the northern US Plains region and dryness in parts of the EU, Australia and the Black Sea region, raised concerns over tighter global supply. However, the damage to crops was less serious than initially expected, and we forecast prices to ease gradually throughout 2018 as the rapid growth in 2017 proves difficult to replicate, before rising again in 2019. Maize prices will remain weak through the third quarter of 2017, undermined by the bumper 2016/17 crop, before rising steadily over the course of 2018-19 as global consumption rises-particularly for animal feed-and the market tightens.
Oilseed prices will rise in 2018-19 as oversupplied markets begin to tighten
Oilseed prices fell by an estimated 2.1% in 2017, owing largely to the bumper soybean crop in major producers, such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stocks higher. However, we expect the price of soybeans, as well as rapeseed oil and sunflowerseed oil, to see robust growth in 2018-19 as market supply begins to tighten and global demand remains strong. Only palm oil prices are likely to drop throughout 2018-19 as global production surges, but changing consumer habits-particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have shifted consumer tastes to alternative products-will result in lower demand growth.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We forecast the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee and cocoa, to fall again in 2018, for the sixth consecutive year. We forecast cocoa prices to decline only modestly in 2018-19, by an average of 1.6% per year; nonetheless, this follows a massive drop, of an estimated 30%, in 2017, as a result of soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices are expected to dip slightly in 2018 as global supplies rise slightly and as the strong US dollar encourages exporters to sell their stocks. In 2019, however, we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to rise by 8.5% as several consecutive years of market deficits finally begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2018-19, but by a marginal amount
Sugar prices declined by an estimated 10.7% in 2017 as the market corrected after a price spike in late 2016 that was related to fears that supply from Thailand would be heavily affected by poor weather conditions. We expect global consumption to expand by a modest 1.3% per year on average in 2018-19 as high domestic prices limit demand in India, the second-largest global consumer. Recent weakness in global oil prices will also play a role as cheaper energy products incentivise farmers to divert more cane to sugar (rather than to its rival, ethanol), further increasing sugar supply and limiting price growth throughout the forecast period.

Cocoa
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that, after having contracted for two consecutive crop years, cocoa consumption grew by a marginal 0.4% in the 2016/17 season (October-September. Although cocoa demand is expected to accelerate slightly during the forecast period, by 1% in 2017/18 and by 1.2% in 2018/19, it remains fairly weak by historical comparison. Recent cocoa grind data point to a somewhat stronger third quarter of 2017 in Europe, in line with our current projections for a gradual pick-up in demand, but none of the main developed markets will be in a position to fuel rapid growth in cocoa consumption, reflecting high existing cocoa consumption levels per head. In contrast to some other soft commodity markets, where producing countries are starting to become major consumers, cocoa consumption levels among producers are (and will remain) extremely low, hampering the scope for firmer global growth in cocoa consumption. Meanwhile, recent falls in cocoa prices will be slow to feed through to retail prices, which will continue to push some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. The average size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity, but also to protect profits during a time of high cocoa prices. Assuming that bar sizes do not increase, this will also hamper cocoa consumption growth.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in much of the OECD-even bearing in mind the repercussions of a slowdown in China in 2018. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical: manufacturers stepped up grinding in the previous decade in response to a rapid increase in demand for powder, only to be faced with a significant surplus since 2011. This subsequently caused shortages of butter. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounts for 26% of the world's imports of cocoa powder, compared with just 13% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to boost demand for powder.
Higher prices will slow consumption growth in developed markets
Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for 20% of global demand) and Europe (which collectively accounts for 40% of global demand) are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate (with a higher cocoa content), but with less frequent purchases. Recent sales figures from the main chocolate manufacturers indicate that, on balance, this is pushing down overall consumption. This is substantiated by data from 2015/16, which show that cocoa consumption contracted in several large markets (including the US and Canada) while registering marginal growth in others (particularly in Europe), despite stronger underlying economic conditions in many of these countries.
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2017/18-2018/19. Health concerns and changing retail habits will constrain consumption (the rise of internet grocery shopping will erode spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases), as will market saturation. Europe's three largest buyers (Germany, France and the UK) have among the highest cocoa consumption rates per head in the world, at 3.5-4.5 kg annually. However, sharp increases in consumption growth of dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will put a floor under overall cocoa consumption.
Russian and Brazilian cocoa consumption will begin to recover
Lower cocoa consumption in 2015/16 in Brazil and Russia, which together account for nearly 10% of global demand, demonstrate the extent to which cocoa demand is affected by underlying economic conditions, particularly in developing economies, where chocolate is not regarded as a basic good. We estimate that both of these countries saw consumption contract further in 2016/17-despite a return to modest GDP growth in both countries in 2017-reflecting the high cost of cocoa in local-currency terms. For Russia, restrictions on a number of imports from the EU that have been in place since mid-2014 are having an adverse effect on demand for many consumer goods. We expect cocoa demand in Russia to stage a gradual recovery in 2017/18 and 2018/19, growing by an average 1.4% per year. In Brazil, cocoa consumption rose rapidly until 2014 but has fallen steadily since then, amid a domestic recession. As with Russia, we forecast a gradual recovery in cocoa consumption growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19, averaging around 1.5% per year, on the assumption that underlying economic conditions improve somewhat.

Cocoa consumption growth will slow in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa consumption, given currently low per-head consumption levels (at just 37 g in India and 59 g in China in 2015/16, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets). However, cocoa demand will be hampered by high retail prices and, in China, consumer caution amid wider economic uncertainty, particularly in 2018-19. This will cut cocoa consumption growth in the coming years, from 5% in 2017/18 to 3.5% in 2018/19. In India, we expect demand growth to accelerate from 3.4% in 2017/18 to 4.2% in 208/19, owing to firmer underlying economic conditions.
Supply
Global cocoa production surged by an estimated 11.9% in 2016/17 on the back of improved weather conditions, after a particularly difficult El Niño event and a severe harmattan season (a dry winter wind blowing from the Sahara), cut cocoa output in many of Africa's main producers in 2015/16. We expect global cocoa production to fall during 2017/18 and 2018/19, by 3.8% and 1.2% respectively, mainly reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire-the world's largest cocoa producer. Its output will remain high by historical comparison, but another bumper crop is unlikely, reflecting lower farmgate prices and weaker confidence among growers. Overall, recent price weakness is likely to dissuade farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticide, contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production.
Structural and geographic factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farmgate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa, but farmers receive a much smaller share of the final retail price than has been the case in previous decades, owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. Many farmers in West Africa remain below the poverty line, and as a consequence few young people in the region are choosing to work in the cocoa sector, instead opting for more profitable crops or moving to cities in search of non-agricultural work. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to encourage people to work in the cocoa sector, but it is uncertain how effective these methods will be in the long term, particularly given recent falls in global prices and weak public finances.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can be grown only in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) and in warm, humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Nonetheless, there are countries that have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of manufacturing facilities to grind beans in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production is forecast to soar in 2016/17
In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa production jumped by an estimated 25.9% in 2016/17 to a record 2m tonnes as the sector recovered from the impact of dry weather associated with El Niño in 2015/16, when output fell sharply. We expect cocoa production to fall by 8.5% in 2017/18 and by 2.2% in 2018/19. It is unlikely that the authorities will be able to replicate the exceptionally high level of output registered in 2016/17, with the state-run cocoa authority, the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC) issuing fewer export licences than ahead of the 2016/17 season and projecting production in 2017/18 in the range of 1.725m-1.75m tonnes. Although our forecast is slightly more upbeat, we still expect output to fall steadily in the forecast period. Policy will not be particularly supportive: following a sharp cut to farmgate prices ahead of the mid-crop in March 2017, the CCC has kept prices on hold for the 2017/18 harvest, with price levels around one-third lower than a year ago. The government had hoped to raise farmgate prices, but any increase in the producer price would mean cutting export duties and therefore forgoing fiscal revenue, which is unlikely. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from global price volatility, but these funds have seemingly been insufficient to shield farmers' incomes and-given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC-neither farmers nor exporters have confidence that losses arising from low global prices will be recouped. These factors will combine to drag on overall cocoa production.
Ghanaian government will struggle to boost cocoa production significantly
In Ghana, we estimate that cocoa production continued to rebound in 2016/17, with favourable weather and a mild harmattan season lifting cocoa production to an estimated 850,000 tonnes (above the official target of 800,000 tonnes). We do not expect further significant and sustained growth in production during the 2017/18-2018/19 forecast period. For now, Ghana's cocoa board (Cocobod) has been more reluctant than the Côte d'Ivoire authorities to cut prices paid to farmers, but Cocobod has been forced to seek a bridging loan from the central bank, indicating that farmgate prices may need to be cut, particularly if global cocoa prices fail to recover. Combined with anxiety among farmers about the government's intentions to evolve agriculture towards other crops, ongoing encroachment by gold miners and the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser, production will remain steady at best during the forecast period.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally three to five years). The authorities ultimately aim to raise production to 1.5m tonnes within four years, also driven by better soil management, and better pest and disease control. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (Cocobod estimates 40%) and a consequent low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). Replanting, in particular, will help to address the problem of swollen shoot disease, which affects nearly one-fifth of cocoa trees and is associated with low yields. However, we think it unlikely that these ambitious plans will reach fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment.
Cameroon's and Nigeria's production targets will prove overambitious
After falling for the second consecutive crop year in 2016/17, cocoa production in Cameroon will remain weak during 2017/18-2018/19. Cuts in farmgate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". The fact that plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year have failed to materialise, with the area under cocoa cultivation rising by only around 3,000 ha since 2014, will severely hamper the expansion of the cocoa sector.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has slumped in recent years, and the country has slipped from being the world's fourth-largest producer to the sixth-largest (on a par with Brazil). Government initiatives designed to support farmers have not proved successful, with efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and increase the distribution of free seedlings floundering. With the country's mining and energy sector suffering from still-low inter-national oil prices, there is official acknowledgement that investment in raising cocoa production could generate greater foreign-exchange earnings, and the Ministry of Agriculture has recently outlined its ambitious goal of boosting cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. Its short-term goal is to lift cocoa production to 300,000-320,000 tonnes in 2017/18, with the medium-term target of raising output to 1m tonnes/year. However, problems with weak infrastructure, corruption, poor (and expensive) access to financing and weak implementation capacity will hamper these efforts.
Prospects are weak for Indonesia's cocoa sector
The authorities in Indonesia have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these are highly unlikely to materialise. Adverse weather, widely attributed to El Niño, hampered both the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 harvest, with cocoa output registering its third consecutive annual decline. On the assumption of more stable weather conditions, output should resume growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19, but at a forecast 320,000 tonnes at the end of the forecast period, cocoa output will remain weak by historical comparison. Indonesian firms are likely to rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from neighbouring Malaysia to meet domestic demand.

Strong potential for growth in Latin America will not be realised in 2018-19
Agriculture in Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, was affected by El Niño; in Brazil the main cocoa-producing regions reported drought conditions, and in Ecuador El Niño arrived late but continued for longer than usual. However, with better weather conditions, output is estimated to have recovered firmly in both countries in 2016/17. Structurally, there is scope for both countries to lift cocoa output as manufacturers look to boost investment in the region in an attempt to diversify production away from West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. However, some of this investment will be slow to materialise, as global prices remain depressed amid excess supply, which will act as a brake on growth potential.
Stocks and prices
We expect the global cocoa market to remain in surplus during the forecast period, but for the surplus to narrow from an estimated 402,000 tonnes in 2016/17 to 194,000 tonnes in 2017/18 and 98,000 tonnes in 2018/19. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that cocoa production will remain higher than consumption by some margin. Tepid demand growth makes a return to a market deficit unlikely during the forecast period. Stocks are forecast to exceed 2m tonnes at the end of the 2018/19 season, which is very high by historical comparison. Moreover, there is potential for stocks to rise even more strongly; Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have started discussions about how to bolster global market prices, and are considering stockpiling part of their output.

Supply concerns will support prices, despite subdued demand growth
After remaining high for much of 2014-16, at around US$3,000/tonne, cocoa prices plummeted between December 2016 and late April 2017, to less than US$1,900/tonne. Although prices have recovered somewhat, they averaged less than US$2,000/tonne each month from May-September. We see little prospect of a recovery in average prices, owing to the global supply glut. We forecast an average annual price of US$1,975/tonne in 2018 (a 2.1% year-on-year fall) and US$1,955/tonne in 2019.

Coffee
Demand
Following estimated growth of 1.9% in 2016/17, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global coffee consumption to expand by a similar rate of 2% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. Coffee-importing countries (mainly developed economies) account for around two-thirds of global coffee consumption, and after a weak 2015/16 are showing signs of firmer demand on the back of stronger underlying economic conditions. Notwithstanding ongoing monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers, domestic demand is expected to remain firm, supporting coffee consumption. In coffee-producing countries (many of which are emerging markets), consumption growth is forecast to average 2.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. This is slightly weaker than in recent years, reflecting relatively tepid demand growth in Brazil (which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption, owing to the sheer size of its domestic market). Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China. Although we expect China's GDP growth rate to slow from 2018, the deceleration will be concentrated in the investment and industrial sectors, and we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, meaning that there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth. However, coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic coffee demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global consumption growth.
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America and Europe, but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets. In some markets-including the US and China-the large coffee chains are increasingly moving towards prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although comprising a small market share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that, in volume terms, the instant and ground coffee market remains larger. Although sales growth of machines and capsules is showing signs of slowing, the coffee pod market will continue to provide important support for overall global coffee demand. Given that most pods contain either exclusively arabica beans or a high proportion of arabica with a small quantity of robusta, this will lift demand for arabica.
Coffee consumption growth in North America will increase steadily
US coffee consumption growth is forecast to average 2.6% a year in 2017/18-2018/19, with data from the US National Coffee Association showing that the percentage of people drinking coffee is rising rapidly (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017). Daily consumption is rising and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products (US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over the past two years). There are indications that long-term consumption growth may continue to rise, with the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee rising from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017, and demand growth among 18-24-year-olds also rising strongly.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers show a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations than other age brackets. We expect coffee consumption growth, which has been relatively steady at 2-3% in recent years, to pick up slightly, to 3.2%, in 2017/18.
Coffee consumption in Brazil is expected to falter
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. However, a sharp economic recession in 2015/16 hampered coffee consumption growth, which fell to 0.8%. After recovering to an estimated 1.5% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption to average 1.2% per year in 2017/18-2018/19. Although underlying economic growth is expected to pick up, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment, rising fuel prices and higher inflation, which will all drag on disposable income.
Fairly firm coffee consumption growth is expected in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia (and the fourth-largest in the world), with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by an estimated 2.8% in 2016/17, we expect coffee consumption growth to rise by an average of 2.5% a year in 2017/18 and 2018/19. This growth will be driven by coffee sales in convenience stores, given that the number of coffee shops is falling. In South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with coffee imports more than trebling between 2006 and 2016 and the number of coffee shops increasing even more rapidly. Although we forecast somewhat weaker growth in coffee consumption in 2017/18-2018/19, at an annual average of around 3% the pace of growth will remain firm.
Coffee consumption in China and India-currently both small consumers-will continue to grow. Much of the growth in Chinese coffee consumption will be in the out-of-home sector, reflecting the rising popularity of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres. A significant share of the new stores opened by Starbucks in 2016 were in Asia, with this trend continuing in 2017. The company now runs 2,800 outlets in 130 Chinese cities (nearly 600 in Shanghai alone, Starbucks' largest presence in a single city), up from 2,300 last October, and is planning to have 5,000 stores open by 2021. We expect an economic slowdown in China in 2018, but the deceleration will be less marked than previously forecast and will be concentrated in the construction and industrial sectors. Given that we expect average income levels to continue to rise steadily, we believe that there is little risk of a fall in coffee demand growth in the 2017/18-2018/19 forecast period.
Following a recent rapid expansion of the out-of-home sector in India, driven by comparatively low consumer price inflation, rising disposable income and favourable demographics (around one-half of the population is aged under 25), we expect a consolidation in 2018-19, with coffee consumption growth of around 3.5% per year. Meanwhile, south-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, although demand is increasing rapidly in certain countries (mainly coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam), and rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia and recently opened its first store in Vietnam.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee (which generally use the robusta variety) in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger for robusta beans than for the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.

Supply
After falling by an estimated 0.8% in the 2016/17 crop year (October-September), as adverse weather related to the El Niño weather phenomenon undermined the development of beans in Asia, coffee production is forecast to recover in 2017/18, rising by 1.3%. Production in Brazil-the world's largest producer-is forecast to fall as the biennial crop alternates between higher- and lower-producing years (2017/18 is an "off-season" crop year). However, this will be offset by firmer output growth in most other producing countries. Global coffee production growth is expected to be much stronger in 2018/19, at 4.6%, as Brazil's crop shifts to an "on-season" year.
We envisage a growing concentration of coffee production among the world's largest producers. Currently, a large number of countries (around 70) produce coffee, but the smaller producers have been struggling as a result of low world prices and rising overheads. In many of these countries, where coffee is not a particularly important area of the economy, farmers wield less power and are less likely to secure government support than in leading producers. Partly as a result, we expect coffee output in "other" countries to decline from 8.3m 60-kg bags in 2015/16 to 7.8m bags in 2018/19. Output in these countries-which fall outside the world's top 17 producers-will account for 5% of global production in 2018/19, compared with a peak of 8.8% in 2009/10.
Improved prospects for a recovery in coffee production in Brazil
In Brazil, by far the world's largest producer, prospects for the off-season 2017/18 crop year are fairly strong, and we expect only a moderate fall in production, to 50m bags. Although adverse weather in mid-2016-including drought in some areas and irregular rainfall in others-raised concerns that beans might be damaged ahead of the harvest, recent weather has been more supportive, and both quality and quantity of beans have been good. Moreover, the still-weak local currency is continuing to provide an incentive to growers.
The 2018/19 crop year remains some way off, with coffee bushes only just beginning to flower, so output projections remain highly speculative. Local commentators have stated that they believe that there is potential for a bumper crop in 2018/19, with some even suggesting that output of up to 60m bags is possible, which would represent a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). We expect coffee production to rise and we currently forecast output of 54m bags. Although weather conditions have been supportive in most places, some coffee-producing states have seen below-average rainfall, which is likely to hamper more rapid production growth.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to recover from a severe drought
In Vietnam, the worst drought in three decades hampered production in 2016/17, and we estimate that coffee output dropped by 12%. Assuming that weather conditions stabilise for the 2017/18 crop, there is scope for a rebound in Vietnam's coffee output; we forecast production of 27m bags, implying growth of 6.7%, followed by 3% growth (to 27.8m bags) in 2018/19. The authorities remain pessimistic about the medium-term prospects for production, forecasting coffee output to stabilise or decline slightly. However, government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop, will support firmer output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically high. In addition, firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will encourage growers.
Output from Mexico and Central America will slip in 2017/18
A severe outbreak of coffee rust, followed by El Niño, inflicted damage on coffee plantations in Mexico and Central America, and hampered production during three successive crop years, from 2013/14 until 2015/16. However, recent production and export data are much more positive, pointing towards a solid recovery in 2016/17. We estimate that coffee production rose by 12.2%, an upward revision from 9.5% previously, reflecting signs of stronger-than-anticipated output growth in Honduras. Nonetheless, there are reports that coffee rust is returning to some areas in the region, which could threaten output in 2017/18. Purchases of fungicides and fertiliser will help to prop up yields, but we nevertheless forecast a fall in coffee production of just under 2% in 2017/18. Assuming that coffee rust does not spread significantly and that weather conditions remain favourable, we forecast coffee production to grow by 3.9% in 2018/19.
Colombian production is set to continue to rise
Coffee production in Colombia has risen steadily in recent years, with recently released data from the local authorities indicating that output reached a 24-year high of 14.6m bags in 2016/17. Prospects for 2017/18 are uncertain. The structural underpinnings of the sector are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes. In addition, efforts are being made to increase productivity, with recent additional planting in existing plantations aiming to raise average production per hectare, which at 18 bags per hectare in 2016 was much lower than in other large growers (27 bags per hectare in Brazil and 35 bags per hectare in Vietnam). However, recent cloudy weather conditions are affecting flowering on coffee bushes; if this continues, the crop yield will be hampered. For the time being, we project coffee production growth of 3.4% in 2017/18, but will monitor this closely in the coming months. In 2018/19 production should start to benefit from a 2016 peace agreement between the government and the left-wing FARC rebels, as coffee cultivation will increase in previously isolated areas of the country (the government has speculated that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as a result). We forecast coffee production growth of 4.6% in 2018/19, to 15.8m bags.

In Indonesia coffee production is recovering, but remains weak overall
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector-which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil-have been completely derailed. El Niño brought excessive dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the 2016/17 harvest, when output fell by an estimated 18%. However, exports have recently begun to recover owing to more supportive weather conditions, providing momentum heading into the 2017/18 season, when we expect production to rise by 5.9%. We expect production growth of 4.7% in 2018/19, but at just 11.2m bags output will remain low by historical comparison.
Stocks and prices
Global stocks are forecast to fall throughout 2017/18-2018/19 as the market remains in deficit and as producers continue to sell some of their old stocks in order to take advantage of the relatively weak local currencies against the US dollar. However, exporting countries have less scope for further extensive sales, since stocks have already been run down substantially (stocks in importing countries have risen as a result). Even assuming some continued sales of stocks, the market deficit is still forecast to be large. By end-2018/19 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 31.9m bags, from an estimated 41.1m bags in September 2016, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

After slumping again in 2017, arabica prices are set to rise in 2018
Although arabica coffee prices rose by an average of 2.4% in 2016, prices fell sharply during November-December, from US$1.97/lb in early November to US$1.55/lb at the end of the year. After a partial recovery to close to US$1.70/lb in January, arabica prices fell steadily over the first half of 2017, before stabilising at US$1.45-1.50/lb in the third quarter. Given that it appears likely that the global market will be in deficit in 2016/17, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often due to a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices.
In recent weeks, speculation about bumper production in Brazil has kept prices low. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock in order to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand going forwards.
We believe that speculation about the 2018/19 harvest in Brazil will keep prices suppressed next year and forecast an average coffee price of US$1.53/lb in 2018. This is in line with recent developments in futures markets, with coffee for December 2017 delivery trading at well below US$1.30/lb. Given the underlying fundamentals and the likelihood that the next "off-season" in Brazil (2019/20) will hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery of prices, to an average US$1.66/lb.
Tighter supplies of robusta beans and firm Asian demand will support prices
Prices for cheaper robusta have fallen slightly since January, but have not seen the same sell-off as arabica beans, reflecting concerns about the supply of robusta beans in the context of disappointing weather conditions in Vietnam and Indonesia. Despite a sharp slide in prices in late April, from US$1.08/lb to 95 US cents/lb in the space of a week-as hedge funds liquidated their positions on the perception that robusta prices were extremely high-prices subsequently recovered quickly, trading at an average US$1.03/lb in the third quarter. We expect prices to average US$1/lb in 2018 and US$1.04/lb in 2019, underpinned by growing Asian con-sumption.

Maize
Demand
Maize is the most consumed (and produced) grain in the world, with total annual demand now in excess of 1bn tonnes/year (t/y). It is a versatile grain, with around 60% of the total used for animal feed, almost 30% for industrial processing (mainly fuel ethanol and starch) and the rest consumed directly as food or seed, or lost through waste. After a period of spectacular growth, demand for maize-based biofuels is now increasing more slowly, even though overall levels of consumption are still setting new records each year. However, following reports about China's plans for a massive expansion of its own fuel ethanol sector, world use for biofuels could potentially rise sharply from current levels over the medium term. Maize is the primary energy source in compound feed mixes, and with ample supplies predicted across the world, it is well placed to meet predicted gains in demand in meat-exporting countries, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where consumption of animal protein continues to expand. Maize is by far the dominant feed grain in much of the world, with annual consumption typically more than four times that of wheat, the second most widely consumed feed cereal. In 2017/18 The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global demand to rise by 1.9% year on year to 1.03bn tonnes, with stronger uptake expected across the animal feed, industrial and food sectors. A similar trend is projected for 2018/19, with overall consumption rising by an additional 1.9%, to 1.05bn tonnes.
World feed demand will rise by 2% in 2017/18
World demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient, which, combined with other rations, can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. Overall use, however, depends on availabilities and price relationships with other grains-mainly wheat-as well as high-protein oilmeals. A multitude of other factors can also have a direct impact on feed demand in any particular year, with producers having to consider pasture conditions and availability, as well as desired livestock weight, the economics of the meat industry and feed efficiency ratios. In 2017/18 we expect global growth in use of maize for livestock feed to slow to around 2%, down from almost 7% in the previous season. Although firmer demand for maize in complex feed rations is anticipated in China, Brazil, Iran, Egypt, the EU and India, discretionary on-farm feeding may drop back amid smaller predicted harvests in some countries, including the US. Predictions for the 2018/19 period remain provisional and will depend on future maize availabilities and pricing relative to alternative feeds. However, with the upward trend in world meat production unlikely to falter, a further increase in maize feed demand is likely, provisionally pegged at a record 595m tonnes. Gains are again likely to be tied to expansions in Asia and Latin America, but with an expected rise in the US too.
Use for fuel ethanol is at a record high, but growth is slowing
A substantial amount of maize is processed for use in a multitude of food, beverage and industrial applications, including corn oil, starches, sweeteners and ethanol. About 20 years ago approximately 70m tonnes of maize was used for industrial processing worldwide, equivalent to about 12% of overall use. Following the massive, mainly policy-driven, expansion in the global biofuels sector, world consumption surged between 2005/06 and 2009/10, expanding at an average rate of 16% per year over that time. Although subsequent growth has been comparatively much slower, industrial use has increased to successive records in each of the past five years. In 2017/18 processing is forecast to account for 27% of total consumption, rising by 4m tonnes year on year, to 286m tonnes, more than four times more than two decades earlier. Consumption in the following year is provisionally placed at 3m tonnes higher, at 289m tonnes. The US is by far the leading processor, with demand projected at almost 172m tonnes this year, including 12.5m tonnes for high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), 9.4m tonnes for glucose, 6.5m tonnes for starch and 3.8m tonnes for beverage alcohol. While consolidating somewhat in recent years, the amount of maize used to produce HFCS has declined from earlier peaks, partly reflecting consumer health concerns. Fuel ethanol is now the largest single component of US demand, with processors expected to use close to 140m tonnes of maize in 2017/18, 4m tonnes more than that used for feed/residual and compared to projected reports of less than 50m tonnes. Ethanol now accounts for about 10% of finished motor gasoline in the US, blending in excess of 15bn gallons per year. Although ethanol exports will be a useful outlet, infrastructure constraints mean than future growth prospects will probably be limited.
China announces plans to boost ethanol production
Years of supply and demand imbalances in China have led to a massive surplus, with stocks soaring to an unprecedented level in recent years. Over-production was mainly linked to a now discontinued official stockpiling scheme, under which farmers in the largest maize provinces were able to sell unlimited amounts into state reserves at guaranteed minimum prices. At the same time, cheaper feed grain imports flooded into southern consuming regions, choking off demand for locally produced maize. Authorities are now working hard to unwind part of these burdensome stocks. Under a plan jointly announced by 15 ministries and commissions in September, the government is seeking a massive expansion of the biofuel sector, targeting the blending of 10% ethanol (E10) into all automotive petrol by 2020. As well as mopping up surplus maize, the move is seen part of broader efforts to reduce China's carbon footprint. Although China is already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels, fuel ethanol is currently used only in a few provinces and accounts for around 1% of overall fuel consumption. The new plans are far more ambitious than those proposed last year, when the government announced its aim to double ethanol production by 2020. If E10 plans are fully implemented, an additional 35-40m tonnes of maize would be required as a feedstock each year.
Processing plants are already being built
China's targets are very ambitious, and it remains to be seen whether they can be achieved in such a short window. However, some local analysts recently reported that more than ten new fuel-ethanol plants are already planned to begin operating in 2018. Depending on how much processing capacity would need to be added, the initiative would require significant investment, tax incentives and probably additional subsidies. The local government in Heilongjiang, the largest maize province, has already issued guidelines on sharply boosting production of maize-based ethanol and high-quality starches.
China's maize stocks are likely to be larger than previously thought
Calls for such a steep and sustained increase in China's maize consumption suggest that local inventories could be much larger than we had previously expected. Our supply and demand estimates for the past decade have therefore been revised, with forecasts for feed use across this period lowered by an average of 18m tonnes per year, equivalent to around 10% of total annual consumption. With so much uncertainty about levels of feed demand in almost every country, such revisions are occasionally necessary when new data come to light. However, given the sheer size of its grain economy, any such changes for China can appear very large. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the underlying trend is unchanged from before, and with so much of China's grain economy operating quite separately from the global market, these revisions do not have any wider price implications. We forecast China's overall maize demand to rise by 3.8% in 2017/18, and by a further 5.8% in 2018/19, as maize use in industrial processing begins to accelerate.

Supply
World maize supplies (production plus carryover stocks) have increased to record highs in recent seasons, topping 1bn tonnes each year since 2011/12. Encouraged by high market prices, production gains have stemmed from increases in plantings, as well as improved yields, with growers using new seed varieties, fertilisers and better farming practices to great effect. After surging by an estimated 10.7% in 2016/17, global output is projected to drop by 4.1% in 2017/18, to just over 1bn tonnes. Following earlier downgrades for Ukraine and the EU, we forecast production to fall in year-on-year terms in all major maize-growing countries. Nevertheless, total maize production would still be 4.2% above the five-year average. Boosted by ample carryovers from 2016/17, global supplies are still likely to remain comfortable, especially in the major exporting countries, where traders are likely to compete hard for available business. Forecasts for 2018/19 remain highly provisional, especially in the southern hemisphere, and will be subject to revision in the coming months. Overall, we expect global output to rise by around 1% in that season as good underlying demand and slightly tighter stocks encourage planting in some producers.
US output will drop in 2017/18, but by a lower margin than expected
The 2017/18 season has been quite unusual in the US, with many forecasters underestimating the size of this year's crop. Weather during the spring and early summer was mixed, and included periods of drought in some western growing states as well as excessive rainfall further east. Moreover, dry and hot conditions during July, usually the key determinant of Midwest yields, were thought likely to have resulted in widespread damage. A sustained drop in crop condition ratings across the season-with the proportion of plants rated good or excellent, and thus expected to yield at or above trend levels, down from the recent average-had reinforced this negative outlook. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) took a much more optimistic view of the market, however. Its survey-based projections for the third-highest yields on record drew criticism from some quarters but, with combines now rolling, anecdotal yield reports have so far shown good results, with many farmers confirming better than expected output. The latest hybrids and varieties appear to be performing well, even under sub-optimal conditions. Advances in seed technology may also have been amplified by improved farming practices, including quicker seeding and more efficient use of fertilisers. With the harvest around 17% finished by the start of October, we have revised up our crop estimate to 360.3m tonnes (354m tonnes previously), although this is still 6% lower than the previous season's record outturn. There has been some recent chatter about the potential for a modest increase in sowings for the next crop, to be harvested in late 2018. Although prices nearer the time will shape final planting decisions, some growers are expected to rotate soybean area back into maize, reversing the trend seen in 2016/17. Assuming a 1% rise in planted area, output is forecast to increase fractionally, to 361.8m tonnes.
Southern hemisphere supplies will flood the market in the near term
The southern hemisphere maize production timetable is completely different from that north of the equator, with the earliest sowings beginning at least six months later on in the year. With much more known about the northern hemisphere prospects at that time, farmers in South America and parts of southern Africa are therefore better able to assess the market outlook in the run-up to planting. Should, for example, US crops be badly affected by a summer drought in a certain year, producers in Brazil and Argentina would be able to react to the inevitable spike in prices by upping maize plantings and looking to capture additional export demand. Although this might also be true for US growers assessing the outlook for South America before planting their next crops in the following year, the US is the price-setter and key market driver.
Southern hemisphere harvests are expected to be smaller in 2017/18
Planting of 2017/18 maize crops began in September in some parts of South America, with fieldwork stretching through until February. The heavy supply outlook and current weak market prices suggest that a pullback in area is likely. Assuming a normalisation of yields, cumulative production in the three top exporters could decline by about 8%, to 143.5m tonnes. The price outlook in Brazil is especially weak, with average local prices down by more than 40% year on year. Potentially better returns from soybeans mean that more area in the south of the country is likely to be diverted to oilseeds. As safrinha (second crop) maize will not be sown until soybeans are harvested in February, prices nearer the time will determine exactly how much is sown. We expect the outturn to fall to 91m tonnes in 2017/18, a decrease of 7% year on year. Similarly, a slump in South African prices means that sown area is likely to decline later this year, especially if exporters cannot dispose of the large surplus. Based on average yields, the crop could drop by a quarter, to 12.5m tonnes. The situation in Argentina is somewhat different. Producers there, still encouraged by the farm-friendly policies of the Macri administration, are expected to boost plantings, with production down by only 1m tonnes from the previous season, at 40m tonnes. The outlook for 2018/19 maize crops south of the equator is highly provisional, with sowings still 18 months away in some areas. We currently expect a modest expansion in South American crops but another static year in South African output.
Although Canada remains a small producer, output is trending higher
Although Canada is still a relatively small producer, consumer and exporter of maize, a number of interesting trends have developed in recent seasons. Annual production averaged almost 13m tonnes in the past five years, up from just over 11m tonnes in the previous five-year period. This expansion has turned Canada from a net importer of maize to a net exporter, while at the same time meeting increased demand from local ethanol producers. Despite far from perfect cropping weather so far this season, 2017/18 output is still expected to rise by 8%, to around 14.3m tonnes. Most maize is produced in the east of the country, where, similar to the US, the use of genetically modified varieties is widespread. However, the development of new maize hybrids, better suited to local growing conditions, has also allowed area to rise in non-traditional Western producing provinces. As technology improves further to better adapt to the relatively short summer and occasionally cool overnight temperatures, further expansion is expected in 2018-19, with more prairie farmers likely to include maize in their crop rotations. However, the required investment in machinery could be a limiting factor, especially if prices stay below earlier peaks.

Stocks and prices
We have raised our estimate of global maize stocks substantially, to 326m tonnes in 2017/18 (206m tonnes previously), following a detailed reassessment of China's maize supply and demand numbers over the past decade. Maize production in China is trending lower, and with consumption seen rising strongly in the years ahead it became clear that our previous forecast was too conservative and would have resulted in the depletion of China's stocks in just a few years. With feed use adjusted lower from 2011/12 onwards, projections for China's stocks are lifted across the whole period and are now seen at 201m tonnes at the end of 2017/18, a figure much closer to that circulating in the local press. We now expect China to account for 62% of total world stocks (40% previously). Yet with so much uncertainty about the size, location and quality of its stocks, many analysts prefer to exclude China when modelling world inventories. Combined stocks in the four main maize exporters (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and the US) are forecast to remain above the recent average in 2017/18, at a total of 75.1m tonnes, down by 1.5% year on year-with more than three quarters of this (59.8m tonnes) concentrated in the US. A relatively sharp drop is predicted in 2018/19, to 309m tonnes. Although exporter stocks will also tighten further, overall market supplies will remain at comfortable levels.

China's stock estimate is revised sharply higher
China's grain stocks have long been considered a state secret, with all parts of the grain balance sheet quite notional and based on very limited information. Sometimes the assumptions are proven to be incorrect, as highlighted by new information or a change in underlying market conditions. The USDA and other agencies last made major revisions to their own Chinese estimates in 2001, when the cumulative forecast for wheat, maize and rice stocks was more than tripled as it became apparent that inventories were much larger than previously assumed due to years of feed use being overestimated. Although our revised stock forecast diverges from those of the USDA and other major forecasting bodies, it brings stocks in China much closer to the levels that have been widely reported in local press in recent years, including figures quoted by key policy advisers and other Communist Party officials. However, the fact remains that these supplies are held primarily as a food security measure and will never be made available on the world market. Indeed, with China only a small importer, its domestic stock levels are unlikely to have a major impact on global prices. Moreover, the underlying trend for Chinese maize stocks remains unchanged, with stocks having built up since 2007/08, before tightening in recent seasons. We expect stocks to be drawn down further in 2018-19 as the government seeks to boost domestic consumption, particularly in the biofuels industry.
Prices are unlikely to show any significant growth in 2018-19
World maize markets have eased slightly in recent months, averaging more than 10% lower year on year in early October. Although US export prices were initially pulled higher by concerns about worse than normal Midwest crop conditions, early summer gains have eroded, as participants shed speculative long positions on signs that final yields would outperform earlier expectations. Light seasonal harvest pressure also weighed on markets in September as newly harvested supplies added to bountiful US stockpiles. Barring a late-season severe frost, the US crop is widely expected to be one of the biggest on record and supplies looks set to remain ample thorough the next season. Export prices in South America remained weak, hovering close to an eight-year low in Argentina, as traders worked hard to secure sales. However, with large customers well aware of the possibility of further price weakness, many have been reluctant to extend coverage. Despite some chatter about a potential La Niña weather shock in South America over the next six months, maize market fundamentals currently point to a low price environment. Given ample global stocks and easy feedgrain availabilities, we expect prices to remain low in 2018-19. With limited growth in consumption and trade, prices will begin to rise from the fourth quarter of 2017, with values likely to stay well below recent peaks.

Palm oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global palm oil consumption grew by just 2.3% in 2016/17, to a total of 63.8m tonnes, despite its lower price compared with other oils. This compares unfavourably with annual average growth of 5.4% over the last five years. On current assessments, consumption growth in 2017/18 and 2018/19 looks likely to improve, but to remain below recent averages. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are looking for market opportunities, with the biodiesel market in China the most likely to absorb significant quantities of palm oil. However, it is likely only to offset declining consumption in the EU. The development of the biodiesel market in India, Malaysia and Indonesia could also contribute to stronger consumption growth.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
Following a slow start to the 2016/17 season, Indian palm oil imports have increased each month since March. Recent import levels are consistent with our estimate for Indian consumption of 9.3m tonnes in 2016/17. Changes in the duties applied to imported palm oil will weigh on demand in 2017/18, and we expect below-average consumption growth that season, of 3.8%. Strong overall GDP growth in 2018/19 will help to support demand for palm oil, which we expect to increase by 4.5% year on year, to over 10m tonnes.
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post decent growth in 2016/17 and 2017/18
Prospects for palm oil demand in Indonesia appear slightly more positive than we had initially thought. In addition to rising food use, palm oil is likely to become increasingly competitive against mineral oil as a base for biodiesel. The recent implementation by the EU of reduced duties for Argentinian biodiesel is expected to be followed by a similar reduction for Indonesian biodiesel. This good news is partially offset by the application by the US of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Indonesia (as well as Argentina). Nonetheless, we have revised up our forecast for Indonesian palm oil consumption to an aveage of 3.8% per year in 2017/18-2018/19 (3% previously). Overall consumption in 2018/19 should comfortably exceed 10m tonnes.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by competition from soybean oil
Buying interest from China at the start of the 2016/17 was strong but has since declined. Recent import levels have been below normal levels. Higher local crushing of imported soybean for meal has resulted in soybean oil being available at more competitive prices. As a result, we now estimate that palm oil consumption fell by 4.5% in 2016/17 (2.2% previously), to just over 5m tonnes. Looking ahead, there is some hope of a sustained recovery in instant noodle production; apparently, higher quality product has rekindled consumer interest. More significantly, the planned expansion of biodiesel use, part of a broader biofuels policy, has the potential to absorb large quantities of palm oil. We remain cautious about growth in China's palm oil demand in 2017/18 and 2018/19, given recent declines. An expansion of biofuels use underpins our forecast for steady demand growth, averaging 3.7% per year over the forecast period, to reach a total of 5.4m tonnes in the 2018/19 season.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
In 2016/17 the edible market for palm oil in the EU is likely to be broadly stable. Our estimate for palm oil consumption in 2016/17 is increased to 7.2m tonnes (7.1m tonnes previously), on a par with the previous two seasons. Lower palm oil prices should, in principle, stimulate additional consumption in 2017/18 and 2018/19. However, the use of palm oil in the biodiesel sector faces increased competition from recycled oils and fats, especially in the Netherlands and Italy, although this may be partially offset by higher use in Spain. An EU resolution that seeks to reduce palm oil use in the biodiesel sector on sustainability grounds also hangs over future consumption prospects. Biodiesel consumption in the EU is expected to increase over the next two years, reflecting changes in incorporation mandates. However, other feedstocks are likely to be the main beneficiaries of this growth. Therefore, we expect EU consumption to remain fairly flat on average during the forecast period.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia faces challenges
Malaysian palm oil consumption was hampered in 2017 by delays in implementing biodiesel incorporation mandates. We have made a small reduction in our estimate of 2016/17 consumption to reflect the difficulties of the biodiesel sector. The government continues its efforts to get the B10 mandate accepted by automobile manufacturers. However, we have also made small reductions in our forecasts of consumption in 2017/18 and 2018/19 to reflect the sluggish growth in biodiesel uptake.
Prospects for palm oil consumption in other countries are broadly positive
The top five consumers account for less than 55% of global demand, and a large number of other countries also consume palm oil. Consumption growth in these countries has been buoyant, but has slowed during the second half of 2016/17. A number of these countries are the target of palm oil exporters, especially in Africa and the Middle East. The largest of these other consumers, Pakistan, is showing steady growth in palm oil consumption. Attempts to encourage local oilseeds production have been largely unsuccessful since neither sunflowerseed nor rapeseed fit in well with other, more profitable crops. By 2018/19, Pakistan's palm oil consumption should be at almost 3m tonnes, similar to expected consumption in Malaysia.

Supply
We estimate that global palm oil production surged ahead by 12.2% in 2016/17, to a total of 65.4m tonnes. However, the rate of area increase is slowing, and yield growth is inhibited by the slow rate of tree replacement, especially in Malaysia. In 2017/18 we expect global palm oil production growth to be closer to the historical average, at 5.1%, which would push the total outturn to 68.7m tonnes in that season. The growth rate is likely to slow further in 2018/19 as the impact of stressed trees combines with a further slowdown in mature area growth. We expect output to be up by only 1% to 69.4m tonnes.
Yields in Indonesia are slowly recovering from the 2015/16 drought
Indonesia's palm oil output growth in 2016/17 continues to exceed expectations. At an estimated 36m tonnes, output is more than 15% higher than the drought-affected 2015/16 season. Yields have the potential to rise further in 2017/18, albeit at a slower rate, to over 37m tonnes. Although the rate of planting is slowing, the higher area in 2018/19 will offset any slowdown in yields from tree stress. We expect output of at least 38.4m tonnes.
Malaysian production is set to return to 2013/14 peak by 2017/18
Malaysia's recorded palm oil production in August was well below expectations, and even below the total recorded in July. Consequently, our estimate of the 2016/17 season's output is lower, at just over 19m tonnes (19.2m tonnes previously). Persistent labour shortages, the age profile of the trees and lower extraction rates all suggest only slow growth in output in 2017/18. In some regions, fertiliser uptake is estimated to be sub-optimal. For 2017/18 we retain our forecast that output will reach 20.2m tonnes, up by 6.2%. The factors mentioned above are unlikely to be resolved in the near term, although there appears to be some movement on the recruitment of foreign workers. For 2018/19 we expect output to remain fairly flat year on year, at about 20.1m tonnes. Given the difficulties of finding new land for planting, growth in Malaysian output relies on replacing ageing trees with younger, higher-yielding trees. The rate of replanting in recent years has been too low to prevent a slump in yields. To date there is little evidence to suggest a change in this pattern.
Thailand will register robust production growth in 2016/17-2017/18
For Thailand, the third-largest producer, we estimate that production will exceed 2.1m tonnes in 2016/17. Higher output is putting pressure on local prices of palm fruit. Some local sources suggest that prices are below the costs of production, inhibiting the use of inputs to stimulate yields. We expect an increase in the mature area to ensure continued growth in palm oil output in 2017/18-2018/19, albeit at a relatively slow rate, reflecting the difficulties of securing new land for planting. The slow growth in palm oil output is expected to result in a lower target for biodiesel use in Thailand. We expect Colombian output to show steady growth over the forecast period as its mature area expands. Recent yields have largely been above year-earlier levels, and returns to the crop have been favourable. A higher biodiesel incorporation rate mandate should also help to maintain interest in the crop.

Stocks and prices
Recorded palm oil stocks in Malaysia at the end of August showed a further substantial increase month on month, and remained above year-earlier levels. However, the increase was less than expected by many analysts, and it had a positive impact on market values. Our own estimates suggest that stocks at the end of the 2016/17 season will be adequate but below the historical average. We expect the market surplus to widen markedly in 2017/18, on the back of robust global production growth. A surplus, albeit smaller than that of 2017/18, is also expected in 2018/19. Stock levels could rise to an unprecedented 78 days of consumption by the end of the 2018/19 season.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further in 2018
In September both physical and futures prices for palm oil showed surprisingly large gains. The unexpected fall in Malaysian palm oil output and the comparatively low current stock levels appear to have been the main reasons for this increase. Futures prices have now retreated from the peak level recorded in mid-September. We consider that these price gains are likely to be only temporary, given the scale of the prospective surplus for the 2017/18 season. However, there remain significant uncertainties over the prospective increases in production, and markets are likely to remain firm until evidence of the production growth, and the consequent stock increases, is more firmly established. We consider that price falls in the final quarter of 2017 will be small, but will be larger in each of the quarters during 2018. By the end of 2018 palm oil is expected to be below US$600/tonne, with further falls in 2019.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global rapeseed oil consumption fell by 7% year on year in 2016/17. We expect the same factors that constrained demand growth that season-namely rapeseed availability and competition with other oils-to weigh on consumption in 2017/18. Prospects for demand in China have been especially affected by lower availability estimates. As a result, we forecast global demand to contract by a further 0.7% in 2017/18, to less than 25m tonnes. We expect demand to improve in 2018/19, rising by 4.9%, on the assumption of improved availability and a further small drawdown in stocks.
EU consumption in 2016/17 will be limited by availability
EU consumption in 2016/17 was constrained by the availability of supply. Crop availabilities improved towards the end of that season, and as a result we now estimate that EU rapeseed oil demand contracted by 2.1% in 2016/17 (2.4% previously). However, at less than 10m tonnes, consumption was lower than in the previous three seasons. The 10m-tonne mark is unlikely to be breached in the 2017/18 season. Given current offtake levels, we now forecast EU demand to contract by 1.8% that year (2.6% previously). Nonetheless, potential usage is limited by the expected resumption of biodiesel imports from Argentina and possibly from Indonesia in mid-2018, which will weigh on consumption in the latter part of that season. There is an upside risk, however, that higher biodiesel exports to the US and minor upward revisions in mineral oil prices could offset this competition. Better local availability could push demand up in 2018/19, although the sluggish increase in mineral oil prices remains a downside risk.
Demand in China will be aided in 2016/17 by the release of reserve stocks
In China it appears that consumption in 2016/17 was marginally higher than previously estimated. Drawdowns of rapeseed stocks helped to support consump-tion of 5.6m tonnes (5.5m tonnes previously), although this remains well below the previous season. It is unlikely that a further drawdown of stocks can be used to maintain consumption in 2017/18. The downgrading of local production estimates means that usage is likely to fall further in 2017/18. We forecast Chinese consumption to drop by nearly 5% in that season, to 5.4m tonnes; even this level will require a significant increase in rapeseed imports for local crushing, and the maintenance of recent levels of rapeseed oil imports. The forecast is vulnerable to any change in price differentials, especially between rapeseed oil and palm oil.
India's consumption will rebound in 2016/17 in line with local availability
In India, competition from imported oils was strong during the 2016/17 season despite good local supplies. We estimate that consumption climbed by nearly 10% in 2016/17 to reach nearly 2.4m tonnes. Although India has struggled to achieve a sustained increase in its rapeseed oil output, global availability should be sufficient to help to keep import costs down and therefore support consumption growth in 2017/18. An acceleration in real GDP growth over the forecast period, to nearly 8% per year, will also support demand growth. We expect rapeseed oil consumption to increase by an average of 3% per year over 2017/18-2018/19, to over 2.5m tonnes each year. This forecast implies a significant increase in rapeseed oil imports to levels similar to the previous high of 2014/15.
Limited supplies will keep US and Japanese demand in check
Imports of rapeseed oil into the US continue to run ahead of earlier expectations. Coupled with improved domestic output, we expect consumption to have reached a record of over 2.6m tonnes in 2016/17. The recent application of anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia could stimulate additional demand for rapeseed oil as a feedstock during the forecast period. Overall, we expect US rapeseed oil consumption to expand by an average of 4.6% per year, to reach nearly 2.9m tonnes in the 2018/19 season. Several smaller consumers have switched away from rapeseed oil during 2016/17 as a result of its comparatively high price relative to other oils. Demand among these "other" consumers has fallen in 2016/17, but is expected to recover in 2017/18 and 2018/19.

Supply
Global rapeseed oil production declined for the third consecutive season in 2016/17, falling by 2.5% year on year to 24.7m tonnes. This is a downward revision from our previous forecast, of a 2.1% drop, owing to lower than expected production from China. We have also downgraded our outlook for 2017/18, when we expect global production to fall by 1.8% (0.7% previously) to 24.3m tonnes, the lowest level since 2010/11. Reductions in expected production in China and the EU will only be partially offset by higher estimates for Canada and India. Nonetheless, rapeseed remains an attractive crop to farmers and the 2018/19 area should expand. The impact of weather on yields is the major factor determining the size of the rapeseed harvest; normal yields would allow a significant jump in rapeseed oil output in 2018/19 as it recovers from several years of decline. We currently forecast growth of 6.8%, to 25.8m tonnes.
The EU rapeseed crop will recover only partially in 2017/18
The latest crush statistics suggest that 2016/17 EU rapeseed oil output will reach almost 10.2m tonnes, only marginally below the 2015/16 total. Prospects for rapeseed oil production in the following season have been helped by a further increase in the size of the 2017/18 rapeseed harvest. Higher estimates for crops in Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic States more than offset a slightly lower estimate for Germany. At 21.8m tonnes, production is set to be 1.4m tonnes higher than last season, but still well below the 24.3m tonnes harvested in 2014/15. Greater local availability will be needed to offset expected lower imports from Australia, which will have a dampening effect on rapeseed oil output that season. We forecast production to remain flat in 2017/18, at 10.2m tonnes, although some analysts put the total lower. Assuming a return to normal crop yields in 2018/19, we expect rapeseed oil production to approach the record output of 10.7m tonnes recorded in 2014/15.
Chinese production will fall in 2016/17
Chinese farmers have lost interest in rapeseed production, with other crops showing higher levels of profitability in the absence of government support. Recent data show that the 2017/18 planted area was below previous reports, and that yields were also disappointing. As a result, we estimate that the 2017/18 harvest will reach just 5m tonnes. China's rapeseed oil production increasingly relies on imported rapeseed/canola through the additional capacity located at ports. Yet, the smaller domestic crop will have an impact. We currently forecast 2017/18 rapeseed oil production to expand by just 1.8% (7.7% previously), to 3.7m tonnes. Given the deteriorating return on rapeseed cultivation, higher rapeseed oil production for the 2018/19 season will require yet more imports. We currently forecast oil output to expand by 7% that season, but at less than 4m tonnes, this is still down by more than 25% from the 2014/15 season.
Canada's 2016/17 harvest may be below expectations
At just shy of 4m tonnes, Canadian canola oil production in 2016/17 was easily a new record. A recent Statistics Canada report indicates that the 2017/18 canola harvest will also be record-setting, at over 19.7m tonnes. Better than expected yields have so far been achieved and farmers are reported to be ready sellers. The Canadian crush industry will, however, face strong competition for available supplies, especially considering the downgraded estimate for Australian production. The strongest competition will come from the US and China. Under these circumstances, we expect Canadian 2017/18 canola oil production to increase by a modest 0.6% in that season, to just over 4m tonnes. Canola remains an attractive crop to Canadian farmers, and we assume an expansion of the planted area in 2018/19 to levels similar to the 2012/13 record. Normal yields should allow canola oil output to rise by 3.7%, to 4.2m tonnes.
India's production is poised for a rebound in 2016/17
In India, 2016/17 rapeseed crushings have been inhibited by imported vegetable oils, despite a large local harvest. We have made a further small reduction in our estimate of 2016/17 rapeseed oil production. The recent decline in rapeseed prices may dampen enthusiasm for the crop in 2017/18, however, and local rapeseed output is unlikely to replicate the 2016/17 level. Despite this, we expect 2017/18 rapeseed oil production to match that of 2016/17 at around 2.1m tonnes.

Australian production is likely to fall in 2017/18 owing to dry conditions
Overly dry conditions have persisted in most of the main canola producing areas of Australia. For example, in Western Australia, the largest producing state, yields are expected to drop by as much as 35%, owing to the lack of rainfall. Overall, Australian production in 2017/18 is expected to reach less than 3m tonnes, well below the 4.4m tonnes harvested in 2016/17 and the lowest total since 2010/11. In Ukraine, harvesting of the winter rapeseed planted area is complete, with production confirmed at 2.1m tonnes. Winter plantings to date suggest a further increase in output in 2018/19.
Stocks and prices
The global rapeseed oil market will remain in deficit in 2016/17, for the third consecutive season. Stocks of both rapeseed and rapeseed oil (when measured against consumption) are well below normal levels, although still not at record lows. Another market deficit is expected in 2017/18, with oil stocks expected to drop to their lowest level. However, rapeseed stocks will remain available during 2017/18, and a potential acceleration in crush rates could help to ease pressure on rapeseed oil stocks. With the Canadian harvest so well advanced, the major uncertainty remains that of the Indian crop to be harvested in the February-April 2018 period. Our current projections suggest that the market will remain in deficit in the 2018/19 season. Depending on the outcome of the 2018/19 harvests, crush rates could increase but global consumption may need to be further rationed from current projected levels.

Low stocks will put upward pressure on prices from late 2017
In line with market tightening, physical prices of rapeseed oil continued to rise in September, although the increase was comparatively small. Canola futures prices eased during September, reflecting good progress with the harvest, although they began to rise again in early October. Given that stocks appear set to remain tight over the forecast period, sustained price rises are the most likely course for rapeseed oil prices. Price gains will be limited by the high availability of other oils. However, prices look set to be above US$900/tonne during 2018 with the potential to exceed US$1,000/tonne by the end of the 2018/19 season.

Rice
Demand
With human consumption of rice continuing to drive up overall use in Asia, where populations are rising, global rice usage is expected to reach a new high of 495m tonnes in 2017/18, up by almost 2% from the previous season. As in the past, relatively tiny volume increases are likely in other regions, such as Africa and South America. With respect to other components of demand, however, such as feed and industrial sectors, these are anticipated to contract. The outlook for the 2018/19 season is still uncertain, since it depends on factors that will remain unknown for quite some time, such as policy frameworks, local crop outcomes and import needs. As such, our projection of 501m tonnes rests on the assumption that annual consumption growth will return close to trend.
Trade in rice will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2017
Africa and Asia account for three-quarters of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. In Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, a significant share of demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. With buyers in those regions expected to remain active in the global market, trade is projected to continue to grow in the next two years, to reach 44.4m tonnes in 2019, which would be the largest volume on record. However, this is a downward revision from our previous forecast, of 45.1m tonnes, owing to the sharp rise in trade volumes in 2017 and the possibility that many importers will buy less in the coming years, owing to more comfortable domestic stocks. In addition, we believe that a portion of the increase in demand in 2017 was due to strong interest in Thai government reserves, especially among African importers.
China's needs are expected to be central to the rice trade in 2018-19
China is currently the world's leading buyer, with annual imports likely to be between 4.5m and 5m tonnes during the forecast period. Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines are set to be significant importers as they aim to maintain buffer reserves. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a significant share of total demand-mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies-is met by imports. Shipments to Africa are likely to rise in 2017/18-2018/19 after contracting in the two previous seasons, as economic growth improves slightly and international rice prices remain low.
China is by far the world's largest consumer of rice, accounting for about 30% of global demand. The bulk of national consumption is made up of locally produced rice, but in recent years China has also become the biggest importer of rice, mainly of high-quality broken types from Thailand and Vietnam. Prices for domestic long-grain milled rice still command hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China, supporting China's import demand.
Lower duties will encourage rice imports by Bangladesh in 2018-19
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. Three domestic crops are cut each year, namely the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July) and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs are met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market. Bangladesh importers and millers have sought to get tariffs reduced as a means of boosting imports, primarily from Thailand and India, with the latter typically the largest supplier in recent years. The country has recently entered into a long-term arrangement with Vietnam for up to 1m tonnes of imports per year until 2022. Trade reports have also highlighted the possibility of significant purchases from Myanmar.
The government is looking to boost rice imports to build reserves and rein in local prices after flash floods hit domestic output. To this end, the government announced in mid-2017 that the tariff applied to rice imports had been cut from 28% to 10% to boost purchases. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that imports in fiscal year 2017/18 (October-September) were likely to amount to 1.5m tonnes, the highest in many years, which will boost buffer stocks.
The Philippines may be a large buyer, as state reserves are historically low.
In the Philippines, stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in around a decade. In contrast, however, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain especially comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports progressed strongly over the course of the 2017, with the total for the first six months of the year at 530,000 tonnes, an 80% increase on the same period of 2016. With more imports expected throughout the rest of the year, arrivals are forecast to be 40% larger in 2017, at 1.4m tonnes. Purchases are likely to remain high in the following years.

Supply
We have revised down our forecast slightly for world rice output in 2017/18, to 487m tonnes (488.6m tonnes previously), translating into a year-on-year increase of just 0.3%. With limited prospects for an expansion of seeded area in China, by far the world's most important producer, output there is likely to again fall below its 2015/16 peak of 146m tonnes. Conversely, we assume that area increases in other parts of Asia, together with some improvement in yields, will boost output in those areas. The outlook for 2018/19 is highly provisional. Nonetheless, given that only a small expansion of paddy plantings is likely, an increase in global output will almost certainly be dependent on better yields. At 492m tonnes, the world outturn is projected to be up by 1.1% year on year. All of our scenarios assume continued state support to farmers in Asia and beneficial weather.
India's main agricultural crops are cultivated during two distinct seasons: kharif crops are sown between June and October and rabi crops in November-December. Kharif crops, of which rice is by far the most important, are rain-fed and therefore critically reliant on monsoon precipitation, which typically arrives in the southern state of Kerala in early June and lasts for about four months, accounting for 70% of the country's annual rains.
The 2017 monsoon was 5% below average, weighing slightly on output
In India, where the kharif-planting season is now finished, the area planted to paddy was slightly smaller year on year, but still fairly resilient compared with the average of recent seasons. The 2017 monsoon was around 5% below the long-term average; taking into account its impact on yield potential in some regions, as well as prospects for the winter-sown rabi crop, we project acreage to be broadly steady year on year. Accordingly, we have revised down slightly our forecast for full-year output in 2017/18, by 2m tonnes, to 108.5m tonnes, representing a small contraction year on year. Nevertheless, this should still ensure that availabilities for domestic use and exports are sufficiently comfortable to maintain each at high levels. In 2018/19 everything will again depend on the pattern of the monsoon, which will begin around June 1st 2018. If it is beneficial, and the support price is maintained at an attractive level, another above-average kharif outturn is likely.
India should remain the biggest rice exporter in 2017 and 2018
Based on their strong pace to date, which has been supported by large ship-ments to Africa and South Asia, India's exports in 2017 are expected to reach 11m tonnes, making the country the largest supplier to the world market for the sixth consecutive season. This represents an upgrade of 300,000 tonnes from our previous export forecast. Shipments in 2018 are anticipated to be slightly smaller year on year, at 10.7m tonnes. Within the total, basmati rice is mostly exported to Middle Eastern countries and Europe, while non-basmati rice is largely exported to Africa and some markets in Asia, principally South Asia. We assume that in 2019, competition from Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam, will result in a slight decline in sales, to 10.5m tonnes.
China's exports have expanded in 2017, mainly because of sales to Africa
Although China has emerged as the world's biggest importer of rice in recent years, it has, for the most part, been a tiny exporter. Over recent seasons its exports have fluctuated between 200,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes, with most heading to markets in Asia, including South Korea and Japan-these being part of minimum commitments to import by those nations under World Trade Organisation obligations.
However, in contrast with recent years, trade data show a significant expansion of exports in early 2017, mainly to destinations in Africa. Customs data show that January-June shipments amounted to almost 600,000 tonnes, roughly five times higher than in the same period last year. It is unclear whether such high sales can be sustained, especially since some of these shipments may have come in the form of aid. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that China is believed to sit on massive state reserves, despite a significant share of it being unfit for human consumption. China's exports have occasionally risen above 2m tonnes, notably in 2003, with much of the increase going to Africa and the Americas. In full-year 2017 volumes could be as large as 950,000 tonnes, but are likely to return to more normal levels in the following two years.
Production prospects for 2017/18 in Thailand are very positive
For many years Thailand was the biggest supplier of rice to world markets. However, a combination if its intervention buying programme and heavy competition from India resulted in it losing that position. More recently, exports have been boosted by availabilities from the government's stockpile, but prospects for production will ultimately shape the country's exportable surplus over the next two years. In the current season (2017/18) prospects for the main crop appear solid, with harvesting due to take place in late 2017. Cultivation is currently in the reproductive stage and progressing well. Cummulative precipitation during 2017 is estimated to be around one-quarter higher than average, while the impact of flooding in September is expected to be minimal. Good water levels will also be important during the development of the irrigated, off-season crop, which will be threshed next year.
Support from the Thai government will support output in 2017/18
Assuming the planted area is expanded in both seasons, total production is projected at 20.4m tonnes, up from 19m tonnes in the previous year and a five-year high. A further increase in main-crop sowings is projected to push output up to 22m tonnes in 2018/19.
In mid-September the Thai government approved a THB73bn (US$2.2bn) budget for 2017/18 on farm paddy pledging program to include main-crop rice varieties from November 1st 2017 through to the end of February 2018. The scheme is aimed at supporting domestic prices during the main crop harvest, with up to 2m tonnes of paddy set to be procured. The intervention price for white rice is 3% above that of the previous season. Additional measures have been announced, with farmers, millers and traders also receiving support in the form of subsidies and soft loans, as a means of encouraging participants to store rice through to 2018.
The government's stock dispoals have largely been successful
The Thai government has been saddled with excess reserves in recent years, an overhang of its earlier-and much-criticised-intervention buying programmes. However, considerable progress was made in disposing of this stockpile during the first half of 2017. Most government-held reserves have been of a questionable quality, with a large portion being sold to feed (as a substitute for corn and for imported feed wheat in swine feed rations) and industrial (ethanol) producers. However, a considerable volume of food-grade stocks have been made available to exporters at attractive prices, and these have been sold, or earmarked, for shipment to markets in Africa. This will help to sustain Thailand's exports at about 10.2m tonnes in 2018, with the potential to edge higher, to 10.5m tonnes, in the following year.
Vietnam faces competition from smaller and established exporters in Asia
Vietnam is a medium-sized rice producer but a major exporter. It typically accounts for 5-6% of global output but 15% of exports, making it the world's third-largest exporter, behind India and Thailand. The Vietnam Food Association oversees policy surrounding rice export registration requirements and the setting of the country's minimum export price for grades. Most exports are broken rice grades, including 5% and 25% varieties, with total sales usually shaped by deliveries to Asian markets, especially China, as well as to Africa. Exports are expected to pick up in 2017 and 2018, to reach 5.7m tonnes and 6.3m tonnes respectively. This will be because of firmer demand from leading importers. We expect Vietnam to maintain its position as the world's third biggest exporter in 2019 and beyond, although volumes are unlikely to exceed 7m tonnes in any season, given continued volumes from India and Thailand, as well as the growing competitive threat from other, relatively small exporters such as Cambodia and Myanmar.
A much smaller crop will constrain US rice exports in 2017/18
The US rice harvest is well advanced, estimated at close to 80% finished by late the beginning of October. Based on a heavy drop in plantings, production in 2017/18 is expected to fall to just 5.7m tonnes, down from 7.1m tonnes in the previous season. This would be the smallest outturn in two decades, and is expected to tighten availabilities for sale on the international market, notwith-standing a drop in domestic use. Nevertheless, the contraction will be limited by large opening stocks. Shipments in the local marketing year, starting on August 1st 2017, are forecast at 3.4m tonnes, down from 3.7m tonnes in the previous year. US rice is sold globally, but major markets, mainly for paddy (rough rice) exports, include Central and Latin America, owing to proximity.

Stocks and prices
Following a marginal drop in 2016/17, world rice stocks are forecast to fall more appreciably in 2017/18, by 8m tonnes, to a seven-year low of 96.9m tonnes. Although we expect China's supportive policies for farmers to ensure another rise in inventories, this will be in contrast to falls in the major global suppliers, as well as in other countries. In Thailand, for example, the government has had much success in disposing of its huge intervention stockpile. Inventories held by the world's leading exporters, which also include India, Pakistan, the US and Vietnam, are forecast at 22m tonnes, down by 5m tonnes year on year. This would be the smallest amount in a decade and highlights a global market that appears to be tighter than headline figures might suggest.
Stocks are expected to drop in the next two seasons on rising consumption
In 2018/19 although world output is still expected to climb from this season's record level, rising consumption will also cut into stocks, pushing them to another multi-year low of 87.7m tonnes. It is assumed that stockbuilding in China will continue, especially since imports are set to remain high, but exporters' reserves may fall once more.

Following significant, demand-driven increases in earlier months, markets in Asia have generally eased since mid-2017. The price of Thailand's 100% Grade B, a world benchmark, was quoted at US$389/tonne fob Bangkok in the first week of October, up marginally over the month, but still almost 20% below the high of mid-May. Downward pressure at Asian origins has come from slower open-market demand and seasonal pressure as some leading exporters harvested crops. In addition, while tighter supplies have supported values on some occassions, prospects for another good kharif outturn will have had a bearish influence on India's market.
However, in contrast, US milled rice export prices have remained high despite a slight fall month on month as the certainty of a heavy fall in production in 2017/18, and recent adverse weather, has boosted sentiment. The 4% broken variety was trading at US$515/tonne on October 5th, down by US$5/tonne from previous month, but well above the US$400/tonne level seen in April.
The pace of demand is likely to slow in the final months of 2017, at a time when the bulk of main crop harvests in major exporters come on stream. As a result, we have revised down our fourth-quarter price forecast slightly, to US$395/tonne (US$410/tonne previously). This results in an average price for that year of US$391/tonne, up by just 1.2% year on year.
Our supply and demand forecasts to the end of 2019 suggest there is potential for some upward pressure on prices as global supplies begin to tighten, owing to contraction in major exporters. By the fourth quarter of 2019 we forecast a price of US$425/tonne and, while this would equate to a five-year high, it would still be well below the levels witnessed in 2009-13. Accordingly, this would suggest that rice should remain attractively priced relative to the past. Of course, our forecasts for supply and demand, and hence prices, do imply that actual crop outcomes are as set out, and that there will be no significant changes in trade policy by importers or exporters during the next two years.

Soybeans
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global soybean consumption to expand by 4.3% in 2017/18-building on strong growth in the previous season, of an estimated 6.1%-in line with rising usage in animal feed and other sectors. At a total of 339m tonnes, global consumption in 2017/18 would be more than 100m higher than a decade earlier, largely owing to higher demand from China. However, some smaller consuming regions, including the EU, Africa and the Middle East, will also contribute to rising demand. Prospects for 2018/19 are unclear, since crop outcomes will not be known for another 12-18 months. However, we expect that rising usage in the animal feed sector could support similar demand growth that season, of 4.4%, to reach a record 354m tonnes.
World soybean trade in 2017/18 is forecast to rise for the seventh year in a row, to a record of 148.7m tonnes, with most of the expansion due to rising needs in China, as well as smaller markets in Asia. With demand from those same countries provisionally expected to increase, traded volumes could surpass 153m tonnes in 2018/19. These figures have been revised up (from 147m tonnes and 152m tonnes, respectively), owing to quicker than expected sales in 2016/17.
Feed usage will drive overall demand up and will mostly be met by imports
China is by far the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans, with growth largely driven by expanding demand from the country's vast animal feed sector. In 2017/18 we expect China's total consumption to reach a new record of 105m tonnes, representing impressive growth of about 6% and approaching a third of the amount used globally. Imports are forecast to total 95.5m tonnes, or more than 90% of consumption-which highlights the global market's dependence on Chinese processors. Although the government is looking to boost local output, it seems that imports will continue to account for a dominant, and possibly rising, share of overall requirements, especially in feed sectors. Most of what is produced locally is likely to be channelled to food and other smaller markets.
China's imports in 2018/19 are expected to close in on 100m tonnes
Despite reports of large stocks of soybeans and associated pressure on crush margins, import demand growth has remained robust throughout 2017, with buyers encouraged by a world market that is amply supplied and attractively priced. The country's value-added tax (VAT) rate was reduced by 2 percentage points from July 1st, which has helped to boost imports. The outlook for 2018/19 is tentative, but China's full-season purchases could approach 100m tonnes.
Nonetheless, the Chinese government's intention to end maize stockpiling, announced in 2016, remains a downside risk. The move aims to encourage the use of maize at the expense of other feed grains, which have been imported in great quantities in recent years. Higher maize consumption in the pork and poultry sectors could also raise questions surrounding the use of high-protein meals, primarily soybean meal. The impact, however, is likely to be marginal, as soybean meal is the most abundantly produced of all oilseed meals, with its attractiveness as a feed ingredient stemming from its high-protein quality and nutritional value compared with alternatives.
Ample domestic supplies will support demand in the US
With another bumper crop expected to result in a further swelling of domestic supplies, US consumption in 2017/18 is forecast to remain close to the previous season's high, at 56m tonnes. Aside from requirements locally, total use will be underpinned by rising exports of soybean meal. Similar trends will enable domestic demand potentially to edge up in 2018/19, to 57m tonnes.
Soybean consumption in Argentina will continue to be underpinned by growing international demand for soybean meal, of which Argentina is the dominant supplier to world markets. In Brazil, further increases in consumption are anticipated as bigger local soybean crops boost supplies for processing.

Supply
Since the planting season in South America is only now getting underway, there is considerable uncertainty about prospects for the 2017/18 world outturn. Never-theless, in the northern hemisphere, another season of big or record crops can be expected, judging by completed plantings and intentions, and early field reports. We expect these factors to support the second-largest harvest ever. With yields potentially falling short of what was achieved in 2016/17, production will be shaped by area gains. The following year (2018/19) will ultimately depend on outcomes in 2017/18, which are currently subject to speculation. Accordingly, our projection of a 0.7% year-on-year increase, to 344.7m tonnes, reflects our assumption of a slight rise in sowings and trend yields.
US production in 2017/18 is likely to set a new record, helped by better yields
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects seeded area in 2017/18 to increase by around 7% year on year, to 36.2m ha, the highest on record. In addition to a switch of acreage from maize and spring wheat, expanded area also stems from a steep contraction in winter wheat sowings.
Weather patterns during the current growing season have been a cause for concern in many parts of the Midwest, including dry and hot conditions in the east and in the northern Plains, with excessive rains a problem in eastern regions. Accordingly, it seems highly likely that average yields will not match those of the previous year. Nonetheless, local official projections and recent field reports reflect a more positive yield outlook; to reflet this, we have raised our 2017/18 production forecast to a record 120m tonnes, an increase of 2.6% year on year (from a marginal decrease previously). Together with high carryover stocks from the season before (ending August 31st), a crop of that size will ensure ample supplies for domestic use and export. We assume that recent delays to harvesting in parts of the Midwest will not have a detrimental impact.
US exports will reach a new record in 2017/18, but to stay below Brazil
US exports progressed strongly during the 2016/17 season, totalling 58.1m tonnes by end-August 2017 (the end of the marketing year), up significantly from 2015/16. The solid pace was shaped by international demand from Asia, but also a range of other, relatively small importers, including those in Africa and the Middle East. For 2017/18 we expect shipments to expand to 60m tonnes, a new high. Although the pace of sales has stepped up significantly in recent weeks, they remain well behind a year earlier; in the week to September 28th-which largely corresponds to the end of the first full month in the marketing year-all export commitments totalled 23.3m tonnes, down by almost 20% year on year. This proabaly reflects Brazil's strong export pace in 2017; some buyers appear hesitant to enter the world market, preferring to wait for the bulk of northern hemisphere supplies to come on stream at attractive prices.
Growers are likely to increase the planted area in 2018/19
Planting intentions for 2018/19 in the northern hemisphere are highly tentative at this stage and much will depend on relative prices at the time of planting, as well as crop rotation. While there is an argument in favour of increased corn plantings at the expense of soybeans following 2017/18 seeding patterns, support for soybean acreage could come from the continued expansion of global trade, driven by China's needs. We anticipate that the area planted to soybeans could contract by up to 3% in 2017/18. Combined with assumed trend yields, the 2018/19 outturn is projected at 114m tonnes-which is 5% lower than the previous season, but still the third-largest harvest of all time.
A huge crop will be cut in Canada, with further increases likely in the long term
The area for harvest in Canada is estimated at a record of 2.9m hectares, an unprecedented year-on-year expansion of 33%, driven by expanded acreage in the non-traditional growing areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, largely at the expense of wheat and canola. One of the key attractions is that Canadian growers are able to tap in to a fast-growing global market. Added to this, the crop requires less intensive application of inputs, such as fertilisers, compared with alternatives, and new varieties have been developed that can be cultivated in areas that were previously unsuitable. Despite the significant expansion of seeded area, some reduction in yields is expected, especially as earlier reports from Manitoba and Saskatchewan pointed to difficulties with crop development due to challenging weather. According to Canada's Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, output is expected to increase by 1.5m tonnes to 8m tonnes in 2017/18. Exports are projected to rise to 5.6m tonnes, up from 4.4m tonnes in the previous season.
Brazil's exports are likely to smash previous records in 2017/18
Brazil's huge 2016/17 crop boosted availabilities to record levels and, given expected growth in trade, positioned Brazil to export significantly larger volumes in the local marketing year (which closes at end-January 2018). We believe that total shipments could reach a record of at least 62m tonnes, up by 14% from 54.4m tonnes the previous year. With prospects for a marked rise in domestic prices in Brazil given current conditions, farmers may have significant stocks available for sale in the closing stages of the current year. Furthermore, with another big US crop anticipated and availabilities coming on stream in the final quarter of this year, there is potential for significant supplies in late 2017 and associated downward pressure on prices.
Growth in sowings in Brazil is expected in 2017/18, but may be limited by low prices
With plenty of land available, a further expansion of soybean area in Brazil is possible in 2017/18, and we are projecting 2% growth, to 34.5m hectares. Nevertheless, downside risks remain; current market conditions, including low domestic and soybean prices, coupled with exchange-rate uncertainty, will make it hard for many growers to cover production costs. Much will depend on the US harvest later this year and its global market impact.
It seems likely that, despite the aformentioned area increase, some growers will be tempted to scale back expenditure on essential inputs to minimise overall costs. Nevertheless, maize prices in Brazil are signficantly below year-ago levels-having fallen by a larger margin than soybean prices did-which makes it likely that some farmers will have switched a portion of their intended primary, or full-season, maize cropland to soybeans (most likely in areas where yields are lowest). Planting of the 2017/18 soybean crop began on September 11th in the state of Paraná-a few days earlier than normal-as part of a government experiment to see if early fieldwork is viable. Other states, including the major producing region of Mato Grosso, followed shortly after.
A potential La Niña event stands to bring drier than usual weather in late 2017
Planting was, however, stalled by difficult conditions with soils deemed to be too dry for seeding to advance in many areas. However, the first significant rains fell across central and southern Brazil in early October, improving the outlook somewhat. The rainfall was expected to continue throughout the first ten days of the month, before drier weather returns. Precipitation has been heavier in southern Brazil, including hail and high winds, with more expected in future. Moreover, the Brazilian National Meteorological Institute (Inmet) has released its forecast for the final quarter of 2017, which highlights the risk that a La Niña weather event will form. Many farmers in Brazil are already concerned about the potentially slow start to the season, so the potential of a mild La Niña-which typically brings below-normal rainfall for east-central and south-eastern Brazil-has added to their concerns.
With yields unlikely to be near those achieved in 2016/17, we forecast output to fall slightly in 2017/18, by 5% year on year, to 108m tonnes. Planting of the 2018/19 crop will not begin until mid-September 2018, so the outlook is highly provisional. Based on some further area expansion and trend productivity, output could be close to the 2016/17 high.
Soybean-Free Institute, a new body that is tasked with promoting the production of varieties of the oilseed that have not been genetically modified (GM), will promote non-GM soybeans around the world. Its membership includes producers, fertiliser suppliers, exporters and a range of other bodies. Non-GM varieties typically command a premium in the global market, and the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics estimates that 10%-15% of acreage in the state in 2016/17 was seeded to those types.
Access to Northern Arc ports will be key to lifting export volumes in long term
We expect Brazil's exports to rise to an average of 65m tonnes per year in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 marketing seasons (February-January). In the longer term, however, soybean export growth will depend on the ability to move supplies more effectively to Brazil's Northern Arc ports-a collection of facilities designed to boost exports. As was the case last season, data from the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics underscored slow farmer sales amid low domestic and world prices: by mid-September just 15% of anticipated 2017/18 crops had been sold, down from 26% one year ago.
Production in Argentina could fall in 2017/18 on potential area declines
In Argentina, production in 2017/18 is forecast to fall by 4.4% year on year, to 54m tonnes, as many farmers are still likely to favour other crops, such as corn, following the late-2015 elimination of export taxes. While the government is set gradually to reduce soybean export levies over the course of 2018 and 2019, the crop will still not be as an attractive as others. Fieldwork for the 2017/18 crop is expected to begin in central areas in late October and early November. As such, there have been hightened concerns about the impact of earlier heavy rains and flooding, with some fields too wet ahead of the planting campaign. A period of dry weather is needed to ensure that soils are in good shape. However, as with Brazil, seeding decisions will depend on market conditions at the time of planting. In both years Argentina will remain by far the dominant supplier of soybean products to world markets.
China's output is rising, but still only meets a fraction of domestic demand
Despite being by far the world's largest importer, China is also a minor producer of soybeans. However, its potential has been capped by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players, as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, corn and rice. Nonetheless, in August 2016 the Chinese authorities published a National Oilseed Development Plan, which aims to boost domestic production to 60m tonnes by 2020. The scheme will provide support for oilseed production, processing, technical extension and innovation. In 2016/17 total acreage is up by an estimated 10% from the previous season, and a further increase is likely in 2017/18, with a small portion of land coming from the switching out of corn production in north-eastern areas. Total output in that season is expected to rise to a peak of 14.3m tonnes, up from 13.1m tonnes in the previous year, while the same influences will underpin another increase in output to 15.2m tonnes in 2018/19.

India's production remains reliant on seasonal variations in rainfall
The monsoon season is now complete in India-where the soybean crop is entirely a summer-sown crop-with cumulative precipitation in the June-September period down by 5% from the long-term average. Seeding fell by 900,000 hectares compared with the previous season, to 10.5m hectares. As a result, we now expect production to fall to 11m tonnes in 2017/18, a decrease of 8.3% year on year (4.2% previously). As it does every season, the production outlook in 2018/19 will hinge on the monsoon, which will arrive on the south-west coast in early June 2018. Output is pegged at 12m tonnes in that year.
Stocks and prices
Following a record-breaking year in 2016/17-both in terms of production and growth in global stocks-the situation in future years is likely to be somewhat tighter. While a further increase in inventories is expected in 2017/18, this is likely to be extremely modest, given that world output will fall as consumption expands. At 121.7m tonnes, global reserves are forecast to be around 3m tonnes larger than in the prior season, although this would be around 35m tonnes higher than the previous five-year average.
Looking below the top-line numbers, US ending stocks (at the close of its marketing year, on August 30th 2018) are projected to be slightly bigger year on year, although this contrasts with potential falls in Argentina and Brazil. China may also see some destocking following recent years of heavy imports.

While this suggests little scope for a price recovery in that year, the supply and demand outlook does assume that conditions for crop development are favourable in most countries. Should crops falter in any of the main producing countries, then the balance sheet could be significantly tighter and may fuel a run-up in prices. Nevertheless, based on our current projections, we see a drop in inventories of a little over 9m tonnes in 2018/19. This is significant since it would be the first annual contraction in carryovers in seven seasons.
Export quotations in the US were modestly lower in the month leading up to October 5th. US futures showed strength at times, linked to firmer international demand, as well as to concerns about southern hemisphere weather as the 2017/18 planting campaigns got underway; however, weakening basis levels at US Gulf export terminals, as harvesting in the Midwest advanced, weighed on prices overall. More recently, reports of delays to fieldwork have supported prices, limiting overall monthly declines. At an average of US$376/tonne fob Gulf in early October, export prices were down by US$7/tonne over the month. Given the concerns about the impact of adverse seeding conditions on Argentina and Brazil, quotations there held steady at US$380/tonne and US$383/tonne, respectively.
We expect prices to contract slightly in the final quarter of 2017, pushing the full-year average price down by 3.3% compared with 2016, to US$377/tonne fob. On the basis of our forecast for a modest rise in global stocks, the potential for price gains in 2018 is very limited. We expect prices to rise by just 1.2% that year, before climbing more quickly, by 3%, in 2018 as global stocks dip slightly.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand by an average of 1.2% in 2017/18-2018/19 (October-September), roughly in line with the average over the past four seasons. Rising demand will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are gradually adopting the food-and-drink habits of developed-world countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift, as a sweetener in food and beverages, and as a binding and preserving agent in processed foods, including use by fast-food outlets. However, a modest slowdown in economic growth in emerging markets (particularly in Asia) will dampen the pace of consumption growth in the coming years. Moreover, heightened awareness about the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put pressure on consumption growth in developed markets, where the average consumption often already exceeds recommended levels. Amid consumer pressure on the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in some markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products, a gradual shift towards synthetic sweeteners will somewhat lessen demand for sugar. Moreover, owing to the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (whose market will be liberalised in September 2017), these cheaper alternatives will further limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of relatively low global sugar prices on consumption will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies in many developed countries and new protectionist moves in several emerging markets, both of which will limit the extent to which lower prices are passed through to consumers.
Slower GDP growth in China will weigh on sugar demand
Sugar consumption in China is low, at around 11 kg per head compared with an average of 24 kg in developed countries, leaving considerable room for growth. Changing consumer tastes and rising urbanisation will continue to spur demand. However, we expect the pace of consumption growth to moderate as slower economic growth dampens investment and weighs on income growth. This will be compounded by the growing supply of starch-based sweetener, which is a cheaper rival to sugar in the beverages industry, and higher domestic sugar prices, which are a likely consequence of the government's recent move to restrict imports. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government has reduced permits (to 1m tonnes, roughly half the previous level) and raised duties (from 50% to 95%) on out-of-quota sugar imports. These measures have led to a sharp drop in import demand, which shrank by 45% in August compared with year-earlier levels. However, we doubt that China will be able to scale up domestic production in 2017/18-2018/19 to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high level of stocks. It is therefore expected to remain a fairly significant player in the global market.
Consumption in India is forecast to recover as prices normalise
After consumption in India slumped in 2016/17, amid high post-drought prices and unsupportive policy moves (including demonetisation and the removal of some consumer subsidies), we expect demand to recover in the coming years as domestic supply improves. The government has come under pressure from industry stakeholders to protect the local industry from a flood of imports, as low global sugar prices and a strong rupee leave domestic producers struggling to compete. In response, it raised import duties from 40% to 50% in mid-2017. However, the near-term impact of this will be muted by the strong local harvest and, with large supplies from 2017/18 hitting the market imminently, we expect domestic prices to fall. This, together with rising incomes, will support demand.
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is positive. Some of the more developed countries, such as Malaysia and South Korea, are likely to grow only slowly as markets mature, but this will be more than offset by populous developing countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. However, demand growth in this region will be somewhat dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry to cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer) increases production and seeks export markets. Tax measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines could also dampen demand, with Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia pursuing plans to introduce a so-called sugar tax. This has the potential to put a sharp brake on demand; for example, the introduction of a sugar tax in Mexico in 2015 has contributed to a 12% drop in sugar demand since then. Nevertheless, we assume that any such policies in Asia will be rolled out only slowly over the coming years, amid concerns over restricting growth in the otherwise burgeoning food and drink manufacturing industries.
Health warnings may eventually dent sugar demand in the developed world
Demand growth in the mature EU market is likely to be sluggish in 2017/18-2018/19. Many EU countries already average far higher consumption levels of sugar than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), much of which is hidden in processed foods, and the EU Consumer Organisation is urging the food industry to take notice of WHO guidelines. So far, tax measures have been proposed to curb use in countries including the UK, Spain and Belgium. The policy response is likely to be watered down somewhat by opposition from the powerful food and drink industry, but consumer pressure will lead to a gradual shift in the food industry toward lower sugar levels. In addition, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based sweetener) will be liberalised in September 2017 and, as in the US, this is likely to steal market share gradually from sugar over the medium term.
EU net sugar import demand in recent years averaged over 2m tonnes/year (t/y), but a liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farmgate prices and export caps were abolished-will limit the need for imports. As well as the adjustment to the new liberalised regime, the UK's exit from the EU is generating uncertainty in the European sugar industry. The UK is the largest importer of EU sugar and the second-largest contributor to the bloc's agricultural programme, but there is little clarity over how this relationship will play out in the long term.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase, with the bulk of growth coming from expanding indigenous supplies that make sugar more affordable. Several consumers (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. But inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. Health warnings could temper the pace of consumption growth. However, as in EU countries, this is meeting resistance from its food and beverage industries; in South Africa, for example, plans to introduce a sugar tax have reportedly been pushed back to 2018 amid pressure from businesses. Overall, changing consumer tastes and population growth will drive average demand growth of 2.1% per year in 2017/18-2018/19.
Policy changes will shift the dynamics of the global sugar trade
The overhaul of EU sugar policy in 2017 is likely to have a significant effect on global trade patterns as the bloc transitions from being a net importer to becoming a net exporter. Barring any unexpected weather-related shocks to the EU harvest, we expect this transition to be complete by the end of the 2017/18 season. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hardest hit by this shift. Global trade dynamics will also be affected by the introduction of heavy import tariffs in China, with small producers (exempt from the new tariffs) likely to increase their market share. A trade deal between the US and Mexico came into effect in July, tightening up the rules for Mexican producers and granting Mexico the right of first refusal for the US's above-quota import demand. Moreover, a planned trade deal between Australia and Indonesia may help Australian producers to capture a greater share of this growing market.
Although these policy measures and trade deals will shift the direction of global trade flows, trade volumes will ultimately be defined by countries' preference for holding strategic stockpiles of sugar to hedge against future shocks. We expect trade to increase in 2017/18 as countries (notably China) seek to rebuild stocks after several years of low domestic production and relatively high global prices, before trade flows slow in 2018/19 on the back of bumper local harvests in markets that traditionally swing between net imports and net exports (notably India).

Supply
After fairly modest growth of 2.1% in 2016/17, and shrinking global supply in the two previous years, world sugar production is forecast to increase by 6.8% in 2017/18, to 179.2m tonnes. This is a slight upward revision from our previous forecast (177.7m tonnes), as the impact of lower than expected output from Latin America (following the destructive impact of Hurricane Irma on sugar production in Cuba) is more than offset by brisk supply growth in Russia and India. Russia is on course for a record beet harvest, while in India the area under cane cultivation is wider than previously expected (up by more than 10% year on year). This puts India on course for its highest output since 2014/15, despite a slightly sub-average monsoon season. Elsewhere, global supply will also be supported by strong crop revivals in Thailand, following weather-related shocks during the previous harvest, and strong output growth in the EU as producers seek to capitalise on the newly liberalised sugar regime. The world's largest producer, Brazil, will benefit from a second consecutive year of crop-friendly growing conditions and, with a significant amount of output locked into generously priced forward contracts, the supply of cane to sugar production is likely to remain above historical levels.
In 2018/19 we forecast global production to remain well above average annual production of 169m tonnes over the past five years, albeit declining by 0.5% year-on-year, to 178.3m tonnes. This is down slightly on our previous forecast, owing to more muted expectations on output in Brazil. As price parity between sugar and ethanol in Brazil prompts crushers to balance their cane supply between the two, we expect production from that country to drop in 2018/19. This will be only partially offset by higher production in the EU and China as the governments of these countries promise cane growers higher prices, and in Europe, where efforts among producers to capture global market share will sustain higher output levels. However, our forecast is contingent on normal weather conditions, and even fairly modest disruptions to rainfall patterns pose significant risk on both the upside and downside of our projections.
Output growth in Brazil is in prospect as cane supply increases
Brazil is on course for a bumper cane harvest, with both yields and volumes surpassing market expectations in the early months of the local 2017/18 season (April-March). This stems largely from favourable weather conditions, since sugar cane fields are ageing and field renewal rates are low. With cane supply robust, the main factor shaping Brazil's sugar output will be the supply of cane for sugar vis-à-vis ethanol production. The government reduced a federal ethanol tax in late July, which has the potential to boost ethanol demand and therefore to prompt crushers to divert cane to the fuel industry. With sugar and ethanol prices now hovering around parity, there is already some evidence that mills are shifting to ethanol production. Indeed, only 50% of cane was used for sugar production in August; this is the lowest share in several months, although it is still above the historical average of 44%. A significant volume of cane was locked into sugar contracts at a time of higher global prices, and the overall production mix for the 2017/18 local season will probably favour sugar. In 2018/19 the weakness of the Real will support the attractiveness of the export-oriented sugar industry, while only marginal growth in global oil prices will sap demand for biofuels. Overall, we expect ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil to hover around parity. This will spur further diversion of cane supply back to ethanol, at the expense of sugar production. Moreover, low field renewal rates will probably begin to take a toll on cane output from 2018/19, thereby reducing the overall cane crush. Sugar production is therefore forecast to moderate to 38.6m tonnes in 2018/19, from 39.6m tonnes in 2017/18.
EU production will recover as the sugar regime is liberalised
In Europe, sugar output is poised for brisk growth as producers seek to take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system. Under the new regime, which came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 season, many producers in the less-efficient producing regions will close down owing to reduced support. Yet those in the more efficient areas (led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries) will easily extend their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity without significant additional investments. We expect EU production to reach 18m tonnes in 2017/18, up from 15.9m tonnes in 2016/17, and this will probably surpass EU demand. The pace of export growth will be limited in 2017/18 by moves to bolster local stocks. This will, however, serve to protect local producers from the current global price slump and should therefore sustain relatively high levels of output in 2018/19.
Favourable weather conditions are expected to lead to a record beet crop in Russia's 2017/18 local season (August-February), building on strong growth in 2016/17. Owing to significant investment in the modernisation of sugar factories in recent years, sugar production is likely to remain robust throughout the forecast period. The ensuing surplus will support Russia's emergence as a notable exporter as the government seeks to prevent stock build-ups from depressing domestic prices and deterring planting. However, we think that the authorities' forecast that exports will reach almost 1m t/y is overoptimistic, owing to soft demand for imports in Central Asia (Russia's main market) and the country's limited output of high-value sugar (which is in higher demand globally).
Output in Thailand is recovering from El Niño's long reach
In Thailand, favourable rainfall patterns will support a bumper harvest in 2017/18 of 11.9m tonnes. Assuming that rainfall normalises in 2018/19, we forecast a more moderate, albeit still decent, output of 10.2m tonnes. The sugar industry's exposure to weather-related shocks is, however, gradually increasing as production moves towards the more drought-prone interior regions. This shift is a result of ongoing efforts to scale up production. Following a challenge by Brazil, which argued that Thailand was violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free competition, the Thai government has agreed to remove production subsidies in December 2017. This will inflate costs, but we do not expect it to erode the country's competitiveness entirely. Increasing mechanis-ation will help to boost yields, and the sugar cane area in Thailand will continue to expand as farmers turn away from less profitable rice crops. Producers will also be incentivised by export opportunities to other Asian markets, where demand is rising and Thai sugar enjoys favourable access under the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade arrangement.
A major recovery in China's sugar sector appears unlikely for now
China's sugar output has fallen sharply in recent years, owing partially to the effects of state subsidies, at a time of rapidly rising costs for labour, land and farm machinery. Amid political pressure from the local industry, some support has been forthcoming in the form of input subsidies and soft loans, and the government has raised duties on out-of-quota sugar imports in a bid to protect local producers from cheaper imports. These measures will support the profitability of the local industry and should spur some investment, but we doubt that they will lead to a significant surge in domestic supply growth. The sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high and sugar cane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. Indeed, the cost of producing sugar cane in China is almost double that in Thailand, and this will deter investment. The government is attempting to encourage consolidation among the many disparate industry players in the country's main sugar region of Guangxi in an attempt to improve its competitiveness. However, similar moves in the past, for example in the soy market, have not yielded impressive results, and high local prices will probably allow some small, inefficient players to remain in the market. We do not, therefore, expect output to rise by the 10% per year that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals. However, given more favourable growing conditions (compared at least with the El Niño-linked dry conditions of 2015/16-2016/17), we expect output to rise to an average of 10.3m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19.

Stocks and prices
After successive supply deficits and a period of relatively high global prices, global sugar stocks shrank to 87.4m tonnes at end-2016/17. We expect the stocks to recover to 95.5m tonnes at end-2018/19 as the market swings back into surplus. The market surplus is forecast to reach 5.7m tonnes in 2017/18, amid bumper harvests from key producers and lacklustre demand growth, before moderating to 2.4m tonnes in 2018/19 as output levels decline. Although overall stocks will remain comfortable (equivalent to 54% of annual consumption), the uneven distribution of these stocks means that reserves will not always be available to the market, and occasional supply squeezes are possible.

The latest sugar price rally has peaked
After peaking at over 23 US cents/lb in late 2016, global sugar prices fell by 30% over the first half of 2017, before stabilising in the third quarter, at about 14.5 US cents/lb. In part, this reflects a market correction after overshooting in late 2016, with speculative investors unwinding the long positions that they had adopted during the price boom. More fundamentally, crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets are fuelling expectations of a global sugar surplus in the coming years, and policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably, China, India and Europe) have further weakened market sentiment. Amid oversupply and only modest consumption growth, we expect prices to remain under pressure in the final months of 2017, averaging an estimated 16.1 US cent/lb over the full year, down by 11% on the previous year.
The price outlook beyond 2017 will depend largely on supply dynamics. In the crucial Brazilian market, higher diversion of cane to ethanol production over the coming years will dampen production and provide some support for prices, but a swing to ethanol that is substantial enough to bring the global sugar market into balance seems unlikely. Meanwhile, barring any weather-related shocks, the prospects of global oversupply will continue to weigh heavily on prices. On the back of upward revisions to our forecast of the global surplus in 2017/18-2018/19, we have shaved our price projections slightly and now expect prices to be range-bound between 15.5 US cents/lb and 16.5 US cents/lb. More aggressive policy moves to curb sugar consumption could weigh further on sentiment (and therefore prices). Nonetheless, with the sugar trade aware that the global market needs to offer a workable price for producers, we doubt that prices will remain lower than this range for prolonged periods. Weather-related shocks in producer markets continue to pose the most significant upside risk to prices.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Sunflowerseed oil consumption continues to exceed expectations. The Economist Intelligence Unit has again revised up its estimate for sunflowerseed oil consumption growth in 2016/17, as global consumption is likely to have breached 18m tonnes, up by an estimated 14.6% year on year. Increasing availability of sunflowerseed oil should help it to maintain competitiveness in 2017/18, when we expect demand to rise by a further 3.5%, to 18.7m tonnes. Consumption is likely to exceed 19m tonnes in 2018/19, although this relies on sunflowerseed oil maintaining its competitive position against other oils.
Sunflowerseed oil's improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
EU consumption of sunflowerseed oil in 2016/17 has exceeded previous expectations. We now estimate consumption of 4.4m tonnes (previously 4.3m tonnes), a year-on-year increase of over 12% Sunflowerseed oil is a preferred oil among consumers, owing in part to its persistent discount to both rapeseed and soybean oils. Overall consumption in 2016/17 includes a substantial volume of imported sunflowerseed oil. With better global availability, we expect EU sunflowerseed oil consumption to continue to expand in 2017/18-2018/19, albeit at a more modest rate of 2.1% per year.
Russian consumption will rise modestly as the economy emerges from recession
In Russia, higher local availability of sunflowerseed oil will help to keep a lid on domestic prices, which will support consumption growth. We maintain our estimate for Russian sunflowerseed oil consumption of 2.5m tonnes in 2016/17, reflecting robust growth of 8.3%. Sunflowerseed oil availability looks set to remain comfortable in 2017/18, and this will support continued demand growth. Our current forecast is for consumption of just under 2.6m tonnes, up by 3% year on year. However, the consumption forecast remains contingent on the continued economic recovery, and any setback in overall growth is likely to weigh on consumption. In 2018/19 we expect demand growth to be sustained, at 2.9%, assuming good local availability.
Robust GDP growth and shifting preferences will boost India's usage
India has been an active buyer of Black Sea sunflowerseed oil in the 2016/17 season. High import levels and increased local sunflowerseed crushing have both contributed to consumption growth. Imports were notably high in July and are reported to have been strong in August. We estimate that India's sunflowerseed oil consumption reached nearly 2.2m tonnes in 2016/17, up by 32.3% year on year. It will be difficult to stimulate much growth, following the surge in 2016/17; nonetheless, the rising consumer preference for sunflowerseed oil, especially in the south of India, is likely to see consumption expand again in 2017/18, by 5.1%. The recent increase in import duties on vegetable oils (including sunflowerseed oil) and lower domestic sunflowerseed production will constrain demand growth over the forecast period. We expect consumption growth to continue in 2018/19, but, again, at a lower rate, of 2.6%.
Turkish consumption will increase in 2017/18-2018/19
Many countries have been increasing their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. Supplies are likely to remain comfortable throughout the forecast period, which will continue this trend. Countries increasing their use of sunflowerseed oil include Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, as well as several smaller countries. Growth in consumption in these "other" countries will moderate in 2017/18, following a robust performance in 2016/17.

Supply
We now estimate that global sunflowerseed oil production in 2016/17 reached 18.3m tonnes, up by more than 15% year on year. Another bumper sunflowerseed crop is expected in 2017/18; indeed, recent upward revisions to crop estimates mean that it will fall just short of the 2016/17 total. We expect sunflowerseed oil output to rise by 1% in 2017/18, to a record 18.5m tonnes, reflecting improved seed availability. Sunflowerseed remains a profitable crop in its major growing areas, and a further expansion of area is likely in 2018/19. Our tentative projections suggest sufficient seed availability to rebuild stocks and allow for sunflowerseed oil output of 18.9m tonnes, up by 2% year on year.
Ukraine's 2016/17 sunflowerseed harvest exceeds our expectations
Steady export demand for sunflowerseed oil continues to maintain strong rates of crushing in Ukraine. As a result, we have revised up our estimate for Ukraine's sunflowerseed oil production in 2016/17, to 6.3m tonnes, a 24.5% increase year on year (23% previously). Harvesting of the 2017/18 sunflowerseed crop is progressing well, with about 70% of the area harvested by the first week of October. Yields have failed to live up to early expectations; our harvest estimate has been reduced, to 13.7m tonnes, and some local estimates put the total even lower. With relatively plentiful sunflowerseed stocks carried over, this is not likely to have an immediate impact on crush rates; however, for the season as a whole, crushing will be reduced. We forecast sunflowerseed oil production to fall to 6.1m tonnes in 2017/18, down by 3%. This forecast may be reduced further if the harvest is further downgraded or sporadic reports of low oil content are confirmed. Although the 2018/19 outlook is still provisional, the industry's strong expansion in recent years should ensure ample seed availability despite concerns over crop rotations. We expect output in 2018/19 to rise to nearly 6.3m tonnes, on a par with the record outturn in 2016/17.
Sunflowerseed will remain a popular crop in Russia
In Russia, sunflowerseed crushing has also been running at high levels, and we expect oil production to have reached 4.6m tonnes in 2016/17, up by 17%. Unlike Ukraine, yield estimates based on the area harvested so far are optimistic. Along with a record area, these better yields suggest a crop of almost 11.8m tonnes in 2017/18, which would be another record. With more than sufficient crush capacity in Russia, output tends to be limited by market availability for the oil. We forecast a modest rise in sunflowerseed oil output, to nearly 4.7m tonnes.
Estimates for the EU 2016/17 sunflowerseed harvest have improved
EU crushing demand for sunflowerseed has remained strong, reflecting the shortfall in rapeseed supplies. Over the 2016/17 season as a whole, we continue to expect that production of sunflowerseed oil will reach 3.2m tonnes, almost exceeding the previous record of 2014/15. Harvesting is making steady progress and yields appear to be better than first thought. Notably, the outturn in Romania and Hungary will be higher than previously expected, offsetting lower output from Bulgaria. We have increased our harvest estimate to 8.5m tonnes in 2017/18, above last year but still short of the 2013/14 and 2014/15 harvests, both of which exceeded 9m tonnes. We have maintained our assessment that sunflowerseed oil output will be similar to that of 2016/17, at 3.2m tonnes.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain good, but downside risks are mounting
In Argentina, we maintain our estimate that 2016/17 sunflowerseed oil production will come in at 1.3m tonnes. We expect that the sunflowerseed area will expand for the 2017/18 season. Sowings got off to a good start, although wet conditions have hampered later plantings. Sunflowerseed production could be almost 4m tonnes, the highest total for a decade. We expect that sunflowerseed oil production will exceed 1.4m tonnes in both 2017/18 and 2018/19, leaving room for additional sunflowerseed exports.

At the end of the 2016/17 season we expect sunflowerseed oil stocks to remain high, both in absolute terms and relative to consumption. Indeed, relative to consumption, oil stocks have been at similar levels for each of the last three seasons. However, this is only achieved at the expense of sunflowerseed stocks, which, at the end of 2016/17, will be below average. We expect the market to register a small deficit in 2017/18, bringing sunflowerseed oil stocks back to normal levels. However, the tight sunflowerseed stocks are likely to persist during 2017/18, despite the expected good harvest. Indeed, the tightening of sunflowerseed stocks may be sufficient to cause a reduction in sunflowerseed crushing from the levels currently forecast. As production growth moderates, we expect stock levels to fall further in 2018/19, to below normal levels.

Upward pressure on prices will be felt in the coming months
Sunflowerseed oil prices increased again in September, although the increase was relatively small. With a market deficit likely in 2017/18 and tightening sunflowerseed stocks, prices should start to edge up over the coming months. We expect this upward trend to continue into the 2018/19 season. The strength of rapeseed prices should also be positive for sunflowerseed oil values. Price rises are likely to be comparatively small but persistent, bringing average prices up to the US$900/tonne level by the end of the 2018/19 season.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for one-third of world tea consumption and is consuming ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is also growing in other major consuming regions, including India and the US. Demand for tea is less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities, reflecting its low cost, meaning that tea demand will be driven primarily by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast rates for tea consumption growth, of 3.8% a year on average in 2018-19, are relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and "ready to drink" tea beverages account for a small share of the tea market but have enjoyed rapid growth in sales-even in traditional markets such as China-which will also contribute to demand growth.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption. In producing countries, tea will benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places will remain a consumer staple, despite a steady increase in consumption of other beverages, including coffee. Combined with favourable demographics, consumption growth in producing countries should rise further. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partially to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2017-18
Tea consumption is dominated by Asia, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2017, up from 48% in 2010. In China, we expect the government's efforts to rein in credit growth to contribute to an economic slowdown from 2018, which will moderate tea consumption growth. Nonetheless, demand will remain strong compared with many other markets, expanding by 4% a year in 2018-19. This forecast is relatively cautious, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) projecting average annual Chinese demand growth of 15% until 2024, suggesting an upside risk to our forecasts. Average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China just 14th in the world. This leaves significant room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drink tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting com-petition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 40% per year since 2002, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Other changes in consumer habits will also affect tea sales, with greater demand for teabags globally (these are less wasteful than loose-leaf tea). However, given the importance attached to the quality of tea, sales of leaf teas will continue to dominate the local market.
In India, strong economic growth will be accompanied by higher household spending and firm consumer confidence, which will support annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2018-19, marginally lower than estimated growth of 6.5% in 2017. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is even lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently, the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. The expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share, as well as fuelling overall tea consumption growth.

Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2018-19 by market saturation and weakening demographics. Indeed, the FAO forecasts an overall contraction until 2024 in many EU markets (which together account for just under 5% of global consumption), despite a firmer economic performance, as well as in Russia (2.5% of global consumption). Turkey, which also accounts for around 5% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting continued population growth and steady growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. We forecast average annual growth in tea demand in 2018-19 of 1.9% in the EU and 0.4% in Turkey. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 2.5% per year, but is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consump-tion in 2013-16.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for less than 2.5% of global consumption, and consumption per head is low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea. We expect demand to increase by an annual average of 2.6% in 2018-19, partly reflecting our fairly upbeat forecast for economic growth. Health concerns will also sustain demand for tea, with a gradual shift away from carbonated beverages and towards those perceived as healthier, including tea.
New tea markets are emerging
Export data from tea-producing countries reveal that new markets for tea are emerging, with the number of countries buying tea at the major auction houses in Asia and Africa on the rise. Demand from these new joiners in the tea market, mainly faster-growing emerging countries, is set to increase in 2018-19, underpinning our forecast for average consumption growth of 2.5% a year across all "other countries", which together account for 18% of global consumption.
Supply
After an estimated 1.2% contraction in global tea production in 2017-the first fall in output since our data series (which is based on historical data from the FAO) began in 2000-tea production is forecast to recover in 2018-19, rising by 3% and 2% respectively. However, these growth rates remain weak by historical comparison; annual growth in tea output averaged 4.4% in 2004-14. Other than weather concerns, several structural factors will prevent faster production growth. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades because of the higher cost of inputs, and this has resulted in a fall in investment. Notwithstanding a recent softening of the US dollar, many currencies will remain comparatively weak against the dollar in 2018-19, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers.
Much of the increase in global tea production in 2018-19 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects the rise in tea production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, compared with 43% a decade ago.
As in 2016, adverse weather will harm Chinese tea production in 2017
China experienced the second consecutive year of disappointing tea production growth in 2017. We estimate that output expanded by 2.2%, after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, in June. The government stated that over 750,000 ha of crops were damaged, and although it made no direct reference to tea, we believe that production was affected. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which will also have hampered production.
Even on the assumption that weather conditions will improve in 2018-19, production growth is forecast to slow further, to an annual average of 2%. Underlying economic growth will slow during 2018 as the government takes action to bring debt levels under control, and is not projected to accelerate significantly in 2019. We expect government efforts to modernise the agri-cultural sector-through large-scale lending from the state-owned Agricultural Development Bank of China-to progress only slowly, with some Chinese tea investors instead seeking to expand production overseas rather than in China (talks are under way to discuss the possibility of a 6,000-ha tea plantation in the Philippines). These factors will combine to undermine growth in tea output.
Beyond the forecast period there is scope for a return to firmer rates of tea production growth. The authorities are engaged in efforts to lift product quality and quantity in order to boost exports (only around 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Given that China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 785 kg in 2012-14, compared with 2,085 kg in India and 2,105 kg in Kenya), there is certainly potential for gains in productivity.
India's tea production will continue to grow in 2018 and 2019
We estimate tea production growth of 3.3% in India in 2017. Output fell in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state), as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India, but weather conditions improved subsequently. Assuming supportive weather conditions in 2018-19, we expect tea production to continue to rise, albeit more gradually. Continued efforts to channel funding to tea growers will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back production. There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly and rising input costs have eroded profits, implying that in the long term India may struggle to increase growth as significantly as other major producers. We forecast average growth in tea production of 2% per year in 2018-19.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
We estimate a double-digit decline in tea output in Sri Lanka in 2017, reflecting recent torrential rain that caused landslides and the worst flooding in over a decade. The authorities have said that this will affect tea output, as the worst-affected areas were tea-growing regions in the south of the country. Many of the 400,000 farmers, who account for 70% of national tea output, saw their bushes submerged by muddy water. Sri Lanka's tea production is forecast to rise in 2018, by 5.8%, but this will largely reflect a cyclical recovery after several disappointing years. As in India, there are several structural hurdles that will hamper growth, even assuming that weather conditions improve. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not yet sufficiently high to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. In addition, there are local reports that fertiliser application has been low, and there is a continued risk of industrial unrest. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. These factors explain why our projection for tea production growth in 2019 (1.8%) is relatively weak.
Moreover, the main customers for Sri Lankan tea-Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria-have all experienced economic turbulence in recent years. Economic conditions are expected to improve markedly in Iran with the lifting of sanctions, and to a lesser degree in Russia and Turkey, but this is unlikely to be enough to boost demand for Sri Lankan tea significantly. Most of the country's tea is loose leaf, rather than mass-produced tea bags, which limits the extent to which the country can diversify its tea export market base towards Europe and the US. The Ministry of Plantation Industries has stated that it is considering a proposal to allow tea imports for blending in an attempt to boost export potential, and the Tea Board is continuing to urge the government to take measures to make the tea industry more competitive, but it is unclear if there is sufficient support domestically to push the measure through, as there is a strong perception among farmers that this would undermine local production.
A partial recovery in output is likely in Kenya in 2018-19
After a massive jump in tea production in Kenya in 2016, with output hitting an all-time high of 473,000 tonnes, weather conditions deteriorated sharply in 2017, with a renewed and persistent dry spell damaging tea plantations. Kenya's agriculture minister has stated that tea output is likely to fall by 12%, but our estimate envisages a much sharper drop, of 24%. Although tea production is forecast to stage a partial recovery in 2018-19, rising by 15.3% and 3.6% respectively, output levels even in 2019 will remain relatively weak. A change in the tea levy on farmers, so that it is based on the value rather than the volume of sales, will undermine profitability in the medium term. Furthermore, although the government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, conflicting interests and a lack of funds will hinder progress.

Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes three to five years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact on output of recent price falls will be evident only after the forecast period.
Stocks and prices
We estimate a fourth consecutive year of market deficits in 2017, reflecting increasing consumption and a contraction in output from several of the main tea-producing countries. We expect consumption growth to outstrip production growth during 2018-19, meaning that we forecast deepening market deficits in those years.
Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge how significantly these widening market deficits will affect stock levels. The fact that prices fell during 2015-16 despite market deficits in both years indicates that stock movements have only a limited impact on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output in China, which mainly consists of green tea. While some of the production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.

Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya respectively (essentially, black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. As an example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have risen sharply in 2017, while prices at the Kolkata auction have remained similar to their year-earlier levels for much of the year. Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes (there is no futures market). Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat slightly in 2018-19
We estimate a full-year average price of US$3.05/kg in 2017, a 15.7% year-on-year increase, reflecting the weak outlook for production and continued firm consumption growth. Although the market deficit will remain large in 2018-19, recovering production is expected to reduce prices by 5.7%, to an average of US$2.88/kg in 2018, and by a further 2.2% in 2019, to US$2.81/kg.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has increased strongly in the past 50 years, rising from less than 250m tonnes/year (t/y) in the early 1960s to more than 700m t/y in recent years. Helped by solid gains in developing countries, growth was particularly rapid in the three decades to 1990, rising by an average of 3% a year, before slowing slightly since then. Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been tied to a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has persistently outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and for the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global consumption to rise marginally, by 0.4%, to nearly 738m tonnes in 2017/18-up slightly from our previous forecast of 0.1% growth, owing to higher demand projections for the EU and Russia. Although wheat use for food is expected to increase once again, in line with the recent trend, it appears likely that world feed consumption will decline, owing partly to competition from alternative products. A similar pattern is expected in 2018/19. Although use for feed is expected to slip back further, a rise for milling and food use should see total demand increase by 0.6%, to 742m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in world food-wheat consumption has remained relatively consistent over the past decade or so, with increases averaging 1.4% a year. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods such as noodles, as well as Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With much of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports, with world trade expanding in most years. Although diets in the fastest-growing consumer markets are expected to diversify as incomes improve, to include additional animal proteins, dairy products and oil crops, in general there has been little evidence of slowing food wheat demand in recent years. We therefore expect world food use to rise by 1.5% in 2017/18, exceeding 500m tonnes for the first time. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa. These trends are well established and are expected to continue into 2018/19, when food consumption could rise to 511m tonnes.
Wheat is a key staple across South Asia
By tonnage, South Asia is the world's largest food wheat-consuming region, with cumulative consumption in 2017/18 projected at around 135m tonnes, equivalent to more than one-quarter of the global total. India is easily the largest single consumer, with wheat being a staple food for most of the population in northern, western and central growing areas. Most is consumed as unleavened flat breads, but western-style loaves, confectionery and bakery products are gaining in popularity. Consumption gains are underpinned by population growth, averaging 1.3% a year over the past decade, as well as various food-security programmes, under which grains are distributed to eligible beneficiaries at highly subsidised prices. Wheat food use in India in 2017/18 is projected to rise by 2%, to 93.5m tonnes (the majority of India's total wheat demand of 98.5m tonnes). For 2018/19 food demand is likely to rise further, to 95.4m tonnes. In Pakistan, where rice output is smaller, wheat is an even more important food staple, and consumption per head exceeds that of most countries with similar incomes. However, local diets are beginning to diversify, with demand for dairy and meat products rising strongly over the past decade.
World feed use is forecast at a higher than usual level in 2016/17
Wheat contains high levels of starch, which makes it a good, energy-rich ingredient for livestock feed. Demand for feed wheat shows more annual variation than that for food-use wheat, and is highly dependent on price and underlying quality considerations. Direct, on-farm feed use also varies from one year to the next, depending on the size and quality of the crop in a particular season. Use for feed has averaged around 141m tonnes a year during the past five years. Wheat is the world's second most important feed grain; although it is typically equivalent to one-quarter of feed-use of maize, with annual wheat use roughly matching that of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. The EU is typically the world's largest consumer of feed quality wheat, with consumption averaging close to 57m tonnes in recent seasons-around 40% of the world total. Other large users include Russia, with demand of around 17m tonnes, China (15m tonnes) and the US (5m tonnes). Depending on price, feed manufacturers in Asia, including South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, have also incorporated relatively large amounts into feed rations in recent years.
Assuming strong competition from maize-especially in the EU, China and the US-we expect use for livestock feed to fall back by 3.7% year on year in 2017/18, to around 144m tonnes. The figure for Canada is also forecast to be sharply lower than last year, dropping by about half, to 3m tonnes, on much smaller feed grade supplies. At the moment, we forecast a modest decline in global demand for feed-grade wheat in 2018/19, to around 144m tonnes. The drop stems mainly from a projected small decline in Russia, where a smaller crop is likely to limit discretionary on-farm feeding.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, with cumulative output hitting new highs each year between 2013/14 and 2016/17. Production gains have stemmed mainly from the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia, but China, India and parts of Latin America have also contributed bigger crops. The harvested area has increased across many parts of the globe, and average yields have also risen, despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat seed technology. However, given recent spells of poor weather across wheat belts in both hemispheres, the recent growth trend is expected to come to a halt. In 2017/18 we forecast global wheat production to decline by 0.9% year on year, to 748m tonnes, owing largely to lower output from the US, Canada and Australia. Nonetheless, this is a slight upward revision from our previous forecast (1.5% contraction), owing to improved prospects for several producers, including the EU, India, the US and Canada. Russia's massive 2017/18 crop has diverted some attention away from the fact that supplies of the best quality, high-protein wheats from North America and parts of Europe will be below average levels and will therefore command a price premium. The 2018/19 sowing season is now under way in some parts of the northern hemisphere. With prices at relatively low levels, there is unlikely to be much incentive for farmers to increase plantings. Crop rotation needs will again be important, but in countries where there are few alternatives, seeded area is unlikely to show much year-on-year change. Assuming average yields, the world crop is forecast to contract by another 0.8% in 2018/19, to 742m tonnes.
After a small EU crop last year, output should rise in 2017/18
Despite a mixed year for the main EU wheat growers, the 2017/18 crop is expected to be slightly larger than average. We have lifted our production forecast by a further 1.9m tonnes, to a total of 150.1m tonnes, incorporating latest official harvest data from France and Romania. Final results from the French harvest, which accounts for around one-quarter of the bloc's total output, were better than previously reported, with yields rebounding strongly from the previous season's sub-par results. Survey results have also confirmed its good quality, with a much higher percentage than last year meeting milling specifications. In contrast, a wet finish to the German harvest has led to a series of quality downgrades in key northern export-producing areas. As most of the EU crop is winter sown, producers are now gearing up for the start of 2018/19 planting. Farmers have again expressed concerns about market prices currently being lower than production costs. Some area may be switched to attractively priced rapeseed, but given the lack of viable alternatives for many farmers, we do not expect much change in plantings for next year's harvest. Assuming normal yields, output is likely to be in line with the average, at 148m tonnes.
An enormous crop in Russia
The size of this season's winter wheat crop in Russia has caught market observers by surprise. With farmers continuing to report astounding yields, local production estimates have been increasing on an almost daily basis. When harvesting of winter crops started a few months ago, early yields were good, surpassing the previous year's record by around 5%. As threshing progressed, the proportional improvement over the previous season continued to rise, and by the end of harvesting in late September average yields were up by about 17% year on year. Yields have been above or in line with record levels in all the major growing areas, with a particularly sharp improvement noted in the Volga District. Excellent yields are attributed mainly to abundant springtime rains, but with the crops also well established after a successful period of overwintering. Attention is now shifting to the lower-yielding spring-sown crops, grown predominantly in more northerly areas, in the Volga, Ural and Siberian Districts. Spring wheat production prospects are also favourable, with recent good moisture boosting yield potential. We maintain our forecast that Russia's 2017/18 wheat outturn will rise by nearly 13% year on year, to a record 82m tonnes. With large barley and maize crops also expected, the main issue facing exporters this year is one of logistical constraints. Although there are no definitive numbers, analysts have estimated that the country has the capacity to ship only up to 45m tonnes of grain, of which wheat might account for around three-quarters. Constraints are therefore likely to be felt across the supply chain, including storage silos, railcars and port infrastructure.
The fact that large volumes of wheat will be pouring into stockpiles this season could potentially be a disincentive to 2018/19 planting. However, given that international prices are still well above the cost of production in some areas, we expect the planted area to remain high in the coming season. Recent dry weather has not been ideal for early crop establishment but has allowed for a quick start to planting, and winter sowings stand to beat the official target again. Assuming that yields are similar to the recent trend, but down from the record-breaking results achieved this year, we expect 2018/19 output to decline by around 12%, to 72m tonnes, which is still an impressive outturn.
US wheat production fell sharply in 2017/18
US all-wheat production in 2017/18 totals 47.4m tonnes, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Small Grains Summary. This is slightly above earlier estimates but still down by 25% year on year, and at a fifteen-season low. The sharp drop in output mainly reflects a pullback in plantings, with the smallest harvested area in almost 130 years. The final crop estimate was 1.4m tonnes above our previous forecast, after US authorities confirmed slightly better yields and lower than expected abandonment from the spring harvest. The winter wheat outturn was 34.5m tonnes (down by 24% year on year), with durum at 1.5m tonnes (down by 47%) and other spring varieties at 10.7m tonnes (down by 27%). Sowing of next season's winter wheat crop is under way but making unusually slow progress so far. Recent rains across the central Plains were beneficial for germination, but slowed fieldwork in many key Hard Red Winter (HRW) wheat states. However, concerns about dryness lingered in Soft Red Winter wheat-producing zones across the Midwest. Depressed prices and limited potential for profits mean that another drop in winter and spring plantings is now likely. Assuming better overall yields, however, mainly for spring-sown wheat, 2018/19 production is forecast to rise by 4.9%, to 49.7m tonnes, about 11% below the previous five-year average.
Canada's production in 2017/18 is likely to drop significantly
For the first time in Canada, more area of the 2017/18 harvest was sown with canola than with wheat, traditionally the nation's number-one field crop. Updated official plantings data confirm that the 2017/18 all-wheat planted area declined to 6.4m ha, down by 4% year on year, with losses stemming mainly from a 16% drop in durum plantings. After a wet spring, hot and dry weather has since spread across southern and central parts of the Prairies, with Saskatchewan, the number-one provincial grower of spring wheat and durum, worst affected. By early October about three-quarters of the spring crop had been cut. Although poor results have been confirmed in southernmost parts of Saskatchewan, yields have exceeded expectations elsewhere, including in Manitoba, where crops appear to have benefitted from wet soils earlier on in the cropping season. Indeed, many operators have been surprised at just how well spring wheat yields have held up, given periods of extremely dry weather this year. Some local breeders have attributed this to the latest (non-genetically modified) wheat varieties, which appear to make more efficient use of available moisture and nitrogen fertilisers. We have therefore increased our forecast by a further 1.5m tonnes, to 27m tonnes, but this is still a 15% drop year on year. We currently expect a modest increase in overall area in 2018/19. Should yields also rise, output could increase by 7%, to 29m tonnes.
Australia has seen a poor start to the 2017/18 crop season
In Australia, winter wheat prospects took a turn for the worse in September as searing temperatures spread across eastern cropping areas, further depleting soil moisture in already dry fields, with parts of New South Wales and Queensland worst affected. With spring weather so crucial for yield formation, 2017/18 production prospects were probably badly affected. Production is forecast to drop to 20.5m tonnes, down by 42% year on year (36% previously). The scale of the fall is particularly dramatic because of the record crop in 2016/17, when plentiful rains pushed yields up by 45% year on year, to unprecedented highs.

Wheat is back in favour with Argentinian farmers
In Argentina, policy changes made under the government that come into power in late 2015, including exchange-rate liberalisation and the removal of export quotas and taxes, have greatly incentivised the country's wheat farmers. Planting of the 2017/18 crop was completed by late August, but with area falling short of earlier expectations. Flooding prevented access to low-lying fields across southern parts of Buenos Aires and La Pampa provinces, where as much as 150,000 ha of intended wheat area was thought to have gone unseeded. Some local sources recently estimated that around half of the country's total wheat area had been affected by excessive water this season, which hindered farmers' ability to control disease and apply fertilisers. With dryness also persisting in more northerly areas, 2017/18 wheat production is forecast to decline by at least 5% year on year, to 16.5m tonnes.
Stocks and prices
Cumulative world stocks are predicted to rise for the fifth consecutive season in 2017/18, reaching 251m tonnes, up by 4% year on year to an all-time high. However, this large total figure masks some important features, as gains in world inventories are mostly attributed to rises in end-season stocks in India and China, whose stocks are not available on the world market. Indeed, with China's stocks having doubled over a five-year period, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to use carryovers in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supplies. Cumulative stockpiles in those countries are forecast to drop by around 8% year on year, to 70m tonnes, but will still be up by 10% from the average in recent years. The projection for 2018/19 is provisional, but suggests a continuation of the most recent trend. World stocks are likely to remain high, and are currently unchanged compared with the previous year, at 251m tonnes, but with the outlook skewed by an even larger figure for China. Exporter stocks of 61.3m tonnes, although not considered especially tight, would be the smallest in five years.
China's wheat stocks are large, and likely to get larger
Discussions about grain stocks in China are usually centred on maize inventories, which have dominated the headlines in recent years. However, a steep rise in wheat and rice stockpiles has also been witnessed over the past decade. Although no definitive grain-stock data are made publicly available, it is thought that wheat inventories have risen from just below 40m tonnes in 2006/07 to a projected 111m tonnes at the end of the 2016/17 season, equivalent to around 95% of annual domestic consumption. Our projections suggest that inventories could rise to as much as 128m tonnes in 2017/18 and 141m tonnes in 2018/19. Similar to the maize market, policy has been the key driver behind this surge, with the government committed to defending a pre-set minimum price by buying local supplies for temporary reserves. Farmers receive the same price for all average-quality wheat, regardless of protein or gluten content, meaning that quality is generally fairly low. The reserves are stored, with the help of subsidies, until the grain can be auctioned off at a higher price.

Wheat prices are likely to remain weak in the short term
Trading in world wheat markets has been extremely volatile over the past four months or so. Initial steep gains, linked primarily to a drought in parts of the US and Canada, were later erased on the back of better than expected results from harvests in the Black Sea region, predominantly in Russia. Despite overall heavy world availabilities and strong competition for available export business, wheat prices at all major origins firmed during September, rising by an average of 5%. Gains in the US were tied partly to logistical issues in the wake of storm-related loading disruptions at the country's key Gulf ports, as well as heightened concerns about the outlook for crops in Australia and Argentina, which will potentially provide additional export opportunities. Buoyant overseas demand and logistical bottlenecks also shored up Black Sea export quotations, particularly in Russia, where port capacity is likely to be stretched this season. In addition, with some farmers said to have secured sufficient funds to cover near-term commitments, a number of producers were more reluctant to sell at current prices. With Russian shipments expected to remain high throughout the season, strong export competition is likely to keep a lid on prices, at least for next year. Assuming that crop prospects do not deteriorate further, we expect HRW export prices (12% protein, fob Gulf) to fall over the remainder of 2017 and in the first half of 2018, before strengthening slightly thereafter. However, higher protein supplies are expected to command a hefty price premium, at least until the next (2018/19) northern hemisphere crops enter the pipeline.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power in the wake of the installation of a Constituent Assembly, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power if either Chinese or Russian finance helps the sovereign to avoid debt default, or should Mr Maduro be replaced by another member of the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to appease critics.
We estimate that inflation will exceed 1,400% by end-2017 and 2,000% by end-2018, and forecast an overall contraction of GDP of one-third between 2014 and 2019. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption and operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2020-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production until 2019, followed by rising output from 2020 onwards as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making the country one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly hetero-dox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s t wo parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$11bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages, narrowing the current-account deficit to 0.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Even as Venezuela's economic crisis deepens, amid growing default and risk of hyperinflation, the governing Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has strengthened its hold on power as the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has slid into disarray and infighting. Despite economic crisis making the president, Nicolás Maduro, extremely unpopular, the government's history of electoral manipulation means that it is unlikely that the PSUV would leave power via normally scheduled, free and fair elections. Instead, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a more chaotic political transition process, most likely ushering the MUD into power by 2019.
The MUD's inability to effect change to date is explained by the PSUV's successful attempts at dividing the opposition and eliminating its influence in government and political institutions. Government tactics have included banning candidates, imprisoning popular opposition figures and stripping all power from the MUD-controlled National Assembly, which in August was superseded by a new Constituent Assembly (ANC). The ANC is formally concerned with rewriting the Constitution but has also taken over all legislative powers during its two-year remit. The ANC's members are all PSUV representatives. The latest blow came in the October regional elections, which were marred by what the opposition states was electoral fraud. The PSUV took 18 of 23 governorships available and successfully triggered infighting in the MUD when four governors-elect from Acción Democrática, an MUD member, agreed to be sworn in by the ANC.
The PSUV's future in power currently depends on the support of key backers. These include the state's coercive apparatus (the security forces and military); a sizeable sector of the population that is dependent on handouts of basic goods, including food; and activist groups (so-called colectivos), which are something between community organisers and PSUV paramilitaries. To remain in power, the government will need to ply these groups with resources, the vast majority of which come from PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. A prolonged interruption in exports by PDVSA would cause this support to waver while also increasing dissatisfaction in the populace, as it would exacerbate the pronounced shortages of basic goods and trigger an increase in inflation (already estimated at over 1,000%).
We believe that two main scenarios would lead to a drop in PDVSA exports and see the PSUV leave office as support wanes and unrest increases. The first involves a disorderedly default of sovereign and/or PDVSA external debt. Legal action in the US (as permitted by the debt contracts) could result in seizures of PDVSA's assets (such as those of PDVSA-owned Citgo). Such actions, if widespread, could curtail exports dramatically. We believe that PDVSA has taken defensive measures that may limit the effectiveness of seizures.
The second path to regime change is based on PDVSA's falling output. Output dipped to 1.9m barrels/day in October (it was 2.4m b/d in 2013, when Mr Maduro took office), and we expect production to continue dropping into 2018. On the basis that this trend continues and oil prices remain relatively subdued, we would expect PDVSA's US dollar earnings to continue to dwindle, eventually causing the support of the PSUV's backers to be withdrawn. There is a risk that the Maduro administration will avoid this fate, if sufficient Chinese, Indian or Russian investment in the sector supports output.
Given the level of political violence and the traumatic economic context that the country would find itself in were either main transition scenario to materialise, it would be difficult for the PSUV to appease critics by replacing Mr Maduro with another high-ranking PSUV figure. It also seems unlikely that the PSUV would quietly leave office via fair and free elections. Instead, the most likely transition scenario would involve the military pushing the PSUV out and restoring order while paving the way for eventual elections.
Regardless of how and when political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. The broad, diverse opposition coalition will have to contend with huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
A combination of victory in the gubernatorial elections and the MUD's disarray has emboldened the government, which has announced municipal elections for December 10th. The largest opposition parties will boycott the contests, meaning an almost guaranteed victory for the PSUV. However, the centralisation of power means that the results will have little impact on overall government policy.
Presidential elections are due on December 2018. Although the government has signalled in recent weeks that it may bring these forward (taking advantage of opposition disarray), we currently believe it more likely that the government will try to postpone them, using the excuse that the ANC's mandate runs until August 2019. Approval from the politicised Supreme Court would be forthcoming. Given the PSUV's history of electoral manipulation, a rigged election, or one with null opposition participation is a possibility. Regardless, both of our transition scenarios assume that relatively free and fair elections will be held following economic collapse, ushering the opposition into power.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Following the installation of the ANC in August, Venezuela has come under increasing regional and international pressure. The country has been suspended from Mercosur, a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, owing to "violations to the constitutional order". In addition, a regional group of 12 nations have declared both the October gubernatorial elections and the ANC vote illegitimate. The EU has also denounced the regime, banning weapons sales and condemning the "non-respect of democratic principles".
US sanctions remain the most relevant variable. Such sanctions have made it near-impossible for PDVSA or the government to renegotiate its debts. Given Venezuela's extreme dependency on trade with the US (Venezuela exports oil and imports distillates from the US), an embargo would cripple the economy and likely trigger one of our transition scenarios. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with China and Russia, who have provided financing to Venezuela as international markets have shunned the nation.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government's immediate economic policy concern will be fending off default and associated legal challenges. The government has gone into arrears on some sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including PDVSA), while also making late payments on others. It has restated its commitment to pay and blamed the delays on US sanctions and the payment system. The situation has been classified as technical default (a default that occurred earlier than our baseline forecast of 2018). The government has announced its intention to restructure existing debts. To this end, the government invited bondholders to a meeting on November 13th to restructure the debt, which produced no results. A successful restructuring by the Maduro regime appears impossible. This is partly because creditors will be unable to negotiate a deal with the many Venezuelan officials sanctioned by the US. More fundamentally, the Maduro regime has no economic or political programme underpinning restructuring that would be acceptable to creditors.
There is no sign yet of acceleration by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer late payment to lengthy legal battles. Eventually, this stance is likely to change. To avoid PDVSA asset seizures, the government may choose to default on sovereign bonds but adhere to PDVSA's repayment schedule. Sovereign creditors would undoubtedly ask US courts to define PDVSA as an "alter ego" of the government in order to seize its assets, but this would take time, pushing back asset seizures. In this environment, the timing of likely seizures is unclear. When they do happen, the consequences for import capacity will be devastating. We assume that they will trigger a transition of power and, eventually, a change of economic policy direction.
In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2018 than it has done so far. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or technically incapable of adjusting policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find.
Under our baseline scenario we expect the opposition to come to power in 2019 at the latest, ushering in much-needed, market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a non-financial public-sector deficit of 19.4% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 5.6% of GDP by 2022. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Under our baseline forecast of severe economic stress that would see an MUD-led opposition government in 2019, we expect a restructuring process with external creditors to happen.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits; money supply (M2) rose by 534% year on year in September, the highest rate on record. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government, which implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy, will see real interest rates turn positive.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-19, following an estimated contraction of 9.5% in 2017, Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-22 rests on an assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of a third in 2014-19.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink through 2019 as oil production falls further, but will pick up thereafter, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep recession. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 45.5% in October, bringing accumulated inflation for January-October to 826%. Assuming that price pressures remain high, we expect inflation to exceed 1,400% by year-end and reach over 2,000% by the end of 2018. We continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, under the assumption of a recovery in oil output and corrective economic policies under an MUD-led government. However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Currently, a dual exchange-rate system is in operation, comprising an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom, used for private-sector operations (but where demand for US dollars vastly outstrips supply). The Dicom was suspended in August, with Mr Maduro announcing the future usage of a "basket of currencies" (such as the rupee, rouble, yuan and euro) to replace the use of the dollar. However, the system is yet to be implemented, as the government seems to be hoarding all foreign-exchange available to meet its debt obligations. Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2018, but the exchange rate will remain extremely overvalued. The suspension of the Dicom, coupled with runaway money supply, has led to a spike in the black-market foreign-exchange rate, which reached BsF52,128:US$1 on November 12th.
We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We forecast a current-account deficit of 3.4% of GDP in 2018, as exports, held back by decaying infrastructure, falling oil production and lack of exploration, will be unable to offset imports, despite the government's best efforts at dampening them (we estimate that the value of imports in 2017 will be equivalent to a quarter of those of 2012). In 2019, with a new administration in place, exports and imports will begin a recovery; however, in the years ahead the latter will outstrip the former owing to years of pent-up demand and an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage. However, given increased imports, our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2022 reserves will cover less than two months of goods and services imports.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Following the snap general election on June 8th, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, the prime minister, Theresa May, formed a minority government based on a "confidence and supply" agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The government will be fragile, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect it to last a full five-year term; its working majority of 13 (down from 17 before the election) will be eroded by by-elections, and it will face domestic and external challenges during the Brexit process.
Mrs May's position has been greatly weakened by a series of scandals relating to the misconduct of members of parliament in late 2017-which led to the resignation of two ministers. There is a significant risk that tensions within the cabinet and the Conservative Party over the government's Brexit strategy will come to a head, resulting in a political crisis.
In March 2017 parliament approved Article 50, beginning the two-year process by which the UK will leave the EU. Mrs May said that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union, but her government will face pressure to soften the terms of Brexit. The government will aim to reach a deal on the new UK-EU trading relationship by March 2019. At that stage the UK will leave the single market, and the terms of the new relationship will be phased in gradually. If negotiations fail and no extension of the deadline is agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without any deal in place and will revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules.
The economy has been resilient in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, we expect growth to slow to 1.6% in 2017 as rising inflation and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations dampen domestic demand. We forecast average real GDP growth of 1.5% per year in 2018-19 as the economy adjusts, picking up to an average of 1.9% per year in 2020-22.
We expect the government's budget deficit to widen to 3.3% of GDP this year, after narrowing to 2.9% in 2016 (from 4.3% in 2015). A deficit will persist throughout the forecast period (2017-22). In November 2017 the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) raised interest rates for the first time in a decade, but is likely to go into wait-and-see mode for the duration of the Brexit negotiations, before moving to normalise policy again in mid-2019.

The UK's business environment score rises in 2018-22 compared with 2013-17, and the UK rises three places in the global and regional rankings. The Brexit vote has introduced some policy uncertainty. However, the UK's traditional strengths as a business location-a pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will endure.
Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Lloyds, one of two banks rescued post-crisis by the state, returns to full private ownership; government retains big stake in struggling Royal Bank of Scotland. Brexit focus constrains reforms to improve weak trends in investment and productivity.
2020-22: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks post-Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Business lobbying for government "assurances" will intensify during Brexit talks. Government pursues policies to encourage foreign direct investment inflows.
2020-22: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Informal talks begin on post-Brexit UK-EU free-trade agreement, alongside divorce negotiations. UK leaves EU single market (and probably customs union). Possible disruption to crossborder trade. Risk of no deal, with UK subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules.
2020-22: Terms of new UK-EU trading arrangement phased in.
Taxes
2018-19: Gradual rise in total tax burden, alongside further reduction in corporate tax rate. Changes to system of business rates. Possible tax incentives to encourage investment and prevent companies from relocating outside UK prior to Brexit.
2020-22: Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to tax evasion. Possible tax increases to support the public finances.
Financing
2018-19: Modest tightening in financial conditions likely in run-up to Brexit. Loose monetary policy persists. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Demand for alternative forms of debt financing.
2020-22: Availability of finance unchanged. Possible loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade.
The labour market
2018-19: Firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Possible modest decline in inflows of EU workers. New apprenticeship levy and phased increase in compulsory "national living wage". Wage growth remains subdued.
2020-22: Some form of restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but most likely flexible in response to business concerns. Policymakers struggle to respond to weak productivity and deficit in intermediate skills.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operating.
2020-22: Construction continues on contentious high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. Steady decline in EU-funded investment activity across the UK.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The union between the UK's constituent nations will come under pressure when the UK leaves the EU. The Conservatives will devolve more powers to Scotland and introduce a system of "English votes for English laws". The status of Northern Ireland has become more uncertain. The main opposition Labour Party increased its parliamentary seats by 30 in the June 2017 snap general election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws parliamentary constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis, with an exceptionally loose monetary stance and unprecedented fiscal retrenchment. Real GDP growth accelerated in 2014, but momentum slowed in 2015-16. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging impact on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Managing Brexit could force policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 20% since April 2015. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (increased from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2016 exports of goods totalled US$407.3bn and imports amounted to US$588.4bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$181.1bn. The traditional services surplus fell to US$131.1bn. The overall current-account deficit narrowed in absolute terms, to US$115.5bn, from US$122.6bn in 2015, although it edged higher as a share of GDP, to 4.3%, from 4.2%.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The decision of the prime minister, Theresa May, to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May's authority was further undermined by a calamitous speech at the Conservative Party conference in October, prompting calls by some in the party for a leadership contest. However, Mrs May will stay in place for now because there is no obvious alternative who could unite both wings of the party. The Conservatives fear another general election given that the momentum is with the main opposition Labour Party. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last the duration of the Brexit negotiations, until March 2019, and there is a significant risk of another pre-term election.
The Conservatives have formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). This arrangement is likely to work in the short term because neither party wants another election, they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the government's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
In early November 2017 the government was rocked by a series of scandals. Allegations of sexual misconduct by members of parliament led to the resignation of Michael Fallon as defence secretary on November 1st, and to Damian Green, the first secretary of state, being placed under investigation. Then on November 9th Priti Patel resigned from her position as international development secretary after failing to follow ministerial procedures and disclose a series of meetings held with politicians and lobbyists on a recent trip to Israel.
Mrs May's authority has been further undermined by these events, which prompted a mini-reshuffle of her cabinet. Divisions in the cabinet over Brexit are putting further strain on the government and represent a significant threat to political stability. Brexiteers in the cabinet and the Conservative Party have been supportive of Mrs May since the election because they want her to hold fast to her earlier pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This faction includes the Brexit secretary, David Davis; the international trade secretary, Liam Fox; the environment minister, Michael Gove; and the foreign affairs minister, Boris Johnson. They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit, who favour an extended post-2019 transition period during which the UK retains single market access, including the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond; the home secretary, Amber Rudd; and Mr Green. Cabinet divisions over Brexit have intensified in recent months and could prove difficult to contain if the Brexit negotiations become deadlocked, possibly leading to a leadership challenge and the collapse of the government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
A snap general election was held on June 8th 2017, three years ahead of schedule. Mrs May's decision to call the election was a political miscalculation, resulting in the Conservatives losing 13 seats, leaving them with 318 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons (the lower house of parliament). The Labour Party won 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 parliamentary seats.
The DUP, which increased its share of parliamentary seats from eight to ten, became kingmaker. The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost 21 seats as the Conservatives and Labour both made a comeback in Scotland. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, overplayed her hand in pressing for a second independence referendum, which was not popular, and suffered from the SNP's poor record in power. The Liberal Democrats won 12 seats, up from eight in 2015. Sinn Fein won seven seats, but does not take its seats in parliament.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
The Brexit negotiations will shape the UK's international relations during The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast period (2018-22) and beyond. On March 29th the UK invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, beginning the formal two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the bloc. In line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and the budget, the UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019, but we expect the new relationship to be phased in gradually, to minimise disruption. This could mean continued adherence to EU rules for a period after withdrawal. The UK would like to have tariff-free access to EU markets, but customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and would prevent the UK from negotiating trade deals with non-EU countries. The UK has proposed alternatives to customs union membership, including a "highly streamlined" arrangement and a new customs "partnership" that reduce non-tariff barriers to trade such as technical regulations, compliance requirements and rules of origin documentation.
Negotiations over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU are in deadlock over issues relating to citizens' rights, avoiding a border in Northern Ireland and, in particular, on the matter of the financial settlement. Mrs May has proposed that during a two-year transition period after March 2019, the UK could match the net financial contribution that it would have made to the end of the current EU budget phase in 2020 had it remained a member of the EU. However, the EU wants a settlement on long-term budgetary commitments that the UK is not prepared to provide at this stage.
As expected, the EU summit on October 19th-20th concluded that insufficient progress had been made on first-round issues (relating to the divorce) for trade talks to begin. However, EU leaders gave the "green light" to begin internal preparations for this. A breakthrough by the December summit is looking increasingly unlikely, as both sides refuse to budge on the financial settlement, but we expect talks to move to the next stage in early 2018.
Political exigencies on both sides reduce the scope for an amicable divorce and the risk that the negotiations will break down is high. If they do, and an extension of the Article 50 deadline is not agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal and revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules. However both sides have an incentive to agree a deal, given the mutual benefits of maintaining economic, political and security relations.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The Brexit vote will encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infrastructure. Mr Hammond announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and development over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. There will also be a new effort to improve vocational skills. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are too modest in size and scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The political pressure to ease austerity has increased since the government's poor performance in the election. In response, Mr Hammond may be tempted to spend some of the windfall from a better than expected fiscal performance this year in the forthcoming autumn budget, to be presented on November 22nd. However, policy adjustments since the last fiscal statement, in March, and likely downward revisions to the growth and productivity forecasts look set to make future deficit reduction more difficult to achieve. As a result, we do not expect big spending plans to be announced. Mr Hammond has also indicated that deficit reduction will remain a priority and the government may want to hold something in reserve for later, once the Brexit negotiations are concluded.
In the wake of the Paradise Papers data leak, the budget may also place a greater emphasis on measures to crack down on tax evasion and non-compliance. Mr Hammond is likely to focus on the progress made so far in reducing the so-called tax gap between the amount due and the amount collected, which reached a record low in the 2014/15 fiscal year.
The government's fiscal position improved in 2016, but we estimate that the deficit will expand to 3.3% of GDP in 2017, from 2.9% last year, and stay at around that level in 2018 as the government eases off from its austerity drive. Automatic stabilisers will push up spending on social transfers as unemploy-ment increases. However, revenue will still be rising, and in the remainder of our forecast period the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to narrow to 2% by 2020 and 1.7% by 2022. The public debt burden edged up to 88.3% of GDP in 2016, from 88.2% in 2015. We forecast that public debt will peak at just below 92% of GDP in 2019, before falling thereafter.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
At its meeting in November, a majority of members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted in favour of increasing the main policy interest rate-for the first time in a decade-by 25 basis points, to 0.5%. There had been no material change in the MPC's assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation in its November Inflation Report since the previous report, in August. Rather, the bank responded to a continuation of positive trends and reversed the rate cut from last year.
Diminished supply capacity within the economy also played into the MPC's decision, which it viewed as necessary to bring inflation back to target in the medium term and prevent a further squeeze in real incomes. However, downside risks to the outlook persist, particularly around the Brexit adjustment. The bank is therefore likely to keep monetary policy accommodative and go into wait-and-see mode following the latest decision.
We now expect the BoE to move again to normalise policy earlier than previously assumed, in the third quarter of 2019 rather than early 2021. The stock of asset purchases-made up of £435bn (US$574bn) of government bonds and £10bn of corporate bonds-will remain unchanged.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
The economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth in 2016 was firm, at 1.8%. The latest GDP data point to a slowdown in the UK economy in 2017. A preliminary estimate of real GDP for the third quarter of 2017 shows that it increased by 0.4% quarter on quarter, and by 1.5% year on year, down from 1.8% year-on-year growth in the first quarter. Rising cost pressures and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU are likely to weigh more heavily on economic activity later this year. We therefore expect a slowdown in the pace of economic growth, to 1.6%.
UK consumer spending has been resilient in the face of a squeeze on household disposable incomes from falling real wages. This reflects higher tourism spending, employment gains and high levels of consumer borrowing. Nevertheless, the trend in retail sales has weakened: over the first nine months of 2017 annual sales volume growth averaged 2.2%-well below the full-year growth rate of 4.7% recorded in 2016. We assume that consumers and businesses will delay spending decisions in response to heightened uncertainty. After private consumption growth of 2.8% in 2016, we expect growth of 1.6% in 2017. A resilient trend in business sentiment has supported investment growth in the first half of this year, and we expect it to accelerate to 2.1%, from 1.3% in 2016, before slowing in 2018-19 as uncertainty increases as the difficulties of the Brexit negotiations become more evident. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to decelerate to 1.5% in 2018-19.
Mitigating the extent of the economic slowdown this year and in 2018 will be a deceleration in the pace of import growth as export volumes benefit from the depreciation of sterling. A deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU is likely to be phased in from 2019. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to accelerate to 2.1% on average in 2021-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
In April-September the headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-fluctuated between 2.6% and 2.8%, up from 1.9% in January. The acceleration partially reflects the recovery in oil prices at the beginning of the year, but has been amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote. With retailers passing on high input costs to customers, we expect inflation to exceed 3% in the coming months-well above the BoE's official 2% target. We expect inflation to average 2.7% in 2017 and remain high at 2.5% in 2018, even though domestic price pressures are likely to weaken. Thereafter we forecast that inflation will ease to 2% on average in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit newsflow means that the value of the pound has remained volatile, albeit within a range of US$1.20-1.27:£1 until April 18th, when Mrs May called the snap election. This initially boosted the value of the pound, but it fell back sharply in June in response to the shock result. The pound appreciated to US$1.35:£1 by mid-September, after a stronger than expected inflation outturn and commentary from the BoE that revived expect-ations of tighter monetary policy, but slipped back to US$1.33:£1 after the fifth round of Brexit talks ended in deadlock. We forecast that sterling will depreciate against the US dollar and the euro on average in the next couple of years as the economy slows. However, we expect the pound to make a gradual recovery against the dollar in the final years of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The merchandise trade balance will keep the current account in deficit through-out 2017-22, offsetting surpluses on the services account. However, we expect a relatively sharp narrowing of the deficit, from an estimated 4.4% of GDP in 2017 to 4% in 2022, reflecting continued growth in goods exports and a shift in the primary income balance as the under-performance of the UK economy reduces income debits (the return that foreign residents receive on their investments in the UK) relative to credits (the return that UK residents receive from their foreign direct investment). Despite a decline in secondary transfers as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget in 2021, weaker exports to the EU will lead to a modestly expanding current-account deficit in the final years of the forecast period.

Abstract: In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity. Since the failed coup, Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [...]the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the narrow referendum vic-tory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened social and political divisions.
The presidential reform, which is due to take effect after the next pres-idential and parliamentary elections, in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity.
Since the failed coup, Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies.
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of tighter global liquidity. A recovery began in the fourth quarter of 2016, supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth to accelerate to an estimated 5.5% in 2017 and to average 4.2% in 2018-22.
We estimate that the Turkish lira will average TL3.64:US$1 in 2017, a fall of 17% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.12:US$1 in 2022. In response, we expect that the Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep a tight monetary policy stance throughout 2018.
We expect the current-account deficit to widen slightly in the forecast period compared with 2016 and remain sufficiently large to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but the country's global ranking falls by 13 places, to 58th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Important shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities, and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, have been announced for 2018, to curb the rise in the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concerns about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey cannot be ruled out.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely following the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%, but could rise to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The political outlook for 2018-22 will be dominated by a series of crucial votes in 2019, after which an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parliamentary system. Municipal elections are due to be held in March, and parliamentary and presidential elections in November. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. Failure to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving Turkey to a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
Although the intense political instability that followed the failed coup has eased partially since the April referendum, we expect renewed social and political instability during the period up to and beyond the 2019 elections. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, has further polarised the country. It has also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and the AKP are losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place for the foreseeable future because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish Armed Forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
We expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the municipal, presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019. Although there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and his party has the ability to control the election process. Moreover, the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round, with just over 50% of the vote, against a joint candidate presented by the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties will consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election. The charismatic Meral Aksener, who has broken away from the MHP, is a possible challenger. She has formed a new centre-right party, the Good Party, and declared that she would run against Mr Erdogan in the presidential election. However, it is unlikely that she will win. She would have to have the support of the CHP and attract votes from incompatible constituencies, including Kurds and nationalists, who currently vote for the AKP.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
There is a growing risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding concerns that under the leadership of Mr Erdogan and the AKP the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of Syrian Kurdish groups, which Turkey regards as terrorist organisa-tions affiliated to the PKK; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of Turkey's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably his push to become president with executive powers after the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.
We expect that Turkey and its Western allies will seek to avoid a complete breakdown in relations, which could materialise if, among other things, the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, Turkey closes the Incirlik airbase to US forces or it withdraws from NATO. However, if tensions remain at current levels for a prolonged period Turkey's strategic relationships with the EU and the US are likely to suffer irreparable damage, and become increasingly antagonistic and transactional.
The spillover of violence from the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq will continue to pose serious domestic and external security threats to Turkey. In addition to terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey by IS and the PKK, which has camps in the mountains in northern Iraq, Turkey now has military forces de-ployed in two areas in Syria, ostensibly as part of the fight against IS but also to prevent US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds from establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions. The level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows to Turkey during the forecast period (2018-22). These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016 and early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy in November 2016 after a prolonged period of loosening. The lira has recovered the ground that it lost in January 2017, but it remains vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, as illustrated by short, sharp drops in value against the US dollar in July and October, probably prompted by expectations of balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region. If the lira depreciates sharply again, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary to halt the slide. However, this is not our baseline scenario, as we currently expect US monetary policy to be tightened only gradually in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit- and public debt-to-GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.2% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing, to 1.5% in 2022. Although the government debt/GDP ratio edged up slightly in 2016, to 29.2%, we expect it to decline gradually, to 27.6% in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates in order to revive economic activity has eased as the government has switched its atten-tion to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance-sheet tapering. To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and has increased funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25% in late April, where it has remained. Since then the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has been about 12%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy caused by the failed coup last July, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect growth to accelerate to 5.5% in 2017 and to average 4.2% in 2018-22. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. There are downside risks to this forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government in the next few years does not lead to further political instability, deterring foreign capital flows into the Turkish economy.
We expect a moderate improvement in household confidence, a recovery in employment growth and possible additional government incentives to support household spending. We forecast average real private consumption growth of 3.4% in 2017-22.
We expect government consumption growth to slow from an estimated 7% in 2017 to a still solid annual average of 6% per year in 2018-19 as the government continues to support the economy ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate, but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure projects, generating real growth of 6% per year in 2017-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-22. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourism sector. Our expectation is that a slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disin-flationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2021. There are upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Amid further bouts of volatility we estimate that the lira will depreciate against the US dollar in 2017, to an annual average of TL3.64:US$1, a fall of 17% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.12:US$1 in 2022. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-22. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account deficit to widen moderately and remain large enough, at an average of 4.4% of GDP per year in 2017-22, to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in 2017, but the sector is likely to take several years to recover to its 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Abstract: [...]the country remains in 11th place in the regional ranking but loses one place in the global ranking, dropping to 18th. [...]we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election was held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP's new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, propelled his party into first place. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The SPÖ has already announced its intention to go into opposition.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government would not lead to similar EU sanctions as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
We expect any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just above 71% by 2022, from an estimated 79.8% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.5% in 2016. We estimate an acceleration of growth this year, to 2.9%, and forecast that growth will moderate to 1.7% on average in 2018-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we expect an annual average of 2% in 2017-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain relatively stable in the forecast period, at 2.2% of GDP on average in 2017-22.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). As a result, the country remains in 11th place in the regional ranking but loses one place in the global ranking, dropping to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities were to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best under any next government, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and led the party to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, with 31.5% of the vote, up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its vote share by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In the coming weeks or months The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a coalition to emerge consisting of the ÖVP and the FPÖ, led by Mr Kurz as chancellor. Although technically a majority coalition including the SPÖ would be possible, either in the form of another grand coalition or an SPÖ-FPÖ coalition, the party has already indicated that it will go into opposition. Mr Kurz has stated that he could also form a minority government should negotiations fail. However, there is little precedent for this in Austria. The ÖVP and the FPÖ have already started negotiations, and the fact that the parties' programmes are quite close (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly criticised Mr Kurz for stealing the FPÖ's programme) should help them to reach an agree-ment. The president, who has a relatively large role in the government forma-tion process, including the right to veto ministerial appointees, could still block the formation of a right-wing government, although this is not our core forecast.
Although we thus expect a chancellor from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Although the two parties share common ground on several issues, we expect the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters and the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. It was won by the ÖVP, who we expect to form a government with the FPÖ. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit until the end of the term of the new Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) in late 2022.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that any government under him will have to be pro-EU, and we therefore do not expect Austria's EU membership to be questioned in the coming years. The FPÖ has also moderated its critique of the EU. We expect Austria to be a leading voice in the EU in the coming years, especially on reform of migration into the bloc. This should not lead to significant tensions, however, as it is likely to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries, Italy and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages; and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, little progress was made. The next govern-ment, which we expect to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.4% in 2013, and public debt rose to 83.7% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.5%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.8% in 2017 to just above 71% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that will run at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The economic recovery in the euro zone has strengthened this year and has become more broad based. We expect a healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 2.2%, after growth of 1.9% on average in 2015-16. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, but maintains a clearly dovish policy stance, with the reduction in the amount of monthly QE purchases in 2018 designed to extend its presence in the bond markets. The bank also plans to delay raising interest rates and reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities for a period well beyond the end of the QE programme. We expect the pace of monthly QE purchases to be reduced to zero in early 2019, but owing to subdued price pressure and persistent downside risks to growth, we forecast that the bank will delay raising policy rates until 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers, and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 1.1% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.5%, it remained below Germany's 1.8% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.7% between July 2016 and June 2017. Although the labour market had in previous years struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, in part owing to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.7% this year. Furthermore, export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 2.9% this year, above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have been a one-off. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy-price base effects fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016 and in 2017, when we estimate full-year average inflation of 2.1%. Recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, and the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. We expect the euro to appreciate further in 2022 as the monetary policy tightening cycle begins.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-16, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect the trade balance to move into a modest deficit from 2017 as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, we expect the services balance largely to outweigh the weakening trade balance and the current-account surplus to remain broadly flat throughout 2017-22, at about 2.2% of GDP on average.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power after the installation of a Constituent Assembly, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse (probably as foreign-exchange shortages culminate in debt default) or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling to power if either Chinese or Russian finance helps the sovereign to avoid debt default, or should Mr Maduro be replaced by another member of the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to appease critics.
We estimate year-on-year inflation to exceed 1,000% by end-2017 and 1,900% at end-2018. We forecast that GDP will have contracted by a third between 2014 and 2019. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consump-tion and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2020, assuming that a new government takes power and that implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production until 2019, followed by rising output from 2020 onwards as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly hetero-dox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists. A new government in 2019 brings new policies
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$7bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages, narrowing the current-account deficit to 1.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Political and social tension will remain high following a controversial vote on July 30th organised by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to establish a Constituent Assembly (ANC) with powers over all branches of government-including the opposition-controlled National Assembly-and a remit to write a new constitution. However, protests led by the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) opposition between April and July over the country's slide towards authoritarian government (the protests led to over 120 civilian deaths, mostly caused by the security forces) have died down as the MUD's focus shifts briefly to state governorship elections scheduled for October 15th. The scale of protests is likely to wax and wane in response to government measures to stifle democratic procedures, and those that are likely to persist will be from more violent and hardline youth groups of the opposition, known as the "Resistencia".
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a change of government at some point in the forecast period. The government will resist holding the presidential election that is due in December 2018. It seems unconcerned about ever more damning criticism from the international community, including a threat of further US economic sanctions after the imposition of financial constraints in late August. Nonetheless, we do not expect Mr Maduro to manage to cling to power for the entire 2018-22 forecast period, on the basis that economic conditions seem set to deteriorate further, with Venezuela already on the brink of hyperinflation and default. These conditions will generate an unsustainable level of pressure, resulting in a change of government. International oil prices are not expected to rise sufficiently to provide the foreign-exchange proceeds needed to ease chronic consumer goods shortages (Venezuela depends heavily on imports) and allow the government to meet external debt obligations falling due over the next 12-15 months. We therefore believe that a transition involving the opposition is likely in the medium term.
Given the highly volatile political situation, accurately forecasting when and how a transition of power will occur is challenging. We believe that there are two main triggers to a transfer of authority. The first involves a traumatic descent into hyperinflation and default. In this scenario, Mr Maduro could manage to muddle through for the remainder of 2017 and much of 2018, running down reserves to meet external debt repayments, before ultimately being unable to avoid default, perhaps in the context of the imposition of sanctions by the US on Venezuela oil imports. This would be likely to bring about Mr Maduro's downfall, as his allies in government and the military would be hit financially, and remaining popular support from his constituents (chiefly the poor and public-sector workers) would fade owing to heightened economic hardship as hand-outs dry up. Subsequently, a negotiated exit for key government figures would pave the way for the holding of fresh elections and an eventual victory for the MUD.
The second of the most likely potential transition scenarios involves a military coup, triggered by dissent among the ranks of the armed forces. Although successive PSUV governments have given increasing power to the generals and trained lower-ranking soldiers that share their ideology, unease among other stakeholders in the armed forces appears to be growing, judging by sporadic episodes of rebellion in recent months. In this scenario, a military government could replace the current PSUV leadership, although we would expect such a government to pave the way for free and fair elections relatively quickly.
Although it is not our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk that the PSUV will cling on to power. If, for example, Russia or China were to provide sufficient financial assistance to allow Venezuela to avoid default and boost oil output, or if oil prices were to rise significantly beyond our expectations, there is a possibility that the government would manage to withstand political pressure for elections and regime change. In another possible scenario, Mr Maduro could leave office but be replaced by another high-ranking PSUV official in an attempt to appease critics. However, no likely successor to Mr Maduro would appease opposition demands for elections and political transition, and tension would remain high.
Regardless of when and how political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. The broad, diverse opposition coalition will have to contend with huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party. Although we expect significant financial support from multilateral lending agencies, the risk of renewed political volatility will remain high, even under an opposition government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
In both of our transition scenarios we assume that elections will eventually be held and will be relatively free and fair, ushering the MUD-led opposition into power. However, as part of the government's efforts to cling to power in the meantime, we expect that the Maduro regime and the ANC will push back the schedule for the next presidential election, which is due in December 2018. The ANC began work in August and has a two-year mandate, so at the very least elections could be pushed back to August 2019, with approval from the politicised Supreme Court likely to be forthcoming. State governor elections are scheduled for October 15th, and we expect the MUD to do well. However, the centralisation of power means that the results will have little impact on overall government policy.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Following the installation of the ANC, Venezuela has become much more isolated diplomatically and is coming under increasing regional and international pressure. To date, this has done little to weaken the government's grip on power, but US sanctions could prove significant. After ratcheting up individual sanctions on key government figures in recent months, the US administration has escalated this policy and, in late August, restricted the government's financing by barring dealings in new debt with both the government and PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. There is a growing likelihood of other economic measures such as cuts in US exports of distillates that Venezuela needs for its oil exports, which would lift costs and hence reducing foreign-exchange proceeds. Ultimately, the US could cut purchases of Venezuelan oil, a move that would cripple the economy.
Mercosur, a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, has suspended Venezuela indefinitely owing to "violations to the constitutional order", and a group of major countries in the region has denounced the regime and said that they will not recognise laws passed by the new ANC. The Vatican, which has in the past tried to mediate between the Venezuelan government and opposition, has also criticised the ANC. After some progress in mid-September, a new round of internationally-mediated talks between the MUD and the government seems to have stalled. Talks may restart in coming weeks, but huge obstacles remain to a negotiated exit to the political crisis.
A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with China (a key creditor) and Russia, whose state oil company, Rosneft, is active in Venezuela. Financial assistance from these countries could help the Maduro regime to survive for longer by providing much-needed external financing in exchange for lucrative oil contracts for Rosneft.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without significant policy adjustments. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2018 than it has done so far. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or technically incapable of adjusting policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention-ism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA. However, given an extremely thin reserves cushion (less than US$10bn by late September, most of which is held in gold), we have now factored into our forecasts the likelihood of a debt default in 2018, which would have dramatic consequences in the form of lower oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
In our baseline scenario, we expect the opposition to hold power by 2019, ushering in much-needed, market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of US$19bn in 2019-22. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. We estimate a non-financial public sector deficit of 19.5% of GDP for 2017 and expect the deficit to remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.4% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; money supply (M2) rose by 452% year on year in August, the highest rate on record. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Our forecasts now assume that Venezuela will default on its external debt at some stage in 2018. This will be followed by a restructuring process with external creditors under an MUD-led opposition government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative until 2019. After that, our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government, which implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy, will see real interest rates turn positive.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after an estimated contraction of 9.3% in 2017, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-19. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-22 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession. Our forecasts there-fore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of a third in 2014-19.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of soaring inflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink through 2019 as oil production falls further, but will pick up thereafter, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 33.7% in August, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January---August to 366%. Assuming that price pressures remain high, we expect inflation to exceed 1,000% by year-end and reach over 1,900% by the end of 2018. We continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, under the assumption of a recovery in oil output and corrective economic policies under an MUD-led government. However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
In late August, Mr Maduro announced the implementation of a "basket of currencies" (such as the rupee, rouble, yuan and euro) for international transactions to avoid the use of the US dollar. The basket of currencies will include currencies that are not easily convertible, meaning that this will probably make external transactions even more complicated. Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2018, but the exchange rate will remain extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom, used for private-sector operations (but where demand for US dollars vastly outstrips supply). After the government unexpectedly announced a suspension of the Dicom system in early September, the black-market rate shot up; it was BsF23,781:US$1 on September 25th.
We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We forecast the current-account deficit will be 4% of GDP in 2018, as exports, held back by decaying infrastructure, falling oil production and lack of exploration, will be unable to offset imports, despite the government's best efforts at dampening them (we estimate that the value of imports in 2017 will be equivalent to one-third of those of 2012). In 2019, with a new administration in place, exports and imports will begin a recovery; however, in the years ahead the latter will outstrip the former owing to years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage. However, given increased imports, our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2022 reserves will cover less than two months of goods and services imports.

Abstract: [...]the country remains in 11th place in the regional ranking but loses one place in the global ranking, dropping to 18th. [...]we expect little progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high. [...]we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% this year, slightly above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017b 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c 2022c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.0 Labour force (% change) 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 0.7 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.0 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.8 Employment (% change) 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.9 1.3 0.9 0.6 0.5 0.3 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.6 8.1 7.6 7.3 6.8 6.5 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 5.4 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.4 5.2 4.9 4.8 4.4 4.2 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.2 1.5 1.3 1.5 1.8 1.2 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.0 Producer prices (av) -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 1.7 1.3 1.9 2.6 2.4 1.8 GDP deflator (av) 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.2 1.5 1.3 1.5 1.8 1.2 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.2 2.1 1.4 1.3 2.0 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.7 Government consumption deflator (av) 1.2 1.5 1.6 1.5 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.0 Fixed investment deflator (av) 1.6 1.5 1.6 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 1.7 1.7 1.7 Average nominal wages 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.7 2.1 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.6 Average real wages 0.4 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.3 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 1.0 0.4 0.5 -0.3 -0.7 -0.3 -0.2 0.0 -0.1 -0.4 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 4.3 0.5 -16.1 -0.6 1.7 3.1 -1.7 3.5 0.3 2.7 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.1 36.9 37.9 39.0 40.1 41.2 Labour costs per hour (US$) 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 40.9 43.3 43.8 46.6 48.1 51.0 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election will be held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP's new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, propelled his party into first place in the polls. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to win the largest vote share. The most likely coalition to emerge is one that is led by the ÖVP and includes the Freedom Party (FPÖ), although negotiations to form one could be fraught.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government would not lead to similar EU sanctions as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
We expect any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.6% in 2016. We estimate an acceleration of growth this year, to 2.5%, and forecast that growth will moderate to 1.6% on average in 2018-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we forecast an annual average of 2% in 2017-22.
In 2016 the current-account surplus decreased slightly, to 1.7% of GDP. We forecast that it will average about 2.3% in 2018-22 as a weakening trade balance continues to be offset by strong tourism receipts.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22). As a result, the country remains in 11th place in the regional ranking but loses one place in the global ranking, dropping to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between EU and UK.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

a Actual.
Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election will be held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities were to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best under any next government, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Following several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP and will run as the party's lead candidate in the early general election on October 15th. However, probably owing to the party's poor performance in the polls (it has languished in third place since the first half of 2016), Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the ÖVP and that the party appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party", which would also include a number of people not previously associated with the ÖVP. Following Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) to third place, from first. The campaign still holds some potential to derail Mr Kurz's efforts, as he is inexperienced, especially on topics relating to economic policy, an area in which his main challenger, the current SPÖ chancellor, Christian Kern, is significantly stronger. However, owing in part to the ÖVP's lead (it is polling around 33%, compared with 24% for the second-placed SPÖ), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
Nevertheless, the election will be a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP will have been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the break-down of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be mostly drawing voters away from the FPÖ, in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens; NEOS, a liberal party; and List Pilz, a new group recently set up by Peter Pilz, a former Green member of parliament (MP)-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook remain, as the election could turn, and coalition negotiations could falter because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters and the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect little progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for October 15th 2017. The most likely scenario is that the rebranded ÖVP under Mr Kurz will win the largest share of the vote-but not an outright majority-and subsequently form a coalition with the FPÖ.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states, regardless of the composition of the coalition that emerges after the election.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries, Italy and the Netherlands.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Norbert Hofer, the FPÖ candidate-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages; and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, little progress has been made. The next govern-ment, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.4% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2018-22), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016 following a positive contribution from the Heta deal, to about 74% in 2022. In the context of the quantitative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a EUR60bn per month quantitative easing (QE) programme, which will run until the end of 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro zone has strengthened in the first half of 2017-supported by an acceleration in credit growth and a decline in unemployment-and looks to be more broad-based. We expect a healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 2.2%, after growth of 1.9% on average in 2015-16. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, and has revealed that it may make an announcement on the future of its QE programme in October. We maintain our view that the bank will begin to wind down gradually, or "taper", the programme in 2018. Nevertheless, underlying price pressure remains relatively subdued, and downside risks to wage growth and the global economy during that year could yet slow the pace at which the ECB will reduce its monthly asset purchases. We forecast that the ECB will raise policy rates in 2022, although there is a high risk that this move will be brought forward to 2021.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers, and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, it remained below Germany's 1.8% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.7% between July 2016 and June 2017. Although the labour market had in previous years struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.9% this year. Furthermore, export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% this year, slightly above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, when we forecast that the economy will expand by 1.9%. In the following years we expect a moderation of growth. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy-price base effects fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we estimate full-year average inflation of 2%. Recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. We expect the euro to appreciate further in 2022 as the monetary policy tightening cycle begins.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and moved the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect the trade deficit to widen gradually in the coming years as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in 2017-22, of about 2.4% of GDP on average.

Abstract: In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity. Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [...]the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the narrow referendum vic-tory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened social and political divisions.
The presidential reform, which is due to come into effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity.
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies.
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of tighter global liquidity. A recovery began in the fourth quarter of 2016, supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth to accelerate to an estimated 5.5% in 2017 and to average 4.4% in 2018-21.
We estimate that the Turkish lira will average TL3.61:US$1 in 2017, a fall of about 16% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.1:US$1 in 2022. In response, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to keep a tight monetary policy stance throughout 2018.
We expect the current account to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but the country's global ranking falls by 13 places, to 58th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, domestic political tension has created uncertainty about the direction of policy. Important shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion. The failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rates remain largely unchanged.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey cannot be ruled out.
2020-22: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners have eased.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely following the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased only partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened social and political divisions. Opposition demonstrations and rallies have been peaceful, but there is a risk that future protests could result in clashes between protesters and pro-government supporters or in a government clampdown. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent president and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have continued to tighten their grip on power. The state of emergency law introduced after the failed coup has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to remain in place for the foreseeable future because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and to silence government critics. Almost 150,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk remains high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. We expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. Although there appear to be concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and his party has the ability to control the election process. Moreover, the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging the incumbent. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round, with just over 50% of the vote, against a joint candidate presented by the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties will consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the consti-tutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
There is a growing risk that the recent sharp deterioration in Turkey's relations with the EU and the US will lead to a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding concerns that under the leadership of Mr Erdogan and the AKP Turkey is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey immediately after the failed coup; the US's military backing of Syrian Kurdish groups, which Turkey regards as terrorist organisations with close ties with the PKK; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of Turkey's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably his push to become president with executive powers after the presidential and parliamentary elections due by late 2019.
We expect that Turkey and its Western allies will seek to avoid a complete breakdown in relations, which could materialise if, among other things, the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, Turkey closes the Incirlik airbase to US forces or it withdraws from NATO. However, if tensions remain at current levels for a prolonged period Turkey's strategic relationships with the EU and the US are likely to suffer irreparable damage and become increasingly antagonistic and transactional.
The spillover of violence from the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq will continue to pose serious domestic and external security threats to Turkey. In addition to terrorist attacks carried out in Turkey by IS and the PKK, which has camps in the mountains in northern Iraq, Turkey now has military forces deployed in two areas in Syria, ostensibly as part of the fight against IS but also to prevent US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds from establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey. The neighbouring conflicts are also likely to continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, and Russia has lifted almost all sanctions. The level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows to Turkey during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016 and early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy in November 2016 after a prolonged period of loosening. The lira has recovered the ground that it lost in January 2017, but it remains vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, as illustrated by short, sharp drops in value against the US dollar in July and October, probably prompted by expectations of balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region. If the lira depreciates sharply again, an abrupt tightening of policy, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery, may be necessary to halt the slide. However, this is not our baseline scenario, as we currently expect US monetary policy to be tightened only gradually in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit- and public debt-to-GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.2% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.4% in 2022. Although the government debt/GDP ratio edged up slightly, to 29.2% in 2016, we expect it to decline gradually, to about 27% in 2022. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates in order to revive economic activity has eased as the government has switched its attention to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility and expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance-sheet tapering. To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25% in late April, where it has remained. Since then the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has been about 12%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, owing in part to the disruption to the economy caused by the failed coup last July, but also to faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect growth to accelerate to 5.5% in 2017 and to average 4.4% in 2018-22. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. There are downside risks to this forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government in the next few years does not lead to further political instability, deterring foreign capital flows into the Turkish economy.
We expect a moderate improvement in household confidence, a recovery in employment growth and possible additional government incentives to support household spending. We forecast average real private consumption growth of 3.7% in 2017-22.
We expect government consumption growth to slow from an estimated 7% in 2017 to a still solid annual average of 6% per year in 2018-19 as the government continues to support the economy ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate, but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure projects, generating real growth of 6% per year in 2017-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a gradual deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-22. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourism sector. Our expectation is that a slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disin-flationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2021. There are upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Amid further bouts of volatility we estimate that the lira will depreciate against the US dollar in 2017, to an annual average of TL3.61:US$1, a fall of about 16% compared with 2016. From 2018 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL4.1:US$1 in 2022. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-22. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account deficit to widen moderately and remain large enough, at an average of 4.4% of GDP per year in 2017-22, to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in 2017, but the sector is likely to take several years to recover to its 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Country Forecast Peru September 2017

https://www.proquest.com/reports/country-forecast-peru-september-2017/docview/1962096540/se-2?accountid=14357

Abstract: According to official figures for the first semester of 2016, 84% of the urban population had access to potable water through the public network (a further 9% are served, but water is not deemed potable). According to the World Health Statistics 2017 report published by the WHO, which for Peru contains 2015 data, maternal mortality rates have more than halved over the past 15 years (from 160 to 68 per 100,000 births), but are still above the regional average of 52. [...]the current-account deficit will remain mostly stable, averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21. Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. [...]in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.

Full text: Peru--highlights: Political outlook
The president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former banker and experienced technocrat, is unlikely to make major changes during the remaining three years of his five-year term, which ends in July 2021. However, the president's small base of congressional support-his party holds just 17 of 130 seats-will complicate policymaking and hinder government effectiveness. In addition, a tepid economic recovery puts further pressure on the government. Institutions will remain weak and there are lingering security threats that need to be addressed, namely rising urban crime, drug-trafficking and the illicit activities of remnants of Sendero Luminoso (a terrorist group). Protests over controversial extractive projects could also affect political stability.
Peru--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2011 2016 2021
Total 27.3 29.4 31.6
 Male 14.9 15.7 16.7

Population growth   1.1 1.2
Working-age population growth   1.3 1.3
Labour force growth   1.0 1.3
The labour force will expand more quickly than the overall population in 2017-21, thereby contributing to a demographic bonus over the next two decades. The formal economy, despite having expanded relatively firmly in recent years, will struggle to absorb new entrants to the labour market. Consequently, the level of informal employment will remain high. Underdevelopment in rural areas will encourage the trend towards urbanisation, which stands at close to 80%. There should also be further improvements in education and health indicators, in line with lower levels of poverty (which has been more than halved since 2000). However, high levels of deprivation will persist in rural and indigenous communities.

Peru's business environment score rises in 2017-21, mostly owing to improvements in the regulatory environment and financing. Nonetheless, the country falls one position in The Economist Intelligence Unit's global ranking and remains in fifth place in the regional ranking. Peru's key strengths are its openness to foreign trade-secured by multiple free-trade agreements-and its prudent macroeconomic management. The business-friendly approach that existed during the historical period (2012-16) will remain in place under Mr Kuczynski, and is likely to be deepened and enhanced. Infrastructure will improve, although significant gaps will remain. Peru's labour market, albeit improving, will remain the weakest aspect of the business environment. Corruption and weak institutions will also prove a weakness.
Peru--highlights: Economic outlook

Exchange rate S:US$ (av) 3.4 3.3 3.3 3.4 3.4 3.4
GDP growth will average 3.4% in 2017-21, driven by a moderate recovery in investment. In the longer term, growth will hinge more on productivity improvements, as commodity prices will be lower than during the 2004-12 boom. Social and political pressure for higher public spending will persist, but the fiscal accounts will remain prudently managed and characterised by one of the lowest debt stocks in the region. The stable macroeconomic outlook will also be underpinned by low inflation and a manageable current-account deficit.
Peru--highlights: Market opportunities

GDP (US$ bn at market exchange rates) 195.3 215.2 225.4 236.5 248.6 266.5

Household consumption per head (US$) 4,040 4,410 4,570 4,740 4,950 5,230
Peru is a fairly small market and opportunities will remain restricted by low purchasing power measured in terms of GDP per head, as well as by high levels of poverty and inequality. That said, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class, notably in the capital, Lima. Rising demand from lower-income districts has led to a transformation in consumer patterns. Although progress will be gradual (constrained by still low disposable incomes among much of the population), we expect this trend to continue in 2017-21. Public investment in infrastructure will support greater integration of outlying regions.
Peru--highlights: Long-term outlook

Growth of real GDP per head 2.7 2.5 2.6
Growth of real GDP 3.8 3.1 3.4
Labour productivity growth 2.4 2.4 2.4
Growth in Peru's real GDP per head is forecast to slow from an annual average of 2.7% in 2017-30 to 2.5% in 2031-50. The weak institutional environment and widespread income and regional inequalities will continue to hold back stronger growth. The demographic bonus will have run its course by the mid-2030s, weighing on total GDP growth. At the same time, education levels will remain low, with only marginal progress forecast. Low inflation and a stable currency will contribute to macroeconomic stability. Abundant opportunities in energy, mining and infrastructure will continue to attract investment. Nevertheless, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and the prices of commodities.

Background: More than 12 years of military rule ended in 1980. Following a decade of economic and social instability, the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) ended hyperinflation, advanced reforms to liberalise the economy and defeated the Maoist Sendero Luminoso insurgency. However, Mr Fujimori subverted Peru's democratic institutions and committed grave human rights abuses. His government collapsed over a corruption scandal. The subsequent governments have been successful in consolidating macroeconomic stability, but have largely overlooked the structural reforms required to raise productivity levels. The current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, took office in July 2016. His term runs to July 2021.
Political structure: The 1993 constitution established a presidential regime with a powerful executive, elected for five years. Consecutive presidential re-election is not permitted. A 130-member unicameral legislature, elected at the same time as the president, also sits for five years. The government is decentralising revenue and responsibility to the 25 regions (including the constitutional province of Callao).
Policy issues: The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that there will be continuity of orthodox economic policies and that the business environment will remain attractive. Mr Kuczynski is a former World Bank economist and mining minister, and we expect gradual progress on structural reform under his government. The public education and healthcare systems will continue to underperform, despite increases in funding. The government will also increase spending on social programmes to reduce poverty levels. Despite government involvement in the market, private investment in transport, energy and water infrastructure will remain strong. Bilateral free-trade agreements with Peru's main trading partners-including the US, China and the EU-as well as initiatives within Latin America, will help to keep investment and trade flows strong in 2017-21.
Taxation: The corporate income-tax rate is 29.5% (mining companies that do not benefit from tax-stability contracts pay additional taxes). Dividends and other profit distribution schemes are taxed at 5%. Branch-profit tax is levied at 30% and remittance tax at 10%.Interest paid abroad stands at 5%.
Foreign trade: Tariffs are levied on imports at either 0%, 6% or 11%. The World Bank's calculation of the average effective tariff was 1.4% in 2014. Most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated. In 2016 merchandise export earnings increased by 8%, to US$37bn, whereas the import bill declined by 6%, to US$35.1bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, of the centre-right Peruanos por el Kambio (PPK), started the second year of a five-year term in July. Although PPK is the second largest bloc in Congress, it holds just 17 of the 130 seats in the legis-lature. PPK has so far had trouble advancing Mr Kuczynksi's legislative agenda, as it has often been obstructed by the right-wing Fuerza Popular (FP), which holds an outright congressional majority, with 71 seats. FP is led by Keiko Fujimori, who lost a bitterly contested presidential run-off election to Mr Kuczynski in June 2016 by a margin of 41,000 votes (17m valid votes were cast). Although hostilities have eased following a July 2017 meeting between Mr Kuczynski and Ms Fujimori, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects relations to remain fraught. The meeting with Ms Fujimori was followed by similar meetings with the other parties represented in Congress, including the left-wing Frente Amplio (FA), which holds ten seats, the centrist Alianza para el Progreso (nine seats), the centre-right Acción Popular (five seats) and the centre-left Partido Aprista Peruano (five seats). The latter has regularly voted with FP, whereas the FA and the others have been less co-operative. In the past, congress-sional blocs in Peru's congress have often fragmented, and 13 lawmakers have already left their original blocs since the start of Mr Kuczynski's term. They are currently unaffiliated, as they are banned from forming new blocs or joining existing ones due to an August 2016 law pushed through by FP. Of the 13, ten are former members of the FA (which split in July), two originate from the FP bloc and one was a PPK member. The 2016 law has been legally challenged, and we expect the Constitutional Court to declare it unconstitutional.

Political outlook: Political stability
The president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio (PPK), has now entered the second of his five-year term (ending July 2021) and will continue to face a challenging political environment, as his party holds just 17 seats in the 130-seat unicameral Congress. He will need to negotiate with the opposition to pass legislation-in particular, the right-wing Fuerza Popular (FP), which holds a majority, with 71 seats. FP has not hesitated to flex its legislative muscles, taking advantage of the Peruvian legislature's power to force ministerial resignations with a simple majority of 66 votes. FP has now thrice ejected ministers, with the last ousting coming in June. FP's leader, Keiko Fujimori, has faced some internal criticism for her hard opposition, but has maintained party discipline, in part thanks to meeting with Mr Kuczynski in mid-July. Since then, tension has eased and, as a show of good faith, FP confirmed the government's candidate for the post of comptroller-general. On July 27th Congress voted on its leadership positions for the 2017-18 term, with an FP congressman, Luis Galarreta, appointed speaker. Mr Galarreta has been a harsh critic of Mr Kuczynski, but has promised to put partisanship aside amid ongoing negotiations with the newly-appointed economy minister, Fernando Zavala, to boost public and private investment in the economy. Independent of short-term relations, we expect FP's opposition to seriously hamper Mr Kuczynski's ability to carry out policy initiatives.
When ousting Mr Kuczynski's three ministers, FP legislators cited potential (currently unsubstantiated) acts of corruption. Investigations into malfeasance have paralysed progress on large public works projects and landed prominent politicians, including the former president, Ollanta Humala (2011-16), in prison. On August 4th Mr Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia lost an appeal that would have led to their release from pre-trial detention. The couple continue to deny accusations of criminal misconduct. Corruption will continue to be a key issue, as opinion polls show widespread popular anger over graft. Despite FP's best efforts to stay clear of perceptions of corruption, party members are at risk of being implicated in the Odebrecht money-laundering and bribery scandal. In late August prosecutors confirmed that they were investigating Ms Fujimori and her links to alleged money laundering operations. Ms Fujimori denies any wrongdoing, but she risks losing popularity and siling the party's image.
Social conflict resulting from impoverished rural and indigenous communities' opposition to extractive projects poses an ongoing latent risk, given economic dependence on mining. Weak institutions will allow corruption and mismanagement to endure, especially at the local level. Police corruption and institutional weaknesses in the legal system will obstruct progress, as will the illicit drugs trade (Peru is a major coca producer).
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Mr Kuczynski's government will continue to adhere to the market-friendly policies that have guided Peru since 1990. The Kuczynski administration's stated goal is to promote policies to boost economic growth by unlocking investments-particularly in infrastructure-broadening the tax base, and improving the quality and scope of public services.
Given Peru's constitutionally weak presidency and the fact that Mr Kuczynski's modernising and infrastructure upgrade agenda require congressional approval, the government's relationship with Congress is crucial for success. So far, governability has been weak owing to fraught relations with the FP. Opposition lawmakers have triggered the resignation of three Cabinet ministers by taking advantage of the Peruvian legislature's power to force ministerial resignations with a simple majority of 66 votes. Under the constitution, Mr Kuczynski can counter such a vote against a single minister by demanding a vote of confidence in his full cabinet. Two failed votes of confidence in his cabinet trigger the dissolution of Congress and "snap" legislative elections. Mr Kuczynski threatened to take this route during the removal process of all three of his ousted ministers, but FP did not flinch and the president backed down. Given Mr Kuczynski's similarly low popularity ratings in comparison to the opposition and his party's low presence in many regions of the country, it is unlikely that he would increase his parliamentary representation if an election were held. As such, the threat of forcing "snap" legislative elections is not a credible one from Mr Kuczynski. The possibility of a game of brinkmanship going awry, however, cannot be discounted. Regardless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects relations to remain fraught, impeding government effectiveness.
Despite its poor relations with Congress, the administration was able to secure congressional approval for special powers to rule by decree between September 2016 and January 2017. It produced 112 decrees across five broad areas-administrative reform, anti-corruption, public security, economic reform, and water and sanitation measures. FP has so far also been co-operative on recon-struction plans in the wake of flooding that devastated infrastructure across the country in the first quarter of 2017. The reconstruction effort is expected to cost US$6.2bn between 2018 and 2021. In August Congress approved a loosening on the fiscal rule, allowing the government to widen the non-financial public deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2018 (albeit before narrowing it gradually back to 1% by 2021). Nonetheless, Mr Kuczynski's ambitious infra-structure plans must be approved by an obstructive legislature. Indeed, two of the ejected ministers were dismissed owing to a now-scrapped infrastructure project.
Given congressional resistance, Mr Kuczynski will fare better when re-organising the executive's own internal bureaucratic processes. So far, the presi-dent has re-structured procedures at a variety of government offices. Crucially, and in a bid to meet its infrastructure investment pledges, the administration streamlined approval procedures, replacing the Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública, the national public investment system, with a new body, Invierte.pe (capital expenditure and budget execution rates for public works have since remained sluggish). Despite these reforms, government effectiveness will continue to be hampered by longstanding institutional problems, chiefly the ineffectiveness of bureaucracy, especially at the sub-national level. To address this, the Kuczynski administration has moved to strengthen the decentralisation process, instituting quarterly meetings with the Asamblea Nacional de Gobiernos Regionales, which brings together the country's 25 governors, and the Asociación de Municipalidades del Perú, which unites more than 1,800 mayors.
The administration's efforts to empower regional governments have been hampered by the high level of corruption at the sub-national levels. Four sitting governors were arrested on corruption charges in the 18 months ending in September 2017, with two now in prison, and two released and allowed to retake office. Six former governors were in prison as at September 2017. Corruption has also hampered national government effectiveness, with the case surrounding Odebrecht, a Brazilian firm that admitted to bribery in Peru during 2004-15. The immediate result was the cancellation of a US$5bn gas pipeline project, but the scandal's breadth and unpredictability heightens political uncertainty, as there is a risk that members of both the opposition and the government will be implicated. So far, the investigation has resulted in an arrest warrant against a former president, Alejandro Toledo (2001-06), and the arrest of another former president, Ollanta Humala (2011-16), and his wife, Nadine Herrera. Mr Toledo, for whom Mr Kuczynski served as both economy minister (2004-05) and prime minister (2005-06), remains a fugitive in the US. Mr Humala and Ms Heredia are in pre-trial detention. The judiciary has also initiated investigations against another former president, Alan García (1985-90, 2006-11) and the FP leader, Keiko Fujimori. Messrs Toledo, García and Humala deny all charges, as do Mses Herrera and Fujimori.
Corruption continues to be a serious problem in many government agencies. Using his special legislative powers in 2016, Mr Kuczynski approved nine legis-lative decrees on corruption, which mandate restructuring the system governing ad-hoc prosecutors, implementing a whistle-blower law to protect people who denounce corruption, strengthening data-protection laws, and creating a registry of attorneys sentenced or fined for violations. However, the judiciary will remain slow, opaque, underfunded and riddled with a culture of bribery and political manipulation. The Kuczynski administration proposed legislation in July 2017 to restructure the Consejo Nacional de la Magistatura, which selects and evaluates judges and prosecutors, but the bill met with strong opposition from the judiciary and a judicial reform is unlikely in the coming months. Although high-level cases are usually successfully prosecuted, there is nevertheless a high degree of tolerance of corruption by the political establishment as a whole, as well as close links between politicians and special interest groups.
Political outlook: Election watch
Presidential and congressional elections, held every five years, last took place in mid-2016. The next elections are municipal and regional polls in October 2018; presidential and legislative elections will next be held in mid-2021; Mr Kuczynski will not be in the running for the presidency, as consecutive re-election is prohibited. Congress is currently in the process of discussing bills on electoral reform. There is broad consensus among legislators regarding the need for changes to electoral rules, but agreements are currently far off. Peru currently lacks a formal nationwide party structure, and local-level parties tend to have little affiliation with national parties, leading to disassociation between the results of local and national elections. The elections in 2021 are likely to see Ms Fujimori as the presidential candidate for FP, despite increasingly clear ambitions for party leadership on the part of her brother, Kenji. Verónika Mendoza of the left-wing Nuevo Perú (formerly of the left-wing Frente Amplio coalition), who came third in the first round of the presidential race in 2016, will also feature. However, the lack of party structures facilitates the rapid ascent of personalities and political outsiders.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Pedro Pablo Kuczynski
The president, Mr Kuczynski, scored a narrow victory over a former congresswoman, Keiko Fujimori, in the 2016 election, winning by a margin of around 41,000 votes. Mr Kuczynski, is a former banker and experienced technocrat who served as minister of economy and finance, and as cabinet chief, during the term of a former president, Alejandro Toledo (2001-06). He also held the post of minister for energy and mines in the 1980s, before spending decades in the private sector. Mr Kuczynski's first year in office was plagued by problems, including a rocky relationship with congress and massive flooding during the first quarter of 2017. He started his government with an approval rating of around 60% and finished his first year in office at around 30%.
Keiko Fujimori
Ms Fujimori narrowly lost to Mr Kuczynski in the June 2016 presidential election, her second defeat in a presidential contest (she lost to Ollanta Humala in 2011). This loss was partly due to a concerted effort by Ms Fujimori's opponents to keep her from office, stemming from fears that her government would mark a return to the excesses of the regime of her father, a former president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), who is currently serving a 25-year sentence (from 2009) for human rights violations and corruption. Ms Fujimori has consolidated her political party, Fuerza Popular (FP), as the principal opposition. She has faced some internal dissidence in FP owing to her insistence on party discipline and her strong opposition to Mr Kuczynski, but remains the undisputed leader of FP. Ms Fujimori will continue to command significant power to guide policy in Peru, despite her election loss. She is likely to stage a third bid for the presidency in 2021.
Kenji Fujimori
The younger brother of Keiko Fujimori, Mr Fujimori is currently in his second term in Congress. A popular figure, he received a record number of votes in the 2011 and 2016 congressional elections. Mr Fujimori has emerged as a de facto leader of the internal opposition to Ms Fujimori within FP. He has often clashed with FP's congressional leaders regarding the party's militant opposition to Mr Kuczynski. His sister has so far re-asserted control (she suspended him from the FP congressional caucus for 60 days in July 2017). However, Mr Fujimori has received the support of Alberto Fujimori and matched his sister's approval ratings in August 2017. He will remain a key figure in Peruvian politics.
Luis Galarreta
Mr Galarreta, serving his third five-year term in Congress representing the capital, Lima, was elected speaker of Congress for the 2017-2018 legislative year. Although in his third term as congressman, Mr Galarreta is new to the FP caucus. He was elected on an FP ticket in 2016, but first came to Congress in 2006 on a coalition ticket. He was re-elected in 2011 as part of a coalition led by Mr Kuczynski. This political past helps cast Mr Galarreta as a better consensus-builder than his predecessor, an FP congresswoman, Luz Salgado. Mr Galarreta has pledged to work with the administration to find common ground to avoid legislative gridlock.
Verónika Mendoza
Ms Mendoza came third in the 2016 presidential race as head of the left-wing Frente Amplio (FA). She received 19% of the vote and the FA secured 20 seats in Congress, making it the second largest bloc. However, the FA proved incapable of remaining united in Congress, and split in two in July 2017. Ten lawmakers followed Ms Mendoza into a new party, Nuevo Perú, while ten remained in the FA under the leadership of Marco Arana, a congressman who represents the region of Cajamarca. Ms Mendoza and Mr Arana are bitter rivals, despite the fact that he ran as her vice presidential candidate. Ms Mendoza's relevance going forward will hinge on Nuevo Perú securing the signatures required-approximately 750,000-to officially register and be able to field candidates in the 2018 subnational and 2021 national elections.
Political outlook: International relations
Peru will continue to support regional integration efforts, such as the Pacific Alliance, an economic integration pact that also includes Colombia, Chile and Mexico, and others implemented under the Union of South American Nations (Unasur). Members of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended in 2016) have stated a desire for greater integration with the Pacific Alliance, but we do not currently forecast any progress in 2017-21.
In May Peru and another ten of the 12 signatories of the Trans-Pacific Partnership announced their intention to move ahead despite the US's exit from the trade pact, but short-term progress is unlikely. Instead, bilateral agree-ments will become the focus of Peruvian trade policy. Peru currently has 16 trade deals in place, covering nearly all of the world's largest economies, including Canada, China, the EU, Japan, South Korea and the US. The government is now in advanced talks with India and Australia. A deal with Australia may come through the Pacific Alliance, as the members have announced that trade talks will begin with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore in September as part of those countries' accession to the group as associate members (of the four, Peru lacks a bilateral free-trade agreement with only Australia).

Working-age population will outstrip overall population growth
Population growth slowed to 1.1% a year in 2012-16, down from 2.2% in the 1980s and 2% in the 1990s, owing to migration abroad and a declining birth rate. Growth will pick-up slightly in 2017-21, to 1.2%, and will remain above the global average, reflecting high birth rates among lower income households and advances in healthcare (reflected in outcomes including lower infant mortality). The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries. A modest rise in the old-age dependency ratio-the proportion of the population above working age-will be more than offset by a decline in the young-age dependency ratio in the medium term. The number of people of working age will therefore continue to rise faster than the growth of the population as a whole, providing a demographic bonus to the economy.
As with many Latin American countries, Peru has experienced rapid urban-isation in recent decades. In 2015, according to the latest data estimation available from the national statistics institute, 77% of the total population lived in cities, with 80% of those living in Lima, the capital. Urbanisation will continue to rise during the forecast period as Peruvians seek better living and employment conditions. Informal employment, which is estimated to account for over 70% of the economically active population, will remain high, notably in the construction and retail sectors. Informal unemployment is expected to decline only gradually, helped by government efforts to ease labour costs for businesses via tax simplification and subsidies, but will remain high by international standards. The unemployment rate reached a record low of 6% in 2013, but has been slowly creeping up since then as the economy has cooled. The level reached 7% in the May-July 2017 rolling quarter. Although still relatively low, this masks high levels of underemployment, which affects as much as 35% of those employed, and is tied to a mismatch between labour market demands and the focus and quality of education.
Demographic indicators to improve but from a low base
Although Peru's demographic indicators will make progress in the next decade-as education standards rise, nutrition improves, and access to safe water and sanitation is expanded-they will remain relatively poor. Poverty levels have declined significantly in the past decade. The proportion of the population living in poverty fell from around 55% in 2000 to 20.7% in 2016. However, there are marked regional disparities, with 44% of the population in rural areas still living below the poverty line in 2016 (down from 74% in 2007). According to official figures for the first semester of 2016, 84% of the urban population had access to potable water through the public network (a further 9% are served, but water is not deemed potable). Meanwhile, only 61% of the rural population is reached by the public network, and only 15% of those served receive potable water. The extension of the water and sanitation network will remain one of the highest public healthcare priorities and will continue to receive substantial investment in the forecast period, as the government has planned large expenses in 2018-21.
Health status indicators have improved significantly in recent decades, although regional variations in infant and maternal mortality rates are pronounced. Average life expectancy at birth has risen to 75.5 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO); its figures differ from the local-source data on which The Economist Intelligence Unit's current forecasts are based. According to the World Health Statistics 2017 report published by the WHO, which for Peru contains 2015 data, maternal mortality rates have more than halved over the past 15 years (from 160 to 68 per 100,000 births), but are still above the regional average of 52. The mortality rate of children under five has been on a declining trend, reaching 16.9 per 1,000 births in 2015 (down from 40 in 2000), although it remains a serious problem, especially in the more remote rural districts. Latest cause-of-death data (2014) show malignant tumours are the single highest cause of mortality, followed by influenza and pneumonia. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes also rank high amongst the main sources of mortality. Our projections assume that there will be some progress in health statistics in 2017-21 but that Peru will continue to lag behind most other countries in the region.

Peru's business environment rankings remain broadly stable for the 2017-21 forecast period: the country falls to 51st place globally (from 50th in 2012-16), despite a slight increase in score, and remains in fifth place regionally. Peru's ranking will be constrained by limited market opportunities, which will worsen owing to slower economic growth, and by its labour market score, which, despite some improvement, remains low. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline scenario assumes that the president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who started the second of his five years in office in July 2017, will continue with orthodox macroeconomic policies and prudent fiscal management during his five-year term. There will be no significant changes to the existing business-friendly approach, but a weak global climate for Peru's principal exports, coupled with persistent difficulties in reducing bureaucracy and corruption, mean that the country slips in the global rankings.
Peru will be open to trade and will have a stable macroeconomic outlook
Peru's key strengths in the forecast period will be its stable macroeconomic environment and openness towards foreign trade and investment, secured by free-trade agreements (FTAs) with most of the world's major economies. Regionally, Peru is part of the Pacific Alliance, an economic integration pact that also includes Colombia, Chile and Mexico. As of May 2016, 92% of the goods traded between the Pacific Alliance countries are tariff-free (100% of goods will be tariff-free by 2033). Peru was also part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, and has remained in the so-called TPP11 grouping following the US's withdrawal. Economic growth in 2017-21, although not reaching the levels of 2006-2011, will still be solid, averaging 3.4% annually, and above the Latin American average. We anticipate that the Kuczynski administration will upgrade Peru's infrastructure as a result of rising public spending and investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs). However, significant gaps will persist, owing to weak project execution by the public sector, preventing a more substantial rise in Peru's infrastructure ranking. Peru's rigid labour market and weak institutions are expected to remain the weakest aspects of the business environment in the outlook period.
Business environment outlook: Peru's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Reforms to reduce some taxes and streamline bureaucracy are introduced by the government.
2019-21: Government to allow increased private participation in state-run firms, including electricity and water utilities. Policies to induce formalisation in small and medium-sized enterprises expected.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Changes to regulations in order to stimulate foreign investment in value-added mining projects and infrastructure.
2019-21: Foreign investment in infrastructure strengthens, primarily in transportation and telecommunications. Investment picks up in mining, although on a smaller scale than in the past.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Consolidation of the Pacific Alliance, an integration project that also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico, boosts trade and investment flows.
2019-21: Free-trade agreements signed with Turkey, India and Australia. Companies benefit from conclusion of Trade in Services Agreement under negotiation by 52 countries.
Taxes
2017-18: Corporate income tax increased from 28% to 29.5% and taxes on dividends cut from 6.8% to 5%. Increasing use of "public works for taxes" schemes, allowing companies to invest part of their tax bill in transport and social infrastructure.
2019-21: Further tax breaks to boost labour market formality. Tax credits for large firms that reinvest profits.
Financing
2017-18: Merger with Colombian, Chilean and Mexican stockmarkets deepens capital markets, as does legislation from late 2015 exempting capital gains tax on the sale of shares until 2018 to increase stockmarket liquidity. Sovereign bonds can now be settled through Euroclear, a platform allowing easier access to international finance. Private firms will follow suit.
2019-21: Deeper penetration of the financial system as new mechanisms, such as an electronic money platform, take hold.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour rigidity remains a serious problem, despite government measures to reduce regulation.
2019-21: Government continues the use of tax incentives in an attempt to increase formality in the labour market to 60%, up from 27% in July 2017. Wages increase in key public sectors, including healthcare, the police force and schools.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The government's infrastructure plan starts to gain steam, with a focus on roadways and hydraulic structures. Broadband penetration increases. New thermal and hydroelectric plants provide sizeable power surplus, opening the way for electricity exports.
2019-21: Government ramps up investment to provide universal coverage of water and sewerage systems. Work launched on third and fourth lines of metro system in the capital, Lima. Gasoducto del Sur Peruano pipeline completed.

Macroeconomic environment will remain attractive to investors
Peru's macroeconomic environment will remain one of the most attractive features of the business environment in 2017-21, with the score increasing slightly. GDP expanded by 4% in 2016, but growth will slow to 2.5% in 2017 owing to natural disasters, depressed consumption and falling investment. We expect the economy to recover in 2018, expanding by 3.6%, supported by fiscal expansion, and recovering investment and private consumption.
Our baseline scenario continues to be that the institutional underpinnings of macroeconomic and fiscal policy will remain solid. The inflation rate was 3.2% in August, slightly above the target range of 1-3% set by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank) for the year. However, the result was influenced by the flooding that struck the country at the start of the year, and we expect end-2017 inflation to fall into the target range. We expect inflation to average 2.7% in 2018-21, assuming moderate demand pressures and a gentle rate of nominal currency depreciation. The Kuczynski administration will maintain a prudent fiscal policy. The government recently announced that it has widened its 2018 target for the non-financial public-sector deficit to 3.5% of GDP, to accommodate its ambitious infrastructure plans. The administration foresees deficits narrowing to 1% of GDP by 2021. We do not expect such an improve-ment, but do expect a narrowing of the deficit to 1.4% of GDP by 2021. Although the government will take advantage of the low public debt/GDP ratio (24% in 2016) to pursue debt-fuelled spending, we do not expect the debt/GDP ratio to exceed 30% in 2017-21.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves during the outlook period, although Peru's ranking falls both at the global and regional level, as conditions will improve more rapidly in other countries. Legislation approved in December 2016 strengthened the Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y de la Protección de la Propiedad Intelectual (Indecopi), which oversees issues relating to competition and intellectual property rights, although new laws were approved to enhance the state's capacity to expropriate land required for public works. Additional legislation to enhance expropriation powers was submitted by July, but had not been debated in Congress by September. However, Mr Kuczynski's regulatory overhaul will have to contend with an obstructionist Congress in which the government only holds 17 of 130 seats. This raises the risk that the government will water down proposed reforms-or withdraw them entirely.
Government looks to re-organise state-run companies and open private partnerships
The Kuczynski administration has not modified the approach to public companies adopted by the previous three administrations. It does not plan on allowing private participation in emblematic state-owned firms, including Petróleos del Perú (Petroperú, the state oil company) or the Servicio de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Lima, which provides water and sanitation to residents of the capital city. However, the administration, did make some key decisions regarding Petroperú: in January 2017 it published legislation related to the corporate reorganisation of the company and approved a debt strategy for the US$5.4bn modernisation of the company's flagship refinery, Talara, on the northern coast. As part of this, in May the company placed US$2bn in bonds. Although not considering privatisation of assets, the administration announced the possibility of bringing in a private partner for management of the 1,100-km northern oil pipeline, which is operated by Petroperú but was closed in February 2016 for repairs. The pipeline remains closed as at September 2017.
The government has also taken action on the two upstream blocks in which Petroperú is involved. In November 2016 the administration published a decree formalising an agreement in which Argentina-based GeoPark took a 75% stake in Block 64 in the northern jungle. Production of approximately 7,000 barrels/day of light crude is scheduled to begin in 2019. In April 2017 Petroperú began negotiations on an agreement with Canada's Frontera Energy regarding Block 192 in the northern jungle. Frontera was awarded a temporary concession in August 2015 to operate the block, but this will expire in August 2018, at which point responsibility for the block will revert to Petroperú. However, Petroperú will seek a similar agreement to that reached with GeoPark before then.
The state continues to implement reforms to increase competition and improve the business environment. It approved 16 legislative decrees for bureaucratic simplification in the final quarter of 2016. In addition to overhauling Indecopi in December 2016, the administration improved legislation for consumer defence and protection, and implemented changes to regulations related to obtaining an operating license. It currently takes 26 days to start a business, according to the World Bank's Doing Business 2017 report.

Peru will retain its support of foreign investment
Peru's score for policy towards foreign investment improves in 2017-21, and Peru climbs three positions in the global ranking, to 36th place. The country's regional ranking remains unchanged. The government will adhere to orthodox macroeconomic policies, and there is little risk of a change in its largely open policy and attitude towards foreign capital. Peru's investment-grade credit rating and the availability of investment-protection schemes (resulting from a wide array of FTAs) will sustain foreign investor confidence.
Major risks to foreign investment exist in both mining and the oil and gas sector, in which social and environmental concerns have paralysed a significant number of projects. To minimise social conflict around extractive projects legislation enacted in September 2011 created a framework for consulting indigenous communities before extractive and public-works projects take place. The process, known as consulta previa, means that indigenous communities must be consulted formally by the state instead of project sponsors, which had been the approach under the previous system. The Ministry of Culture oversees the organisation of the consultations, in co-ordination with the responsible sector. To better manage the socio-economic impact, Mr Kuczynski has unveiled a social development fund that will channel public funds towards providing basic services in areas where mining projects will be developed. In July the state Ombudsman's Office, which monitors conflicts, reported 55 active social conflicts involving mining projects and 11 involving oil and gas projects. The government calculates that social conflict and bureaucracy related to mining and energy projects are currently blocking expected foreign direct investment worth a total of around US$20bn. In July the state oil and gas promotion agency, Perupetro, reported that the country had 24 blocks under exploration (down from 36 a year earlier). Operations of seven of the 24 are stalled because of social protests, and a further five have been delayed by slow approval of environmental permits. Indeed, the government considers environmental rules too complex; in late 2016 it modified the rules regarding forestry concessions to facilitate investment, in addition to announcing changes at the government bureau in charge of reviewing environmental-impact assessments for all sectors, including mining and energy.
Administrative barriers around land use and expropriations have also meant delays in infrastructure works, which often rely on PPP schemes with foreign companies, owing to their complexity and size. The administration considers US$18bn in investment, including the US$6bn Line 2 of the Lima Metro and US$1.2bn second runaway at Lima's international airport, to be held-up by regulations regarding expropriation and land use. New rules for expropriations were approved in August 2015, guaranteeing the market value of the expropriated property and mandating an additional 10% to be paid on top of this sum, but delays continue. The administration proposed additional modifications in July, but Congress has yet to debate the bill related to these.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls falls in 2017-21 and Peru loses ground in the global and regional rankings. The reduced score is due to the county's relative underperformance (compared with countries of a similar size) in foreign trade as the country adapts to lower prices and reduced output growth of its mineral exports. Transactions on the current and capital accounts will remain free from restrictions, and the structural strength of the external position virtually eliminates the threat of exchange controls being imposed. The BCRP will continue to tweak reserve requirements on US dollar deposits and credit from abroad, as well as intervening actively in the currency markets, in order to manage liquidity and stem those financial foreign-exchange inflows that could easily be reversed. The currency has been fully convertible since 1990. Trade as a share of GDP has declined as export earnings have fallen in line with global commodity prices. Peru has a tripartite tariff structure, with 70.4% of items entering tariff-free, and the remaining items paying a tariff of either 6% (in the case of 20.8% of goods) or 11% (8.8% of goods).
Trade liberalisation will remain a priority in 2017-21
Trade liberalisation has been one of the pillars of Peru's economic strategy since implementation of a watershed FTA with the US in February 2009. The government implemented the Pacific Alliance's trade protocol in May 2016, making 92% of goods entering from Colombia, Chile and Mexico tariff-free (the remaining tariffs will be eliminated over a 17-year period). In addition, Peru has 15 FTAs in place, the most recent of which, with Honduras, was implemented this year. The government began bilateral trade negotiations with Australia in July and with India in August, and is scheduled to begin talks with Indonesia in November. The administration has held five rounds of negotiations with Turkey, but the process has been stalled since early 2016. Peru remains engaged in two of the world's largest potential agreements, including the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), which involves more than 50 World Trade Organisation members, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was signed in February 2016, but cast in doubt when the US pulled out in January 2017. Despite protectionist rhetoric from the US, we do not expect Peru to be targeted by potential US protectionist measures The remaining 11 countries that signed the TPP held their first meeting in Japan in July to look for pathways forward without US participation.
There is only a low risk that the government will introduce non-tariff trade barriers during the forecast period, although regulatory issues could come into play. Indecopi currently has 11 anti-dumping measures in place, including five on products from China, two each on products from Argentina and the US, and one each on products from India and Pakistan. Concerns remain about legislation prohibiting imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for ten years, starting in 2013. In July 2016 the government began to publish lists of GMOs that were not allowed into Peru. There have also been objections to legislation requiring labelling on packaged snack food, which came into force in May. In July Mr Kuczynski vetoed legislation that would have prohibited the use of powdered milk in finished dairy products.

Additional tax reforms could be in store
The score in this category improves slightly in the forecast period, and Peru improves its position in both the global and regional rankings. The Kuczynski administration changed tax legislation in December 2016, increasing the corporate income rate to 29.5% and rolling back a law approved by the previous administration in 2015 that progressively lowered the rate, which was scheduled to fall to 27% in 2017 and to 26% in 2019. The government also set the tax on dividend payments at 5% (down from 6.5%) and in January 2017 announced that it would lower the value-added tax (VAT) rate by 1 percentage point, to 17%, as of July 1st. That reduction was contingent upon VAT collections reaching 7.2% of GDP by May, which did not happen. The administration hopes to implement the reduction in 2018. A 5% capital gains tax has been suspended until end-2019, when it will come under review.
The government plans to widen the tax base by providing incentives to companies, simplifying payment procedures and cracking down on tax evasion. To this end, in December 2016 it created new and lower tax brackets for small and medium-sized companies, in addition to providing relief on back taxes. Tax revenue was 14% of GDP in 2016, down from 15.2% the previous year. In nominal terms, tax collection was down by 2.3% year on year in January-July 2017.

Prudential indicators show that the banking sector remains solid
The score in this category improves slightly in 2017-21, owing to an improvement in the availability of medium-term financing. Despite this, Peru falls two positions in the global ranking and remains in fourth spot regionally. The sector's balance sheet is strong-the overall non-performing loan ratio has remained relatively stable in recent years, at between 1.5% and 3%. The capital adequacy ratio is well above the legal minimum, and liquidity levels are adequate. Capital markets are shallow but growing, and Peruvian companies with solid credit ratings will continue to have ample access to long-term finance through a multitude of channels such as stock issues, bonds and bank loans. Obtaining foreign financing will be easier in the future, as a recent sovereign bond issuance was made available to foreign investors through Euroclear, a clearing house designed to improve access and security for investors. The government and financial authorities have stated that they expect the scheme will be used by private firms in the future.
The national roll-out in 2016 of a new single electronic money platform, which involves all financial institutions and telecommunications providers, should increase the penetration of the banking system, incorporating new clients into the system and encouraging banks to offer new financial products for small and medium-sized enterprises where financial inclusion is lowest.
Further progress expected on stockmarket integration
The Bolsa de Valores de Lima (the Lima stock exchange) will continue its integration into the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (the Latin American Integrated Market)-a joint initiative of the bourses of Peru, Colombia, Chile and Mexico-to become a single unified equity and securities exchange. Regulatory issues (such as harmonising tax rules) mean that integration is expected to proceed slowly, but it will deepen Peru's shallow capital markets.
Large domestic corporations currently enjoy captive demand for their securities from three main institutional investors: the Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs, private pension funds), insurance companies and mutual funds. Deeper capital markets would boost retail trading, introducing some dynamism. Issuance will continue to grow in the forecast period to include mid-sized companies-allowing equity finance to become a source of capital for a wider range of companies than the present limited group of blue-chip businesses-but a weak corporate governance culture and concerns over public information disclosure will remain the main restriction to issuance of shares.

The labour market will remain an area of weakness, weighing on Peru's score
Although Peru's labour market will remain one of the weakest aspects of the business environment, the score increases in 2017-21, lifting the country in the global rankings (Peru's regional ranking remains unchanged). The rigidity of Peru's labour regime hampers job creation, and the low quality of education has resulted in a low-skilled labour force with poor productivity. As at July 2017 73% of the economically active population works in the informal sector, and only a minority of workers have access to health insurance or pensions, or pay taxes. Regional differences in employment quality-particularly its adequacy in terms of hours worked and remuneration-and productivity levels are stark. Poor areas register extremely low levels of productivity and are dominated by subsistence farming. Income inequality is high; the monthly minimum wage has been set at S850 (US$261) since May 1st 2016, and the government has not intimated any plans of a planned increase.
The Kuczynski administration did not attempt labour reforms in its first year in office, and is unlikely to present sweeping reforms. It has limited its attempts at encouraging formal employment to tax incentives for small companies and subsidies for youth employment. In terms of labour standards, the administration did submit legislation to Congress in July 2017 to increase the scope of labour inspections. In addition, lawmakers presented, but Congress did not debate, 20 separate bills on labour issues in the first seven months of 2017.

Infrastructure set to improve but large gaps will remain
The score for infrastructure improves in 2017-21, reflecting increased public and public-private investment. In addition to increased private investment in telecoms (an important recipient of foreign investment), the improvement is attributable to a series of fiscal stimulus packages that have been implemented since 2009, as well as increased budgeted expenditure and an ambitious programme of PPPs that the government envisages will exceed US$25bn in 2017-21. This includes an estimated US$6.2bn that will be used to repair and reorganise infrastructure destroyed during vast flooding in the first quarter of 2017. Another important move is the decision to strengthen and broaden a "public works for taxes" scheme that allows private companies to invest part of their tax payments in infrastructure. Originally designed for transport infrastructure, it has been expanded to cover schools, clinics, water and sanitation, and security infrastructure. The programme has involved the approval of 295 projects since 2009, including 55 in the first seven months of 2017. Nevertheless, infrastructure will remain a weak aspect of Peru's business environment.
Major infrastructure works have started slowly but are under construction
Major infrastructure projects, such as construction of the US$6bn second line of the Lima Metro, a US$5.4bn modernisation of the state-owned Talara oil refinery, and the US$1.2bn construction of a second runway at Lima's international airport are under construction, but behind schedule. The state has postponed tenders on several major projects, including the third and fourth lines of the Lima Metro, which the Kuczynski government has pledged to jump-start. The government has also promised construction of a commuter rail line that would connect Lima with nearby cities to the north and south.
The contracts for two major projects, the US$7.3bn construction and 30-year management contract for a natural gas pipeline, and the US$560m construction of a new airport in the Cusco region, were cancelled in 2017. The first was scrapped because of a corruption scandal involving the concession-holder, Odebrecht (a Brazilian construction firm at the centre of corruption cases across the region), and the second because of objections in Congress to a change in the contract. Regardless of the issues of corruption, the design and execution of infrastructure concessions has traditionally been poor, reflecting low technical capacity in the public sector and persistent corruption surrounding public projects. Flaws in the design of contracts mean that public projects struggle to raise finance and need several amendments before they can go ahead, causing severe delays that have deterred some international participants. Successful bidders should act strategically to navigate the public sector's restrictions.
Peru's telecoms and technology infrastructure has grown and modernised-largely as a result of foreign investment. Increased competition in the mobile telephony market and the introduction of new technologies will result in a fall in costs for consumers in the forecast period. A new fibre-optic network was completed in the third quarter of 2016, allowing broadband service to reach 180 provincial capitals. In May 2016 the government awarded a 700-MHz band, allowing for high-speed broadband service in high-density areas in Lima and other cities. Roll-out of the service continues.
Port infrastructure is expected to improve in 2017-21, and the cost of moving goods through the ports is set to decline. At present, Peru's ports are among the most expensive in the region. Major upgrades have been completed on the south pier at Callao (Peru's largest port), which is operated by Dubai-based DP World, and on the north pier, operated by Holland-based APM Terminals.
The construction of highway corridors in 2011 linking Peru to Brazil's highway network (known as the inter-oceanic highway) has improved Peru's road network and connections between the two countries' Atlantic and Pacific ports. We expect further projects to improve transport links between Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Peru will retain its prudent, business-friendly policy framework in 2017-21. Mr Kuczynski has cast himself as a technocratic reformer with a mandate to address a multitude of longstanding structural shortcomings, but progress will be limited. So far, he has focused on three areas: labour formalisation, administrative simplification and infrastructure investment. To achieve the first objective, the government has created new (and lower) tax brackets for small businesses, and changed regulations to make it easier to obtain business licences and register companies in decentralised government offices, which will also provide advisory services and training to businesses. In late July the government presented a bill to address labour informality and working conditions; the outcome will depend on support from FP.
In terms of more dynamic public procedures and administration, Mr Kuczynski has restructured or overhauled procedures at a variety of government entities. These include the tax authority, the state-owned petroleum company, the state investment-promotion agency and government bureaux that administer public investment. The administration hopes that a more streamlined government will not only entice private investment, but also facilitate an ambitious infra-structure programme (of which a sizable share consists of public-private partnerships). The latter is a key concern, as the administration has pinned its hopes for dynamic GDP expansion on infrastructure investment. However, capital expenditure and budget execution rates for public works remain low (by August 24th only 31.7% of the budgeted investment for 2017 had been carried out), and the legislature has proven a significant obstacle to infrastructure plans. Congress has not only impeded projects, but has also ejected the ministers of transport and finance, who between them headed the infrastructure efforts.
The government will remain committed to attempting reforms in 2017-21, including major changes to the pension system, and to education and security policy. We are not optimistic about the government's chance of success. Polls indicate that Mr Kuczynski's popularity has reached a new low with a job approval rating of less than 30%. He has also faced much criticism for his mismanagement of ongoing strikes by public-sector employees. As the president's party has surrendered most of its political leverage, FP has free reign to determine the legislative agenda. It may well support some reforms that are aligned with its own platform, but it has shown a tendency to resist some measures, even those that may be ideologically in line with its own platform, for political gain.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators

  2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
Government expenditure 29.4 30.4 31.3 30.5 30.0 29.5
Government revenue 26.8 27.7 28.0 28.0 28.1 28.1
Budget balance -2.6 -2.7 -3.3 -2.5 -1.9 -1.4
Government debt 23.8 25.7 28.0 29.1 29.6 29.3
The non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit is forecast to widen to 2.7% of GDP in 2017 and to 3.3% of GDP in 2018, before recurrent expenditure restraint and increased tax collection help to narrow it to 1.4% by 2021. In terms of outlays, capital expenses will be the government's primary focus. In early May the government presented Congress with a US$7.1bn (3.6% of 2016 GDP) public investment package for 2017-20 to both boost economic growth and address infrastructure shortcomings that were made evident during floods in February-March this year. Despite the expected negotiations in Congress, the plan will be approved. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is slated to present eight bills to Congress in September to catalyse the economic recovery. Mr Zavala has also sought to increase budgetary flexibility so that reallocation of funds does not have to go through Congress each time; however, we don't think he will prevail.

The government's capacity to implement all the infrastructure measures is in doubt, given its past performance; hence, our forecast does not foresee complete compliance. Furthermore, the infrastructure plan will raise outlays, and push capital and overall expenditure respectively to highs of 8.5% of GDP and 31.3% of GDP in 2018. As for revenue, we expect improved tax collection in 2017-21. This is due in part to reforms at the tax authority and changes to tax legislation introduced in January 2017, which included an increase in corporate income tax to 29% and attempts to broaden the tax base. These changes will result in higher receipts in GDP terms in the forecast period. In 2017-18 these will only partly offset the rise in spending, but will result in deficit reductions in 2019-21, when we expect public expenditure to be reined in.

We forecast that the public debt/GDP ratio will reach 25.7% of GDP in 2017 and average 29.5% of GDP in 2020-21. Nonetheless, this level will be low by regional and global standards. Peru will retain good access to voluntary financing from domestic and international markets and, in the event that external conditions deteriorate sharply (not our baseline scenario), the country would be able to access multilateral funding with relative ease.
Given sluggish economic activity and ebbing core inflation, the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank) has both the opportunity and cause for monetary easing. On July 13th the BCRP cut its rate policy rate for the second time this year, bringing it to 3.75%, but kept the rate unchanged at its mid-August meeting. In line with our baseline expectation of continued low growth and easing inflation, we expect a further cut in 2017, to 3.5%. In 2018-19 the bank will be wary of pursuing overly expansionary policy in the context of rising interest rates in the US. A loosening of monetary policy in the US in 2020 will provide breathing space for the BCRP to allow for more expansionary policy to support economic growth. By 2021 the Peruvian economy will be on an upswing, allowing the central bank to start a tightening cycle.

We expect Peru's economy to pick up in the forecast period, but the annual average rate of 3.6% in 2018-21 will be much lower than during the commodities boom. This partly reflects the dampening effects of slowdowns forecast in China and the US, in 2018-19 and 2020, respectively.
GDP growth picked up to 0.7% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2017, after weak first-quarter growth of 0.2%, partly reflecting flooding brought on by the El Niño weather phenomenon. The recovery in the second half will continue, but growth for 2017 as a whole will be tepid, at 2.5%, as the government struggles to implement infrastructure plans amid transparency issues, congress-sional opposition, and ineffective and cumbersome regulatory procedures that hinder public expenditure and project implement-ation. These problems have recently been exemplified by two projects: the Gasoducto del Sur, a gas pipeline scheme that reverted to the state after financing fell through owing to corruption investigations, and the project to build the new Chinchero International Airport near Cusco, the controversy over which led to the ousting of two ministers and the scrapping of the entire project. Notwithstanding these obstacles, we expect the pace of public investment to accelerate in the forecast period. We expect private consumption growth to pick up, but it is unlikely that consumption will return to the growth rates seen in the past decade, given limited progress in addressing levels of labour informality that are among the highest regionally.
Peru's economy will remain dominated by mining, but the main productivity gains will come from the agro-industrial sector, which has grown quickly in recent years. Manufacturing will continue to face constraints related to external competition, fluctuations in global demand competition and a lack of skilled labour. All of this will discourage investment in the sector, leaving foreign investment mainly focused on the mining sector. Services growth will be supported by expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. The continued expansion of an emerging middle class will boost the services sector.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Industry will grow by an annual average of 4.4% in 2017-21, although its growth rate will be skewed by stronger performance at the start of the forecast period. Although prices for copper and other key metals exports have recovered during the first half of the year (and we expect them to continue recovering into 2019), they will not reach the levels seen during the commodities supercycle, which will depress investment. Indeed, investment in mining has been waning since reaching a high of US$10bn in 2013, and the current pipeline of projects suggests that output growth will taper-off after 2017. A forecast slowdown in China (a key trading partner) in 2018 will also contribute to less dynamic mining performance and investment. Peru, however, retains significant mineral wealth and the government calculates that potential mining projects, principally in copper, gold, iron ore and silver, could mean as much as US$50bn in new investment. We expect much more modest investment, as several of the largest projects the government is counting on are on standby while companies either resolve financing issues or face opposition from local communities. Community groups oppose the arrival of mining investment, citing concerns about damage to the environment and the fact that not enough locals are hired to work at the mines. Anti-mining protests often turn violent and mining projects suffer delays. Regardless, Peru will retain its place as a pre-eminent copper producer (it is currently the second-largest producer in the world, behind Chile) and mining output show consistent, albeit unimpressive, growth.
Manufacturing will also remain fairly dynamic, despite its vulnerability to fluctuations in demand from the US and China, and competitiveness issues brought on by the combination of low productivity, an appreciated real exchange rate and myriad Free-Trade Agreements. As such, the areas that will see the most growth will be extractive or non-tradeable in nature. Significant investments in 2017-21, including in the expanding petrochemicals sector and gas pipeline infrastructure, will boost industrial capacity in the latter part of the forecast period. Successive administrations have moved towards the medium- to-long-term goal of developing industrial centres that will take advantage of the high quantity of ethane in Peruvian gas to produce polyethylene and other petrochemicals. The construction of large hydroelectric plants in the Amazon region will also boost growth in the energy sector. Construction, which has boomed in recent years, will continue to expand during the forecast period, although at a slower rate. This will be driven by the Kuczynski government's plans for public infrastructure projects (electrification, sanitation, housing, roads and new transport facilities in major cities), and private projects, including large retail investments in secondary cities and industrial schemes (such as a natural-gas pipeline, hydroelectric plants and mining projects).
Agriculture will record average annual growth of 3.2% in the forecast period, although the figure is skewed by the poor growth of 2017, at 2%, owing to the effects of the "coastal El Niño" weather pattern, which brought massive flooding and loss of crops. Peru is carving out a niche in international markets for agro-exports, taking advantage of growing conditions at home and new opportunities created by Peru's numerous FTA agreements. Considerable investment in irrigation and export capacity has gone into the sector in the past years, and output will be lifted in the latter part of the forecast period by the completion of large irrigation projects in the southern and northern coastal areas. These will add more than 100,000 ha of new farmland. The fishing sector is expected to grow moderately, with the focus shifting from traditional fishmeal and fish-oil exports towards fish for human consumption.
Services are expected to grow by an annual average of 3.1% in 2017-21, lower than that of recent years, owing to slower growth and constrained consumption. Regardless, growth in services will be supported by expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. Planned expansion of large retail chains across the capital, Lima, and in smaller cities will respond to the changing consumer patterns of a growing middle class. Tourism will gain in importance, as infrastructure (such as the construction of a modern airport in Cusco), and hence access to the country's main tourism destinations, improves gradually. The continued emergence of a growing middle class will boost the services sector and will gradually contribute more to Peru's GDP growth as the latest wave of investment comes to an end.

Despite a pick-up owing to supply shortages caused by extreme weather, we expect annual inflation (2.9% in July) to return to a downward trajectory, ending 2017 at 2.6% and remaining inside the BCRP's 1-3% target band in 2018-21. Lower demand pressures will help the BCRP to bring inflation into the target band, although higher international energy costs and moderate currency weakening will counter this to some extent. There are several risks to this forecast, including adverse weather, which could drive up food prices, as well as pronounced currency depreciation, which would lead to higher import costs.

After appreciating during the first four months of 2017, the sol has since hovered at around S3.25:1US$1. In the coming months, we expect the sol to gradually depreciate, ending the year at S3.3: US$1. On an annual average basis, however, we expect the exchange rate to strengthen in 2017 as a whole before depreciating by an average of 1.3% per year in 2018-21. Debt and investment inflows will provide support for the sol. We expect the BCRP to continue to intervene in currency markets to smooth volatility while accumulating reserves. The BCRP will continue to support the ongoing process of de-dollarisation and protection of the financial sector, which is moderately exposed to currency risk. The balance of risks is tilted towards greater sol weakening. However, the risk of sharper than expected depreciation is mitigated by confidence in the monetary policy framework, strong reserves and steady long-term capital inflows.

The trade surplus will come in at US$3.7bn in 2017, owing to strong external demand in conjunction with a recovery in prices of Peru's key commodities exports. However, as terms of trade deteriorate and import growth outpaces export growth, the trade surplus will fall to an average of US$2.4bn in 2018-21. We expect the primary income deficit to remain below the level seen in previous years, at an average of 4.5% of GDP in 2017-21. The secondary income (transfers) surplus will average 1.8% of GDP in 2017-21, owing to high levels of remittances. As a result, the current-account deficit will remain mostly stable, averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21. Peru's current-account deficit will be financed by inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, which we expect to reach US$5.7bn (2.7% of GDP) in full-year 2017. We expect inflows to average 2.4% of GDP in a more challenging international environment in 2018-19, before recovering slightly, to 2.8% of GDP in 2021. FDI will not reach the levels seen in 2010-12, when inflows averaged 5.5% of GDP.

Foreign reserves stood at US$61.4bn on August 22nd, equivalent to 15.6 months of import cover. We expect reserves to grow slightly in nominal terms in the forecast period and although import cover will ease to 12.8 months by 2021, this will offer adequate protection against external shocks.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Peru
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) peaked in 2012 at a historic high of US$11.8bn (6.2% of GDP). FDI flows have since ebbed, reflecting the end of the commodities boom, reaching US$6.9bn in 2016 (3.5% of GDP). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to largely remain close to (albeit below) 3% of GDP in 2017-21, owing to weak governability and lower export prices when compared with 2007-12, when FDI inflows averaged 5.5% of GDP. The stock of inward FDI totalled US$91.5bn at end-2016, or 46.8% of GDP. Peru does not have significant outflows of FDI; these totalled only US$303m in 2016, resulting in a stock of just US$4.2bn. Despite its small size, this stock has increased sharply over the past decade.
Origin and distribution
According to the government's investment-promotion agency, ProInversión, by end-2016 Spain, the UK and the US respectively accounted for 18%, 17% and 13% of the accumulated FDI stock in the country, followed by Chile (12%), the Netherlands (6%) and Brazil (5%). The stock of FDI was dominated by the mining sector, with 23% of the total, ahead of telecommunications (19%), finance (19%), energy (14%) and industry (13%); all other sectors had low single-digit shares. This suggests that there is considerable potential outside the traditional recipient sectors, with retail, transport, and tourism considerably under-represented compared with their shares of FDI in similar economies. One notable investment in the past resulted from the sale of the national telephone company to Telefónica (Spain), which partly explains that country's (and the telecoms sector's) large share of the FDI stock.
Determinants
Macroeconomic stability and liberalisation in the 1990s allowed for large increases in FDI inflows, following a period of sharp economic recession in the late 1980s. Annual average inflows rose from the negligible amounts of the 1980s to US$1.7bn (3.5%% of GDP) in the 1990s. During the first half of the 1990s in particular, the government aggressively pursued foreign investment in privatisation, above all in communications and financial services, and the development of abundant mining and energy resources. The implementation of business-friendly policies in the early 2000s, coupled with political stability-in addition to an ongoing rise in commodity prices throughout most of the last decade-helped to boost FDI inflows to an average of US$3.7bn in 2000-10, and to an average of US$9bn in 2011-15. During 2017-21 the government will continue to seek to attract private investment into mining, hydroelectricity, hydrocarbons exploration and infrastructure projects, although a less favourable global outlook for commodities than in the past suggests that efforts to diversify into other sectors (such as services) could prove increasingly lucrative.
Impact
Increases in FDI during the mid-1990s funded a growing share of gross fixed investment. The impact of FDI on the wider economy in terms of technology transfer has been confined mainly to the spillover effects from a much-improved telecoms sector and a more efficient financial services sector, with investment in mining having only limited links to the rest of the economy. This is changing, as foreign investment in natural gas and hydroelectricity is improving sources of energy. The award of infrastructure concessions will also promote economic development across various regions (some of which are relatively poor). An estimated US$80bn shortfall in infrastructure and communications investment will also be a driver for increased public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Potential
Although the administration of the president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, aims to boost the declining inflows of FDI, the outlook for limited government effectiveness and low metal prices (compared with the previous decade) will weigh on investment inflows. Complex legislation and procedures on public tenders will also delay public private partnerships in infrastructure plans. Regardless, Peru's improving track record of prudent policymaking, free-trade agreements with the US and the EU (which include FDI clauses), and Peru's rich hydrocarbon and minerals resources will continue to pique interest during the forecast period. Although the pipeline of projects over the next decade includes more than US$55bn in mining projects and more than US$10bn in hydroelectric plants, the actual investment flows will be lower. owing to bureaucratic delays, local opposition, governability concerns, difficulty with environmental licences and pessimism about the direction of metals prices. Other areas that will receive investment include hydrocarbons exploration, transport infrastructure, water and sanitation, petrochemicals, and telecoms. Non-capital investment will be led by the financial and tourism sectors.

The emerging middle class will expand, but remain concentrated in urban areas
Although the Peruvian consumer market will remain characterised largely by inequality, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class. Over the past decade, the capital, Lima, where most affluent consumers are concentrated, has seen a rapid transformation in consumer patterns. Retail and entertainment chains have expanded from the traditional wealthy areas, owing to increasing demand from lower-income districts and the emerging neighbourhoods (former slums) located in the periphery of the metropolitan area. This new consumer demand is also evident in secondary cities such as Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Cusco, Piura, Iquitos and Ica, where economic growth has had a wider impact. However, the growth of market opportunities will still be limited to urban areas, and the majority of the population (particularly in rural areas) will continue to have low disposable income during the forecast period.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects average annual GDP growth of 3.4% in 2017-21-solid in historical terms, but a marked deceleration from 2012-16-to contribute to the continued gradual expansion of the middle class as the number of formal-sector jobs grows, albeit from a low base. The economy is expected to generate jobs for unskilled and skilled workers alike. However, those who remain in rural areas, or are confined to the informal sector by a lack of skills (where underemployment will keep the supply of labour high and will hold down income), will continue to see fewer benefits from economic growth.
The government's efforts to reduce labour costs-especially at small firms-could help to increase formal job creation, but raising skill levels will prove challenging, given poor educational outcomes. Although an increase in conditional cash transfer programmes will increase purchasing power for lower-income groups, their access to consumer goods and services will remain limited. Despite a sharp reduction in overall poverty levels (from more than half the population in 2000 to less than a quarter today), indigenous communities in the Andes and the Amazon areas will remain isolated, and high levels of illiteracy will persist, although literacy programmes have made some progress during the past decade.

Poverty and social inequality will remain barriers to market growth
Owing to still high levels of poverty and vast social inequalities, the total size of the population is a poor guide to market opportunities in Peru. The World Bank estimates the country's Gini coefficient (a widely used indicator of inequality, with zero equalling complete equality and 1 maximal inequality) at 0.441 in 2014, less than in some other regional economies, but high by global standards. Low inflation, steady growth of real incomes and targeted poverty-alleviation programmes will gradually lift more families out of poverty, allowing the share of food in overall household expenditure slowly to decline, although it will remain high by international standards. Increased household incomes will bring about a shift in consumption patterns, with food and beverages losing ground to expenses in healthcare and telecommunications. Over time, growth of credit will encourage increased expenditure on durable consumer goods by a greater proportion of the overall population and those living outside the capital, Lima.
The market is geographically skewed, with metropolitan Lima accounting for just under 30% of the population, well over 50% of all economic activity and 75% of consumer bank credit. Although Lima will continue to be the focus for investors, they will increasingly tap demand in areas outside the capital. Indeed, the last few years have seen a rapid expansion of retailers in the larger cities along the coast and in the Andes, and although economic growth will be moderate in 2017-21, this trend is likely to continue in the medium term. Greater market integration is also expected as the government continues to increase spending on infrastructure. Growth, macroeconomic stability, low tariffs and a plentiful supply of foreign exchange should allow Peru to become a more significant importer of consumer goods. This trend will be accelerated by greater access to the US, Chinese and European markets under free-trade agreements. Although Peru's population is ageing, it will remain much younger than in developed markets, and the ongoing demographic boom will make consumption patterns more dynamic.

Initial conditions: Peru's real GDP growth averaged 3.2% between 1982 and 2015, and growth of real GDP per head averaged 1.1%. However, these figures disguises a marked improvement in economic performance during the 1990s, when the policy environment was transformed and the economy was liberalised after a period of macroeconomic instability in the 1980s, character-ised by a debt crisis and hyperinflation later in the decade. These policy improvements spurred economic growth in the 2000s and helped the economy to withstand the 2008-09 global financial crisis fairly well. Although rapid GDP growth over the past two decades has enabled Peru to catch up with the Latin American median in terms of GDP per head, it is still well below that of developed countries. Weaker external conditions and slow progress in pushing the reform agenda forwards to tackle longstanding structural issues means that Peru will still lag behind developed economies by 2030. Peru is well endowed with natural resources-ranging from metals and natural gas to productive agricultural land. Its main weaknesses are the poor quality of its institutions, coupled with widespread income and regional inequalities. Overall education levels will remain low, and the slow pace of institutional improvement, together with lower investment in capital spending, will be the main factors behind a slowdown in average annual growth in the second half of the long-term outlook period. Opportunities in energy and mining will continue to foster investment. Nevertheless, with export-oriented industries the mainstay of the economy, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and commodities prices.
Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects population growth to average 1.1% annually in 2017-30, before slowing to 0.6% per year in 2031-50. Fertility will decline in line with continued urbanisation, but the birth rate will remain relatively high, even by Latin American standards, and well above developed-country norms. Declining fertility and increasing life expectancy point to an ageing population. However, even by the end of the long-term forecast period, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over, at around 17%, will remain much lower than in OECD countries. Lower birth-rates and the current low numbers of pensioners means that the dependency ratio (the ratio of children and elderly to the working-age population) will bottom out at 51% by 2034, before beginning a steady upward trend. Emigration has been substantial enough to have had an impact on population growth; each year, around 300,000 individuals are estimated to leave Peru to seek work abroad, although significant numbers have returned in recent years, as the economy has expanded rapidly and opportunities in traditional migrant destinations such as Spain have been limited. However, economic growth, by increasing disposable income for those in work, will put the option of emigration within reach of a greater proportion of the population, and the gap in economic opportunities between Peru and a variety of countries, including the US and neighbouring Chile, will remain wide. Internal migration will also have a decisive influence on the development of the economy. The level of urbanisation will rise from its present level of just under 79%, but it is already high by global standards, so the increase will be modest.
External conditions: The export-oriented sectors of the Peruvian economy, ranging from mining to export agriculture, have long been the most dynamic. Peru is expected to continue to benefit from free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, the main market for non-traditional exports, and China, which over the past few years has been trading places with the US as the recipient of the largest proportion of total exports. FTAs with the EU and other Asian economies will provide similar benefits. Integration efforts within Latin America are also gaining pace, particularly under the auspices of the Pacific Alliance, an integration pact composed of Peru, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, which focuses not only on trade in goods, but also on services, capital and free movement of people. Global trade flows will outpace world output growth over the long term, and Peru's increasing integration with the world economy should allow the country to benefit from global demand. Although the Peruvian economy is highly exposed to world commodity prices, the easing of the commodities supercycle and the corresponding deterioration of Peru's terms of trade will be partly mitigated by greater export diversification.
Institutions and policy trends: Peru's institutions were weakened during the 1990s under the rule of the then president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000). The media and forces in Congress became co-opted by the executive, and the political system became more authoritarian. The transition from Mr Fujimori's regime highlighted popular demands for a greater degree of effective democracy and decentralisation, made evident by rising protests in Peru's regions. Nevertheless, the quality of institutions remains weak, characterised by a politicised judiciary, widespread corruption and the lack of a strong political-party system, which leads to legislative fragmentation. Despite the efforts of the president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, little progress in addressing these issues is expected, given the government's relative political weakness and the pervasiveness of the issue. Despite this, our long-term forecast assumes that improvements in the conduct of economic policy and in the policy environment will largely be sustained. We expect the public finances to be prudently managed, characterised by low debt levels. Bureaucracy will gradually be reduced and the business environment, which in some respects remains non-conducive to entrepreneurship, will improve. Increased spending on healthcare and education will gradually have productivity-enhancing effects. Private investment will lead to improvements in infrastructure. A continued commitment to inflation targeting by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (the central bank), along with responsible fiscal management and a low debt stock, will help to maintain macroeconomic stability, while a flexible exchange rate will help the economy to cope with external shocks.
Long-term performance: We forecast average real GDP growth of 4% per year in 2021-30, easing to an average of 3.1% in 2031-50; this is strong by regional standards. Past reforms, in particular the establishment of private pension funds, will continue to bear fruit, helping to deepen capital markets and raise the savings rate. Nevertheless, growth is likely to be focused on resource-intensive areas, export agriculture and specialised areas of manufacturing, such as textiles. Relatively low levels of education for the majority, coupled with low spending on research and development-at less than 1% of GDP-will constrain the economy from moving into higher value-added areas, despite frequent attempts by governments to improve domestic productive capacity and develop industrial clusters. Economic performance will become more dependent on productivity gains as growth in the labour force slows and the economy continues to adapt to the end of the commodities supercycle. Reflecting investments made in previous years and slow but sustained institutional improvements, labour productivity will rise by an average of 2.4% in 2017-50. We expect GDP per head, measured at purchasing-power parity levels, to increase to 36.7% of the US level by 2050, up from just 20.4% in 2016.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]the government is weak and vulnerable to political manoeuvrings within the PD and the wider coalition ahead of the next election. Because of the fragmentation of the political system into three main blocs-the centre left, the centre right and the Eurosceptic, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-and the return to a strongly proportional one-round electoral system, we expect that there will be no clear winner at the next general election. According to a survey conducted by Ifop, a pollster, for Le Journal du Dimanche, a weekly newspaper, Mr Macron's approval ratings slipped by 10 percentage points in July and by a further 14 points in August, to just 40% (significantly lower than his two immediate predecessors, François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, at this stage in their presidencies). [...]a durable alliance remains elusive, and it is unclear whether a broad centre-right formation would poll as well as the sum of its constituent parties. [...]there is no consensus on who would head such a coalition; Silvio Berlusconi, FI's leader, remains reluctant to accept the leadership of the Lega Nord's Matteo Salvini, who opinion polls suggest is the favoured candidate among centre-right supporters. The BoE is likely to hold rates down until 2021 In 2016 the BoE took several steps to limit the financial and economic fallout from the Brexit vote. Since August 2016 the MPC has kept the main policy interest rate at 0.25%, the stock of government bond purchases at £435bn (US$581bn) and the stock of corporate bond purchases at £10bn.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars and the legacy of the cold war, during which Europe was divided into two blocs. The ending of Soviet control over central and eastern Europe from 1989, followed by the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than that of other east European countries. The effects of war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-east Europe.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and healthy levels of political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-in particular those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at the EU level. Nineteen EU member states share the euro as their currency. These countries are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank (ECB). They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have often been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. Although the euro zone crisis has passed its peak, normalisation remains a long way off. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during its medium-term forecast period (2017-21). Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster and more successfully with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Populist parties did not triumph in elections across Europe in 2017, but popular disaffection with mainstream parties will persist.
The main question in the September 24 federal election in Germany is not who will win the largest share of the vote, but which party or parties will join the likely winner, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in a new coalition.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU to result in a deal in March 2019 on a transitional period lasting up to two years, but the risk that negotiations will break down is significant.
The collapse of Iceland's government in September 2017 is the latest example of how increased political fragmentation is making it more difficult to form stable governments and implement policy.
We expect EU sanctions on Russia to be maintained and for relations with Russia to remain difficult.
Economic policy
If the UK economy remains resilient to Brexit uncertainty, there is a chance that the Bank of England will reverse the post-referendum interest rate cut of 0.25%. If growth momentum slows, however, the prospects of a rate rise will fade.
We expect the monetary stance to remain exceptionally loose across much of the rest of the region. We do not expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to increase policy rates by 2021.
There could be some rebalancing of the mix between monetary and fiscal policy in the euro zone as governments seek to respond to voter dissatisfaction. However, the bloc's rigid fiscal rules could make this a contentious process.
Economic reform has progressed well in some countries, notably the Baltic states, Spain and Ireland, but for most the main challenges lie ahead. With political fragmentation on the rise, policymaking is becoming more difficult.
Economic growth
We expect a growth slowdown in the UK in 2017-19 as Brexit negotiations heighten uncertainty, before growth accelerates in 2019-21.
We forecast a pick-up in average real GDP growth in the EU28 to 2.1% in 2017 and an average of 1.7% in 2018-21.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook: Political stability
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a challenge to the future cohesion of the bloc. Despite the professed unity of the other 27 member states, the departure of one of the biggest members is a profound shock. Brexit represents a further stage in a rolling regional political and economic crisis that began in 2010. This crisis has been defined by a failure of the region's institutions to provide effective governance and leadership in response to political and economic challenges. The early stages of the crisis were characterised by challenges to the survival of the single currency. The threat of a euro zone break-up has receded as firewalls have been put in place, notably through the intervention of the European Central Bank (ECB), and the economic recovery has gathered pace in recent years, but the euro crisis has not yet been banished. The intra-bloc tensions that it has engendered, especially between northern and southern states and between east and west, were compounded by the 2014-15 migration crisis. This crisis strengthened anti-establishment and anti-EU political parties, which in recent years have given voice to popular disaffection with mainstream political parties.
In managing its multiple crises since 2010, the region has resorted to "muddling through". This policy approach has been moderately successful so far, certainly when compared with some of the disastrous outcomes that could have transpired. However, muddling through does not offer a long-term strategy for addressing the region's problems, and it has eroded the political capital of the policymakers involved. The region faces major unanswered questions, not least about its relatively poor economic growth and productivity performance compared with the US and with developing regions such as Asia, and about whether further integration in the euro zone is economically necessary and politically feasible. The resistance of policymakers to confronting these questions head on should not be underestimated. However, if Europe's leaders continue with this muddle-through policy, the political and economic costs may prove to be their undoing.
Populist parties fail to take power, but popular disaffection will persist
Many have interpreted the results of recent elections in Austria, the Netherlands, France and the UK as a defeat for populist forces in Europe. The disappointing result for the Front national (FN) in France, for example, has been taken as proof that populism has run its course. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that this is a mistaken view. The persistence of popular disaffection with the status quo was very much evident in the presidential and parliamentary elections in France, where anti-establishment parties attracted more support than la République en marche (LRM), the party of the president, Emmanuel Macron, and high abstention rates indicated widespread dissatisfaction with all parties.
Our expectation was not that populist parties would take power in major elections this year. However, we expected that some of them would continue to serve as vehicles for expressing widespread popular disenchantment with the established political order, giving them increasing influence in shaping the main topics of domestic political debate. We anticipate growing difficulties with coalition-building as disparate mainstream parties try to find common ground to work together to keep the populists out of power.
Populist parties have shown themselves to be more prepared than the main-stream parties to debate the big political issues of the day, such as the impact of globalisation on income equality and national identity, and they have mobilised people to become engaged in the political process and to vote. Ruling elites have responded by seeking to delegitimise the insurgent parties, and they have sometimes adopted some of the populists' rhetoric and policies. Even if some of today's populist movements dissipate or their support dwindles, we expect that popular disaffection will continue to cause political upsets and that there is little likelihood of a return to the stable post-war political order in Europe.
The Brexit negotiations will test EU cohesion
The Brexit negotiations began in June 2017, after the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29th, beginning the formal two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the bloc. In the Article 50 letter, Theresa May, the prime minister, confirmed that the UK would not seek membership of the EU's single market. This is in line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and budget. The UK will also leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The UK would like to have tariff-free access to EU markets, but customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and would prevent the UK from negotiating trade deals with other countries. The UK will therefore try to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU and has proposed alternatives to customs union membership, including a "highly streamlined" arrangement and a new customs "partnership".
Negotiations over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU are taking place on a four-week cycle. So far the talks have made some progress on important issues relating to Northern Ireland and citizens' rights, but given the divergence in views on a range of other issues, including the financial settlement, we do not expect "sufficient progress" to have been made by the EU summit in October-a condition set by the EU for discussions on trade to begin. However, we expect a breakthrough by the December summit. This will push back the timeline for trade talks, but the impact on the final outcome will be limited if, as we expect, a transitional period is agreed after the UK's withdrawal at the end of March 2019. At that stage the UK will formally leave the single market, but the new relationship will be phased in gradually, to minimise disruption. This could mean continued adherence to EU rules until the new agreement is ratified.
The UK has committed to paying some financial liabilities, but the EU will also have to show flexibility if it is to avoid deadlock. We expect that a deal will be reached on a transitional period lasting up to two years, but the risk that the negotiations could break down is significant. If negotiations fail and an extension of the deadline is not agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal and revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules. The chances of an amicable divorce from the EU are slim, but both sides have an incentive to agree a deal given the mutual benefits of maintaining economic, political and security relations.
The result of the June 2017 snap general election in the UK heightened uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations. The decision of Mrs May to call an early general election on June 8th backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May has lost authority but could stay in place because her party fears another general election, which it could lose given that momentum is with the main opposition Labour Party. The Conservatives have formed a working government based on a "confidence and supply" arrange-ment with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
This arrangement is likely to work in the short term because neither party wants another election, they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the government's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
Another threat to political stability and government effectiveness is the division in the cabinet between pro- and anti-EU forces over the government's Brexit strategy. The Brexiteers in the cabinet and the Conservative Party have been supportive of Mrs May since the election because they want her to hold fast to her earlier pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the ECJ. This faction includes the Brexit secretary, David Davis; the international trade secretary, Liam Fox; the environment minister, Michael Gove; and the foreign affairs minister, Boris Johnson. They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit, who favour an extended post-2019 transition period during which the UK would retain single market access, including the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond; the home secretary, Amber Rudd; and the first secretary of state, Damian Green. There is a risk that cabinet divisions over Brexit will intensify, leading to a leadership challenge and even the collapse of the government. The minority government will do well to last the duration of the Brexit negotiations, until March 2019 (with or without Mrs May), and there is a significant risk of another pre-term election.
After leading his movement to power, the hard work begins now for Mr Macron
Emmanuel Macron, the leader of a new centrist party in France, la République en marche (LRM), began a five-year term as president on May 14th 2017. He succeeded François Hollande of the centre-left Parti socialiste (PS), who left office as the most unpopular president of the post-war period. The prime minister, Édouard Philippe, hails from the main centre-right party, Les Républicains, balancing out Mr Macron's ties with the PS after two years as economy minister under Mr Hollande. He leads a post-partisan government with several figures from the private sector. LRM and its centrist ally, Mouvement démocrate (MoDem), have a comfortable majority in parliament, with 413 out of 577 seats between their two parliamentary groups. The government also benefits from support from a group of 35 moderate "Constructive" deputies from Les Républicains and its centre-right ally, the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI).
Mr Macron came into office on a promise of economic reform and political renewal. His policy agenda includes ideas from both the left and the right, and he encouraged non-politicians to run for office to bring a broader range of people into the National Assembly. In the current parliament only 25% of deputies are incumbents, the share of women has risen to 39% and the average age has fallen to 49. Mr Macron is also intent on elevating the presidency after public approval of the office suffered under Nicolas Sarkozy's hyperactivity and Mr Hollande's attempt to be an "ordinary man". In contrast, Mr Macron aspires to embody a "Jupiterian" presidency, setting the government's strategic direction but remaining aloof from day-to-day affairs. His address to both houses of parliament at Versailles in July was an initial example of this approach, with a lofty "state of the union" speech, which he intends to make an annual event.
In the presidential and parliamentary elections Mr Macron and LRM won decisive shares of the vote, with 66% and 43% of second-round votes respectively. However, the scale of this victory was qualified by unusually high abstention. In the second round of the presidential election 34% of voters abstained or submitted a blank or spoiled ballot, and in the legislative election the equivalent figure was 62%. This indicates a significant share of public dis-satis-faction with the electoral options available, including Mr Macron and LRM. Those voters who have disengaged with the political process are more likely to express their discontent on the street. With trade union protests taking place in September and more planned-backed by a newly resurgent far-left party, La France insoumise, under Jean-Luc Mélenchon-we anticipate a disruptive degree of public resistance to the president's reform agenda.
However, we do not expect these protests to derail Mr Macron's plans or stymie policymaking to the degree that similar protests did under Mr Hollande. Nor is the resistance that Mr Macron will face in parliament likely to be enough to block legislative progress. The largest opposition party, Les Républicains (with 112 seats), has split into two parliamentary groups-a "constructive" group of deputies sympathetic to the president's reform plans, and the rest of the party-and the formerly ruling PS now has only 30 seats. Mr Macron could face resistance from within his own party however, especially as some of LRM's newer deputies gain experience and start to assert themselves. His parlia-mentary majority is sufficiently large that Mr Macron can afford some rebellion on the backbenches, but he will want to avoid a repeat of the public splits in the PS under Mr Hollande's presidency.
We expect Angela Merkel to remain in power after the 2017 election
Despite a marked increase in political volatility in Germany since 2015-largely as a result of the unprecedented number of migrant arrivals-the country is likely to remain, in comparative terms, a source of political stability in Europe. Germany's current government-comprising a grand coalition of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)-is led by Angela Merkel, who is in her third term as chancellor. Our baseline forecast is that the CDU/CSU will win the largest share of the vote in the September election and that Ms Merkel will continue as chancellor.
Election result puts to rest speculation about a Dutch exit from the euro or the EU
The parliamentary election in the Netherlands on March 15th 2017 led to a fragmented result, with the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) winning the most seats in the 150-seat parliament, with 33, down from 41 in 2012. The right-wing, populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, which is the main outlet for public frustration with much of the traditional political mainstream, came second, albeit with 13 seats fewer than the VVD.
Coalition negotiations have been difficult and are continuing. The VVD, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and Democrats 66 (D66) have made several attempts at forming a coalition, first with GreenLeft (GL), then with the Christian Union (CU), and then with GL again. They are currently in discussions with the CU again. Despite deep differences remaining between the CU and D66, especially on medical-ethical issues, a leaked compromise in mid-August suggested that the parties were close to reaching an agreement. However, given the secretive nature of these talks, a risk remains that the parties will fail to form a government together. This four-party coalition would enjoy only a wafer-thin majority in both houses of parliament, heightening the risk of an early election. As this would leave few other options for a majority coalition, there is an increased risk that the parties will fall back on a minority coalition, or even a renewed election, although we would expect a lot more time to pass before either option (especially a renewed election) is considered.
The impact on the economic outlook of this protracted period of policy uncertainty, including the budget for 2018 being put together by a caretaker government and thus remaining broadly unchanged, is minimal given the strength of the economy and the public finances, and the fact that there is little need for immediate significant reforms.
Italy remains a particular pressure point within the euro zone. The over-whelming rejection of the flagship constitutional reform of the then prime minister and leader of the Partito Democratico (PD), Matteo Renzi, in a referendum in December 2016 has increased political instability, which will hinder prospects for political and economic reform in Italy. We expect that the coalition government formed by Paolo Gentiloni of the dominant centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) in December 2016 will remain in place until the end of the current parliamentary term, in early 2018. However, the government is weak and vulnerable to political manoeuvrings within the PD and the wider coalition ahead of the next election. Because of the fragmentation of the political system into three main blocs-the centre left, the centre right and the Eurosceptic, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-and the return to a strongly proportional one-round electoral system, we expect that there will be no clear winner at the next general election. This will complicate government formation, which is likely to lead to the establishment of another executive backed by a broad centre-left/centre-right coalition and possibly led by Mr Gentiloni. Consequently, we expect the next government to be unstable, limiting its effectiveness and its ability to pass long-overdue political and economic reforms. A government led by M5S cannot be ruled out, as we expect it to emerge as the largest party in parliament after the election. However, it is unlikely given the leadership's refusal to work with the mainstream parties.
A shift to one-man-rule and deepening polarisation in Turkey will continue
The intense political instability in Turkey that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, we maintain our negative medium-term political outlook. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened the social and political divisions. The "justice march" from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul, headed by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), ended peacefully on July 9th, but further protests are likely, keeping high the risk of clashes between protesters and pro-government supporters or a government clampdown. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent president and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have continued to tighten their grip on power. The state of emergency law introduced after the failed coup has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis. We expect it to remain in place for the foresee-able future, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and silence government critics. More than 100,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Political outlook: French government unveils labour market reform bill
The government unveiled its labour market reform bill on August 31st, fulfilling a campaign pledge to prioritise this legislation in a bid to reduce the high level of unemployment. The bill essentially increases flexibility for employers and scales back France's notoriously high levels of worker protection. It is now with the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), which will vote on September 22nd, but the large parliamentary majority of the president, Emmanuel Macron, means that the bill's passage into law is assured, despite opposition from some trade unions. Our expectation is that the reform will lead to an improvement in labour market conditions, but that it will not be enough on its own to prompt the kind of job-creation that would result in a significant fall in unemployment.
Several major components of the current labour legislation will be retained, including the 35-hour working week and minimum-wage provisions, but the new bill introduces changes in many other areas. It will make it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to negotiate directly with their employees on issues pertaining to training and working conditions, rather than with a union appointee, as is currently the case. It also caps the indemnities that can be awarded by employment tribunals in cases of wrongful dismissal at between one month of salary (for workers employed for less than a year) and 20 months of salary (for workers employed for 30 years). Currently there is no cap on the payments that companies are required to make by employment tribunals, which in most cases rule in favour of the fired employee. Payouts can be huge, with little consistency between cases. Employees who have been fired will have a maximum of one year to file a case for wrongful dismissal, compared with two years currently.
Greater flexibility for SMEs and foreign multinationals
Many of the reform proposals relate specifically to SMEs, which account for about 30% of total employment, but there are also changes for large foreign companies with operations in France. These companies currently have to request permission before making French workers redundant, and although this process will remain intact, the ruling will now be decided by the company's financial results in France rather than their global results, as is currently the case. This will make it easier for foreign multinationals to scale back personnel if local operations are not proving profitable. However, severance payments will be raised slightly, to 25% of monthly salary for each year of employment, from 20% currently.
Previous presidents have tried and failed to increase labour market flexibility, but Mr Macron stands a much greater chance of success, owing to his large parliamentary majority. There is opposition from the public, labour unions and opposition political parties, but it is not particularly co-ordinated. One of the largest unions (and the most hardline), the Confédération générale du travail (CGT), called a strike on September 12th. Another large union, the Confédération française démocratique du travail (CFDT), joined the protests later, and another, Force Ouvrière (FO), is also planning protests. Others, including the Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens (CFTC), have been more circumspect, stating that the "worst has been avoided" in the formation of the proposed bill.
Opposition lacks cohesion
Jean-Luc Mélenchon's far-left party, La France insoumise, has also heavily criticised the bill, but despite a meeting between Mr Mélenchon and the head of the CGT, Philippe Martinez, on September 6th, the two men failed to agree on a plan of united opposition to the reform bill, with Mr Mélenchon organising his own protest action for September 23rd. Meanwhile, there is no clear line from the Parti socialiste (PS), the party of the previous government, although some factions have voiced criticism (albeit falling short of endorsing strike action). By contrast, the centre-right Les Républicains has been broadly supportive of the measures. The varied response from the main political actors, combined with the lack of co-ordination among those opposed to the bill, will work in Mr Macron's favour, reducing the likelihood of sustained industrial action and anti-government protests, which might have otherwise forced a watering down of some measures.
President's popularity is set to remain weak
This bodes well for the bill's safe and rapid passage into law, but will do little in the short term to reverse the slide in Mr Macron's popularity. According to a survey conducted by Ifop, a pollster, for Le Journal du Dimanche, a weekly newspaper, Mr Macron's approval ratings slipped by 10 percentage points in July and by a further 14 points in August, to just 40% (significantly lower than his two immediate predecessors, François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, at this stage in their presidencies). In large part this reflected discontent with Mr Macron's governing style, which was elevated and uncommunicative, rarely giving interviews (he has modified this in recent weeks, having realised that more communication was necessary), and political missteps such as his stand-off with General Pierre de Villiers, the former head of the armed forces, over the defence budget.
However, there is also public opposition to some of his policy changes, in particular a reduction of a housing supplement, the aide personnalisée au logement (APL), and the labour reform bill. The government had promised that the bill would promote "flexicurity", whereby labour market regulations would be simplified but in combination with stronger social protection for those who lost their jobs, but there is a sense among the public that the reform bill is more about increased flexibility for firms than better personal security for individuals. There is particular public disquiet about the loss of union representation in negotiations about working conditions.
The labour reform bill addresses important deficiencies in the current system and goes further than measures proposed during recent administrations. It will also benefit from a supportive economic context, with the euro zone experiencing a cyclical upswing at present and growth strengthening in France. However, reforms that make it easier for firms to dismiss workers do not typically result in a pick-up in job-creation on their own. For greater labour market flexibility to lead to a rise in employment, there must also be stronger incentives for firms to hire, a sufficient pool of trained workers and sufficient demand in the economy to make expansion worthwhile. Mr Macron does intend to pass further reforms to make the tax system more conducive to hiring and to expand training programmes, but these are unlikely to be immediate, and his determination to maintain a tight fiscal stance removes one lever that he could have used to boost aggregate demand. In any case, changing perceptions of the attractiveness of France's labour market will not happen overnight. Our forecast is that unemployment will edge down in 2017-18, before falling more noticeably in the final years of Mr Macron's mandate, on the assumption that progress in other areas of the reform agenda contribute to a more holistic improvement in the business environment.
Political outlook: Election watch
We expect political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period (2017-21). In the euro zone, in particular, the negative political fallout from the financial crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the post-war political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that fragmentation and difficulties forming a government occur even in countries that are registering solid rates of growth, such as Spain and Ireland, and in traditionally politically stable countries, such as the UK.
Centre right wins Norwegian election
Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus that typically delivers a high level of political stability. In the general election held on September 11th the centre-right parties in the Storting (parliament)-comprising the Conservatives, the Progress Party (FrP), the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals-emerged as the winners of the election, obtaining 88 seats out of 169 in parliament, giving the bloc a working majority of three. This left the centre-left parties with 81 seats, if the Green Party (MDG) is included. Erna Solberg, the leader of the Conservatives and the incumbent prime minister, benefited from the economic recovery and is likely to lead another centre-right government. However, despite securing a three-seat majority in this election, Ms Solberg will face significant challenges in leading another government, largely because the external support provided by the Liberals and the KrF during her previous term in office might no longer be assured.
Although in 2013-17 the ruling coalition could obtain majority support in parliament with the backing of only one of the junior centre-right parties, it will now need the support of both. The Liberals are likely to back Ms Solberg (even if it is unclear at this stage whether they will choose to enter government or remain an external ally), but we expect the KrF to refrain from supporting a government that involves the far-right FrP-a condition on which the party was firm throughout the election campaign. We therefore expect the KrF to go into opposition and to strike deals on a case-by-case basis, leaving the three remaining centre-right parties controlling only 81 seats in the Storting-four short of a majority. This would give the KrF leeway to vote with the centre left against tighter immigrant integration policies while supporting the centre right in business-friendly measures. It would also allow the party to disassociate itself from the expansive oil-drilling policy that both the Conservatives and the FrP defend. If this scenario materialises, we can expect a more protracted policy-making process, which could undermine government effectiveness and make it harder for the future ruling coalition to implement measures sought by the FrP. This could increase political instability in Norway, although it would remain limited by European standards. There are risks to this scenario, however, especially if the Conservatives manage to show the KrF that they will have a stronger hand with the FrP, and if they respond positively to the KrF's demands.
The CDU-CSU looks on course to win the election in Germany
In the September 24th federal election in Germany, currently governed by a grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its smaller Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), we expect the CDU to win a plurality of votes, but not a majority of seats. Recent polls show that the CDU has about 37% of public support, ahead of the SPD on 23%. As a result, a variety of CDU-led coalitions are possible, with Angela Merkel remaining as chancellor for a fourth term.
There is a general election in the Czech Republic in October 2017. We forecast that the centrist ANO movement, led by Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman and until recently the minister of finance, will gain the largest vote share and lead a majority coalition government, provided that it successfully manages any further controversies. A minority ANO-led government or anti-Babis rainbow coalition are alternative, but less likely, options. The next presidential election will be held in January 2018. In March Milos Zeman, aged 72, announced that he would be running for a second term, despite having health problems. Unless the other parties succeed in uniting around a single candidate, which appears unlikely, we expect him to win a second term. Mr Zeman, who has been a controversial and disruptive force in Czech politics in recent years, has forged an alliance with Mr Babis, but it remains to be seen whether this will be maintained after the presidential election.
Following several years of scant reform progress and coalition and party in-fighting in Austria, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017. This followed the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP and will run as the party's lead candidate in the early general election on October 15th. Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the ÖVP and that the party appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party". After Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) to third place, from first. The campaign still holds the potential to derail Mr Kurz's efforts, as he is inexperienced, especially on topics relating to economic policy-an area in which his main challenger, the current SPÖ chancellor, Christian Kern, is stronger. However, owing in part to the ÖVP's lead (it is polling around 33%, compared with 25% for the second-placed SPÖ), we expect the ÖVP to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
The election will be a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP will have been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be mostly drawing voters away from the FPÖ, in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens; NEOS, a liberal party; and List Pilz, a new group recently set up by Peter Pilz, a former Green member of parliament (MP)-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook are high, as the election could turn, and coalition negotiations could falter because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters and the FPÖ is likely to struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect little progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.
Iceland is to hold its second snap poll in the space of a year
On October 28th Iceland is set to hold its second snap election within a year, after the collapse of the coalition government, consisting of Bright Future (BF), the Independence Party (IP) and Vidreisn (Reform). On September 15th BF announced its withdrawal from the coalition, citing a "serious breach of trust within the government". This referred to recent news that Benedikt Sveinsson, a judge and the father of the prime minister and IP leader, Bjarni Benediktsson, had granted a controversial "restored honour" letter (which expunges a criminal record) to Hjalti Sigurjon Hauksson, who was convicted of raping his stepdaughter. Following a ruling by a parliamentary committee, the Ministry of Justice revealed the information, of which Mr Benediktsson had reportedly been aware since July. The news is likely to undermine further public trust in government, which had already been seriously damaged by the panama Papers leak in April 2016. The leak implicated the then prime minister, and prompted an early election, held in October 2016.
The election fragmented Iceland's parliament, making the government formation process extremely difficult and protracted. As such, the collapse of the government does not come as a big surprise. Coalition formation talks between the IP, BF and Vidreisn had already failed once before they reached an agreement in January 2017. BF provided the IP-led coalition with only four seats, but its withdrawal was enough to bring about the collapse of the government, which had only a one-seat majority in the 63-seat parliament. The IP has 21 seats and Vidreisn has seven. A snap election risks returning BF to the political sidelines, as the party has fallen below the 4% threshold for parliamentary representation in recent opinion polls, although it is possible that its support will increase in the wake of these events.
Before the next parliamentary election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018, the regional election in Sicily on November 5th could provide some indication of the relative strength of the political parties and their ability to form electoral coalitions. However, we continue to expect that the main contest at the parliamentary election will be between the PD and M5S. Support for the two parties remains broadly similar, at about 30%, according to opinion polls. Although M5S's credibility has been dented by recent political blunders and local-level scandals-most notably in the city government of Rome-we expect it to emerge as the largest party, boosted by Mr Renzi's defeat in the referendum, the split in the PD and an increase in anti-politics sentiment. However, under a strongly proportional voting system, we expect that M5S will not obtain a majority of parliamentary seats. This would require it to enter a coalition with other parties to form a government. Given M5S's hardline stance towards the established parties across the political spectrum, and these parties' concerns about M5S's policies, we believe it unlikely that M5S would succeed. It is more likely that the established parties will be persuaded to join forces to keep M5S out of government, leading to the establishment of an unstable coalition between the centre left and the centre right.
Recent polls suggest that the centre-right parties, led by Forza Italia (FI) and the Lega Nord, could hypothetically outperform both the PD and M5S. However, a durable alliance remains elusive, and it is unclear whether a broad centre-right formation would poll as well as the sum of its constituent parties. Moreover, there is no consensus on who would head such a coalition; Silvio Berlusconi, FI's leader, remains reluctant to accept the leadership of the Lega Nord's Matteo Salvini, who opinion polls suggest is the favoured candidate among centre-right supporters.
In Spain the political dysfunction has been pronounced. At end-October 2016, following an inconclusive general election in December 2015 and a re-run ballot six months later, parliament elected Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP), prime minister for a second term. However, Mr Rajoy's PP minority government is one of the weakest in Spain's democratic history, and we do not expect it to serve a full four-year term. It relies on just 170 votes-those of the PP, Ciudadanos (Citizens) and the Canary Island Coalition (CC)-in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies (the lower house of parliament).
We do not expect an early election until 2018 (when budget negotiations could prove to be a trigger point) or 2019. That the PP is keen to claim credit for strong economic growth and is currently topping opinion polls further supports this view, although the gap with the second-placed PSOE has begun to narrow. Over the medium term Spanish politics will remain fluid, with scant prospects for major political or economic reforms until a stronger administration enters office.
Another source of instability is the separatist challenge posed by Catalonia. The regional government has scheduled an independence referendum for October 1st, which it will consider binding, regardless of turnout. We believe that the vote is likely to go ahead in some form, and to deliver a strong vote for independence, but participation will be low, as the region's unionist political parties will boycott the ballot. The government's most likely response will be to ignore the result, ruthlessly prosecuting the referendum's organisers and using other legal means to prevent the regional government from breaking away. Ultimately, we think that Catalonia is unlikely to secede from Spain, although tensions in the region remain high, and there is a significant risk of unrest and a legal stand-off in the aftermath of the vote.
A presidential election will take place in Russia in March 2018. We expect Vladimir Putin, the president, to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round, owing to the lack of any credible alternative candidate. Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and one of the most dynamic of the "non-systemic" opposition leaders, will probably be barred from participating following a second conviction for de-frauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would cast doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate.
The next parliamentary and presidential elections in Turkey are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given the popularity of the president, and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him.

Political outlook: The inevitable chancellor's new coalition
The main question ahead of the federal election on September 24th is not who will win the largest share of the vote, but which party or parties will join the probable winner, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in forming a coalition, with the current chancellor, Angela Merkel, again at the helm.
Current polls suggest that the CDU could have its pick of a single smaller party, either The Greens or the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), or form a coalition with both. It could also form another grand coalition with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
As the margins are likely to be small, it remains impossible to say which exact coalition will emerge, although The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that another grand coalition is unlikely, in part because the SPD will be hesitant to enter another one.
For domestic policy, the differences will be limited. However, the smaller parties have considerably different views on reform of the euro zone. We expect this to factor into Ms Merkel's considerations for her choice of coalition partner, but it could also prove to be a brake on euro zone reform in the coming years.
Opinion polls have in recent months moved decisively in favour of Ms Merkel, both for her party and her personal approval rating. With the gap between the CDU and the SPD widening in the closing weeks of the election campaign, we expect the CDU to win the largest share of the vote. Ms Merkel has captured most of the middle ground in a country that has enjoyed several years of economic stability and growth, with a recent poll showing that 81% of the electorate are happy with their own economic situation-a historical high. She has thereby turned herself and her party into the default option for a large part of the electorate, who would clearly prefer stability to a shake-up of the apparently satisfying status quo. This has made it difficult for any challengers to come up with a platform on which to oppose her, especially now that the political salience of the refugee issue has diminished, as inflows have returned to normal levels after spiking during the European migrant crisis in 2015-16.
SPD struggles to stand out
Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament who took over the leadership of the SPD in early 2017, has evidently been found lacking in this regard by the German electorate. Following a short period of hype after his arrival on the domestic political scene-as he had spent most of his career in Brussels, he was largely unknown in Germany-both his personal approval ratings and his party's poll ratings have fallen back to only just above where they were at the end of 2016. His emphasis on social justice and on rolling back many of the labour market reforms that many Germans credit with the country's recent economic success has not captured the electorate's imagination. That the SPD seems not to have changed its election strategy since then, building its campaign so far around Mr Schulz and emphasising the same issues, has in our view made it even more unlikely that the SPD will pose a serious threat to the CDU.
The most interesting question that will be answered in the election is how the smaller parties will fare, as this will determine the type of coalition that will emerge. All of the smaller parties that are likely to cross the 5% electoral threshold-the FDP, The Greens, the Left Party and the far-right, populist Alternative for Germany (AfD)-are polling around 8-10%. However, the exact number of seats that they manage to win will be crucial for the subsequent coalition talks, as this will determine the number of parties needed for a CDU-led majority coalition.
Domestic policy stable, movement on euro zone reform possible
Assuming that the CDU wins the largest share of the vote, it will be first in line to try to form a coalition. The SPD would be highly unlikely to take the lead in forming a government in this event, as the three left-wing parties would almost certainly fall short of a majority of seats in the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), and in any case the SPD remains hesitant to work with the Left Party (the hard-left successor to East Germany's communist party).
We see four possible CDU-led coalitions after the election. Current polls suggest that it will be close as to whether the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), will be able to form a coalition with just one of the smaller parties or whether they will need two. We believe that there is some upside risk to the CDU's eventual vote share, making a two-party coalition without the SPD more likely to be possible.
The different coalitions would implement different domestic policies, for instance regarding the balance between tax cuts and additional public investment-the large fiscal surpluses in recent years have led to a broadly shared understanding that fiscal room has opened up-but we expect the differences to be relatively modest. A CDU-Green coalition would enact more green policies, for example expediting the closure of coal-fired power plants, and the FDP would demand large tax cuts. However, in part given the satisfaction with the status quo, we would not expect any party to push for a large-scale reform effort. The major question of interest will be to what degree Germany will be willing to work together with France to reform the institutions of the euro zone and, for instance, set up a European Monetary Fund. The CDU-CSU's choice of coalition partner or partners will have a large influence on this-although Germany will in any case only agree to increased risk-sharing if it is accompanied by increased oversight of national economic and budgetary policies.
Some coalitions would be less willing to work with the French president
The most natural ally for the CDU, based both on historical experience and overlap in election programmes, would be the FDP, with which Ms Merkel formed her second coalition government in 2009-13. The FDP would also be by far the preferred partner for the CSU, which tends to be slightly to the right of the CDU, especially under Ms Merkel. Although the FDP has been at pains to declare that it does not plan to enter government after the election, this is likely to be political posturing to make sure that potential voters do not defect to the CDU.
However, the FDP has taken a hard line on European issues, including against many of the reforms suggested by the new French president, Emmanuel Macron. Senior CDU figures, including Ms Merkel and the notoriously hardline finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, have already expressed a willingness to implement reform of the euro zone, including possibly more risk pooling. The CDU's willingness to move on this issue is visible in one of its campaign slogans, which claims that "strengthening Europe means strengthening Germany". The FDP would thus present a significant barrier to implementing the kind of reform that Ms Merkel might see as the crowning achievement of her decade-and-a-half chancellorship, or simply as a necessary step for the EU and the euro zone.
The second option would be a CDU-Green coalition. Although we do not have any privileged insight into Ms Merkel's thinking, we would expect this to be her preferred coalition partner. She has gravitated towards The Greens in recent years in policy terms, if not in outcomes then at least in perceptions among the voting public. In its election programme the CDU opened up this option by arguing for the medium- to long-term abolition of coal-fired power plants, one of the few hard requirements for The Greens for participation in government. The Greens have embraced the agenda set out by Mr Macron and would therefore not be a hindrance to euro zone reform efforts. Furthermore, this would allow Ms Merkel to sideline those forces within the CDU opposed to reform of the euro zone, which are sizeable and could in themselves threaten these efforts given the need for consensus in the German political system.
A coalition between the CDU, the FDP and The Greens (referred to as the Jamaica coalition in reference to the parties' colours matching the Jamaican flag) would come into view if the CDU and either The Greens or the FDP do not have a majority together, or if the majority is prohibitively small. Coalition negotiations would be significantly more difficult in such a case, as The Greens and the FDP are far apart on several issues-although such a coalition was recently agreed in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. This would also create a more complicated picture for euro zone reform, but given the balance within the coalition, we would expect an outcome closer to that of a CDU-Green coalition than one with the FDP.
The final realistic option would be for another grand coalition, which would be the third under Ms Merkel. Despite some rumblings from CDU and SPD officials that they do not want to embark on another grand coalition, the election programmes presented by both parties remain close enough that they could come to a credible coalition agreement. However, although the CDU would probably be amenable to continuing with the current coalition, this would make it difficult for the SPD to differentiate itself from the CDU, and we would expect the party to be hesitant for this reason. On the domestic front, such a coalition would probably lead to a continuation of the current bargaining between the two parties. As they are relatively well-aligned on EU and euro zone issues, this combination would guarantee strong German support for reforms of the euro zone.
Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
East-West political tensions in the region are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia is slowly dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place in at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and its breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Western countries have accused Russia of funding opposition parties in western Europe and employing cyber warfare against Western targets, as well as engaging in a propaganda war though media outlets that it controls in the West.
Tensions with Russia are unlikely to abate
Russia accuses the EU and the US of interfering in its sphere of influence, supporting the so-called "Colour Revolutions" in former Soviet space. Russia has accused NATO of going back on its post-cold war commitments by expanding relentlessly, first taking in central Europe and the Baltic republics, then Albania and Croatia in 2009 and, most recently, Montenegro in June 2017. Bosnia and Hercegovina, Macedonia and Georgia are now in the waiting room for admission. The Iraq War and Colour Revolutions fuelled Russian insecurity and convinced Russia that the US wanted "regime change" in the country, and possibly the break-up of the Russian Federation. In the face of such an existential threat, from the Kremlin's perspective any counter-measures are justified.
In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and has since been providing military support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. The EU imposed sanctions on Russia's energy, defence and banking sectors in July 2014 following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The sanctions are subject to regular renewal, requiring the approval of all 28 EU member states.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, seems likely to endure for several years. This will serve Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict will prevent any Ukrainian move towards the EU.
Russia will remain vehemently opposed to EU and NATO integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via a popular uprising similar to the Ukrainian Maidan revolution in 2014, would trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt a breakdown in inter-governmental relations has fallen sharply over the past year, as economic growth has picked up across the bloc. The ECB has successfully overcome objections in a number of countries-notably in Germany-to its use of unconventional policy in-struments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing (QE) has, up to now, not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform. This might change after the recent elections in France (and the UK), where there are calls for an easing of fiscal austerity.
The rise of anti-establishment political sentiment across much of the bloc has generated increased pressure for economic policymaking that is focused on national considerations rather than on the integrity of the euro zone, creating new centrifugal forces at a time when policymakers are already struggling to remedy the institutional shortcomings of the single currency. Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. This should ensure its survival in the short term, but the risk of a partial break-up in the medium term remains significant. We attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during our five-year forecast period.
The refugee relocation policy will be a bone of contention in the EU
The issue of refugee relocation is a focal point for existing tensions between integration-minded countries of west Europe and a core of central European countries. In September 2015 the European Council established a temporary scheme to relocate across the EU some of the Syrian refugees who had arrived in Italy and Greece, with the aim of sharing the burden of accommodating them. This was particularly controversial in central and eastern Europe, where governments characterised it as an attempt by western Europe to export the consequences of misguided foreign policies, and raised the prospect of terrorist attacks as a result of Islamist infiltration. Public opposition to the scheme has been high across the region.
Tension between Turkey and the EU will remain high
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. The sus-pension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Turkey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period.
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have pursued contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Since January 2017 tensions with Greece have escalated over Cyprus, disputed islands in the Aegean and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's application for the extradition of Turkish military officers who fled to Greece after the July 2016 coup attempt. We expect relations to remain tense, with sporadic flare-ups, but we do not expect an outbreak of conflict.
Political outlook: Hungary leads defiance of ECJ ruling on refugee relocations
The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, has said that his country will continue to challenge the EU's policy of sharing out some of the refugees that arrived in Greece and Italy during the migration crisis among the other EU members. Mr Szijjarto's comments followed remarks by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said in a newspaper interview on September 12th that it was "unacceptable" that Hungary was defying a judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which had ruled that the EU's policy on relocating refugees was legal and proportionate. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Hungary's nationalist government and its ally, Poland, to continue refusing to accept their quotas of refugees-in contrast to Slovakia, which has said that it will comply with the ruling. The fourth member of the Visegrad group of countries, the Czech Republic, is unlikely to adopt a clear response until after the upcoming election in October.
The ruling by the ECJ, pronounced on September 6th, came in response to a legal challenge to the EU's refugee relocation policy originally launched by Hungary and Slovakia in December 2015. The two countries had taken their case to the ECJ three months after the EU countries decided, by a majority vote, to redistribute 120,000 refugees-mostly from the Middle East-who were stuck in Greece and Italy, following a huge inflow of migrants. At the time of the EU's meeting in September 2015 four countries-the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia-voted against the decision to share out the refugees.
In dismissing Hungary and Slovakia's legal actions "in their entirety", the ECJ ruled that the decision by a qualified majority of EU countries was lawful, justified by the emergency posed by the unprecedentedly large inflow of displaced persons. The court also noted that the relative ineffectiveness of the relocation programme-only about 28,000 refugees have been moved from Greece and Italy in the past two years-was no reason to question the legality of the policy. European Commission officials have explained that, apart from the non-compliance of several east-central European states, another reason for the small number of relocations was that fewer people than anticipated in 2015 were actually eligible to benefit from the scheme.
ECJ judgment boosts European Commission's stance
The ECJ ruling will strengthen the hand of the Commission, which in June 2017 launched an infringement procedure against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland for their failure to comply with the relocation policy. According to the Commission, Hungary and Poland have not accepted any refugees, and the Czech Republic stopped doing so in August 2016.
Despite the ECJ's clear ruling, Hungary and Poland have both indicated that they will not change their stance on this issue. Both countries are led by nationalist, socially conservative governments, which claim that they are protecting the Christian identity of their countries against an inflow of mainly Muslim migrants. They also blame the recent flare-up in Islamist terrorist incidents in a number of west European countries on the affected states' more liberal asylum policies.
The Polish prime minister, Beata Szydlo, has said that the ECJ's judgment will not change her government's position on immigration. Her Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orban, has argued that although the ECJ's ruling needs to be "acknowledged", it applies only to the legality of the EU's policy and not to its implementation. For that reason, he has said that Hungary will maintain its policy of rejecting immigration, adding that the "real battle" against the EU's relocation programme is just beginning.
Slovakia will not follow Hungarian-Polish defiant stance
The defiant statements of the Hungarian and Polish governments are in stark contrast to Slovakia's more accommodating approach. Despite challenging the EU's relocation policy before the ECJ, Slovakia has been in compliance with the programme, taking in one more than the minimum number of refugees it is required to accept. It is therefore not one of the targets of the Commission's infringement procedure, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, has made it clear that his country will respect the ECJ's judgment.
Unlike Hungary and Poland, whose illiberal policies have prompted the Commission to launch a number of infringement procedures against them, Slovakia is well integrated into the EU's mainstream both politically and economically. It is the only member of the Visegrad group to be in the euro area; its government fully appreciates the benefits of EU membership; and it has no wish to be embroiled in disputes with Germany and other leading members of the EU.
The Czech Republic has adopted an approach somewhere between the two positions represented by Hungary and Poland on the one hand and Slovakia on the other. Czech leaders have said that they are not opposed to the relocation policy in principle, but that their country can continue to do more by providing financial assistance to the countries directly affected by the refugee problem. However, the Czech Republic could adopt a more co-operative approach after the election, scheduled for October 20th-21st, when the new government will be under less pressure to accommodate anti-migrant sentiment among the electorate.
Hungary and Poland are set to pay a price for non-compliance
If the defiance of the ECJ's ruling continues, the infringement procedure could result in fines being imposed on Hungary, Poland and possibly the Czech Republic (although only a handful more refugees would need to be taken in by the Czech Republic to meet the minimum criteria). However, the fines are likely to be relatively small in the context of the huge transfers that hese countries receive each year from the EU's structural and cohesion funds: they are, along with Romania, the largest net beneficiaries of EU assistance.
In the case of Hungary and Poland, the nationalist governments-which are in dispute with the Commission on a broad range of issues-believe that they have little to gain politically on their home ground by accepting the ECJ's ruling. This is especially so in the case of Hungary, where the ruling party, Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union (Fidesz), faces a challenge from the far-right, anti-immigrant Jobbik party ahead of the next election, due in April 2018. Given these domestic political concerns, both Hungary and Poland will continue to challenge EU institutions, bringing the two countries into greater conflict with Germany, France and other EU members that insist on burden sharing and respect for the rule of law.
Economic policy
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely heavily on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This created a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where The Economist Intelligence Unit expects further tightening over the forecast period (2017-21). Although we continue to expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in most countries, we now expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive during the forecast period.
Upheaval since the EU referendum drives a shift in UK's policy framework
The UK faces particularly stark economic policy challenges following its decision in a referendum in June 2016 to withdraw from the EU. Leaving the EU will represent a break with decades of settled policy and, depending on how negotiations with the remaining member states proceed, could require a major reconfiguration of the country's regional and global trade, investment and migration ties. In response to the referendum result, monetary policy in the UK was loosened further, but with consumer price inflation including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) rising to 2.7% in August 2017, well above the official 2% target of the Bank of England (BoE, the UK central bank), and sterling likely to remain under pressure, the balance of opinion within the monetary policy committee (MPC) has shifted. If the economy remains resilient to Brexit uncertainty in the coming months, there is a chance that a majority of MPC members will vote to reverse last year's move to cut the interest rate from 0.5%. However, if there is building evidence that the economy is slowing, the prospect of a rate increase will fade.
Importantly, the absence of a pick-up in wage growth reduces the chance that domestically driven price pressure will persist after exchange-rate effects have faded. Nevertheless, MPC members have demonstrated a reduced tolerance for above-target inflation and a desire to return interest rates to more "normal" levels, suggesting that the discussion on tightening will persist, especially as domestic demand picks up post-Brexit in 2019. We assume that the BoE will remain cautious in 2020, but as economic growth accelerates and inflation looks set to rise above target, we expect a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates in the first quarter of 2021, and another later in the year. The pace at which the BoE will tighten monetary policy will be gradual, and subdued wage growth will remain a downside risk to this forecast.
Another country in which the overall economic policy framework has been clouded by uncertainty is Turkey. Concerns about the policymaking implications of political instability deepened following the failed coup attempt in July 2016. However, since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency, household, business and investor sentiment has improved, and the lira and the economy have continued to recover. Given the healthy state of Turkey's public finances, the government is using the considerable room that it has to loosen fiscal policy and support the economy. Despite its concerns about growth, it has allowed the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy to counter severe pressure on the lira in early 2017 and a surge in inflation. With the US likely to raise interest rates further this year, we expect the central bank to have to keep monetary policy tight for some time, until inflationary pressures ease.
In Russia the fall in oil prices, which led to a significant contraction in real GDP and household consumption in 2015-16, has underlined the imperative for reforms to encourage investment and diversification away from commodity exports. Two competing centres of expertise-one under Aleksei Kudrin, a former minister of finance, and the other centred around the Stolypin Group, headed by Boris Titov, the business ombudsman-have put forward contrasting proposals for structural reforms. However, we do not expect significant reforms to be undertaken before the presidential election in 2018. We expect Vladimir Putin, the incumbent, to be re-elected and to continue prioritising social and political stability. We expect state involvement in the economy to remain substantial. Reform of the tax system and a gradual rise in the pension age appear likely. Institutional reform to strengthen the rule of law and protection for businesses looks much more difficult to achieve.

Data based on national definitions.
We expect fiscal consolidation to exert a much less powerful drag on growth over the forecast period compared with the preceding five years. Almost all European countries improved their fiscal positions in 2009-16, with the star performers being Iceland (by 26.1 percentage points of GDP), Greece (15.8), Ireland (13.1) and Lithuania (9.4). In the EU only Spain and France had deficits larger than the EU's 3% of GDP limit in 2016 (4.5% and 3.4% respectively). Although we expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis. The average EU government debt/GDP ratio was 85.6% at end-2016, but Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal had debt ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the euro zone for many years, although the cost of debt servicing has fallen dramatically owing to the exceptionally low interest rates that currently prevail across the bloc.
IMF and EU disagree on Greek government debt sustainability
A long-running disagreement between the IMF and some euro zone members on the sustainability of Greece's public debt and debt relief for Greece cast doubt over the country's ability to meet a July 2017 deadline for EUR7bn of bond repayments. However, a Eurogroup meeting on June 15th resulted in an agreement to disburse EUR8.5bn to Greece in two tranches in early July, following the conclusion of the second bail-out programme review. The IMF's managing director agreed in principle to support Greece with a stand-by programme, pending approval by the IMF board. However, there was no agreement on debt relief for Greece, with a discussion of the issue being deferred until after the end of the third bail-out programme, in August 2018. The government is hoping to establish a track record of borrowing on the international capital markets over the coming year and to be invited to join the quantitative easing (QE) programme of the European Central bank (ECB). These are preconditions for Greece avoiding having to sign a fourth bail-out programme. We are not convinced that these preconditions will be met.
The UK's vote to leave the EU has transformed the fiscal outlook
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016, but we forecast that the deficit will increase to 3.6% of GDP in 2017, from 3% of GDP last year, and will stay at around that level in 2018, as we expect the government to ease off from imposing further austerity policies. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, is likely to end the seven-year public-sector pay freeze for some state employees and announce new spending plans in the autumn budget, including extra spending on health and education. The government had already retreated (in November 2016) from previous plans to balance the budget by fiscal year 2019/20, and we do not expect this to be achieved by the end of the current parliament in 2022. Before the June 2017 snap election was called, Mr Hammond had aimed to return the budget to balance "as early as possible" in the next parliament. The target leaves some fiscal room for manoeuvre, although this would be undermined in the event that the economic fallout from Brexit is more severe than we expect.
Within the EU, over the past year a number of national governments have shown signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. In 2016 tensions between several member states and the European Commission, which enforces the EU's budgetary rules, came to a head. In early July 2016 the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should be fined for their failure to meet deficit targets in 2015, but the Commission ultimately stepped back from this position. The episode highlighted the growing tension between the strict fiscal rules agreed at the height of the crisis and the mounting political and economic arguments within member states for a greater degree of fiscal flexibility.
The fiscal position has deteriorated across the former Soviet Union
The steep fall in commodity prices and the sharp reduction in export demand and remittance inflows from Russia caused a significant deterioration in economic conditions across the former Soviet Union in 2015-16. This has contributed to a general deterioration in the fiscal picture across the region. The three major former Soviet oil exporters-Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia-were particularly hard hit and drew down reserves from their sovereign wealth funds to cover wider budget deficits and maintain investment as bank lending fell. All three countries have announced privatisation programmes to plug funding gaps, but we remain sceptical about the scope and pace of these plans. Russia completed the sale of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a major oil producer, in December 2016; however, the terms of the deal remain unclear and the state retains control of the company. Russia's financing challenges are acute, as international sanctions make it difficult for the country to increase foreign borrowing. However, despite international sanctions and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances, Russia placed two Eurobonds in mid-June 2017, which were oversubscribed.
In 2016 the deficit was the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of a stake in Rosneft. Without this the deficit would have exceeded 4% of GDP. The Russian Ministry of Finance has put forward ambitious austerity measures that, if implemented in full, would decrease spending by the equivalent of 2-3% of GDP in three years. We do not expect the ministry to succeed in holding expenditure steady in nominal terms in 2017-19 as it intends, owing in part to the presidential election in 2018. However, revenue planning has been set on the basis of a conservative oil price, and we therefore expect the budget deficit to shrink to 0.7% of GDP by 2021.
Weak institutional structures, high inflation and rapid currency depreciation have limited the ability of many countries in the region to respond to the economic slowdown with an expansive fiscal policy. Tajikistan, which has experienced a serious banking crisis, is seeking funding from the IMF, but is more likely to receive further bilateral support from China or Russia. The most notable exception in Central Asia is Kazakhstan, which is drawing on its substantial reserves to implement an ambitious counter-cyclical spending programme to offset the impact of falling household demand. The country avoided recession in 2016, recording real GDP growth of 0.9%. This is nevertheless significantly below the average growth rate of the past ten years.
Economic policy: Monetary policy and exchange rates
Interest rates (av; %) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
Euribor -0.3 -0.2 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3
US$ 3-month commercial paper rate 0.5 1.2 2.0 2.3 1.6 1.2
US 10-year government bond yield 1.8 2.4 2.6 2.8 1.8 1.5
10-year German government bond yield 0.2 0.4 0.7 0.9 1.5 2.1
In most of Europe monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative, and we expect this to remain the case throughout the forecast period. We expect the Bank of England to begin raising rates in 2021, although it is possible that a rate rate rise could come sooner than this. We expect the ECB to begin to taper its QE programme in 2018, but that its first rate increase will not take place until 2022.
We expect tapering of the ECB's QE programme to begin in 2018
The euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum and we expect an acceleration in growth to 2.1% this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a EUR60bn per month QE programme, which will run until the end of 2017. The ECB continues to take stock of this growth momentum, and has revealed that it may make an announcement on the future of its QE programme in October. We maintain our view that the bank will begin to wind down gradually, or "taper", the programme in 2018. Nevertheless, underlying price pressure remains relatively subdued, and downside risks to wage growth and the global economy during that year could yet slow the pace at which the ECB will reduce its monthly asset purchases. We forecast that the ECB will raise policy rates in 2022, although there is a high risk that this move will be brought forward to 2021.
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied to US$1.20:EUR1 as the region's economic recovery has strengthened, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation through 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, whereas the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020.
The BoE is likely to hold rates down until 2021
In 2016 the BoE took several steps to limit the financial and economic fallout from the Brexit vote. Since August 2016 the MPC has kept the main policy interest rate at 0.25%, the stock of government bond purchases at £435bn (US$581bn) and the stock of corporate bond purchases at £10bn. It also launched a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) for banks, the drawdown period for which will end after February 2018.
A rapid depreciation of the pound following the Brexit vote has exacerbated inflationary pressure, with the result that inflation has overshot its 2% target since February 2017. If the economy remains resilient to Brexit uncertainty in the coming months, there is a chance that a majority of MPC members will vote to reverse last year's move to cut the interest rate from 0.5%. However, if there is building evidence that the economy is slowing, the prospect of a rate increase will fade.
Importantly, the absence of a pick-up in wage growth reduces the chance that domestically driven price pressure will persist after exchange-rate effects have faded. Nevertheless, MPC members have demonstrated a reduced tolerance for above-target inflation and a desire to return interest rates to more "normal" levels, suggesting that the discussion on tightening will persist, especially as domestic demand picks up post-Brexit. We assume that the BoE will remain cautious in 2020, but as economic growth accelerates and inflation looks set to rise above target, we expect a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates in the first quarter of 2021, and another later in the year. The pace at which the BoE will tighten monetary policy will be gradual, and subdued wage growth will remain a downside risk to this forecast.
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote, reflecting investor unease about the implications of the vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow means that the value of the pound has remained volatile, albeit within a range of US$1.20-1.27:£1 until April 18th, when Theresa May, the prime minister, called the snap election. This initially boosted the value of the pound, but it fell back sharply in June in response to the shock result. By July it had started to strengthen again, reaching a post-referendum high of US$1.32:£1 in early August. The pound weakened again in response to data pointing to a softening in economic activity, but has since appreciated back to US$1.35:£1 by mid-September, after a stronger than expected inflation outturn and commentary from the BoE that revived expect-ations of tighter monetary policy. We forecast that sterling will depreciate against the US dollar and the euro on average in the next few years as the economy slows. However, we expect the pound to make a gradual recovery against the dollar in the final years of the forecast period.
Policy to be kept tight to support the Turkish lira and lower inflation
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates to revive economic activity has eased as the government has switched its attention to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates and balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. In mid-September 2017 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system was about 12%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking to normalise gradually its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and on a generally depreciating path against all major currencies since mid-2013, when the prospect of a gradual reduction in ultra-loose global liquidity and an eventual tightening of policy took shape. Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar, to an annual average of TL3.56:US$1 in 2017-a fall of about 15% compared with 2016. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL3.80:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Inflationary pressures have continued to weaken in Russia in 2017
In Russia inflation averaged 15.5% in 2015 as the sharp depreciation of the rouble in the fourth quarter of 2014 fed through into high import prices. A combination of weak demand and relatively tight monetary policy by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) led to significant disinflation in 2016; over the year as a whole inflation averaged 7%. Inflation fell from 5.4% year on year in December 2016 to 3.9% in July, meaning that the CBR is on track to achieve its end-of-year inflation target (currently set at 4%). Disinflation has been assisted by strong harvests last year and this year, as well as the relative strength of the rouble. We forecast that consumer price inflation will decline further in the second half of the year, to average 4.1% in 2017. External inflationary pressures are likely to be relatively low. Tax changes in 2019 are expected to push up inflation to 4.8% in that year. Overall, we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-target in 2018-21.
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of tightening by the Fed. However, we do not see significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of the record tourism season, have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2017.
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which have hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan both officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, the commitment of both countries to a free float would be seriously tested in the event of further oil volatility. We would expect the central banks of both countries to intervene-at least temporarily-in such a scenario to prevent sharp fluctuations in the currency and to maintain financial and monetary stability.
The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) had to grapple with a serious banking crisis in 2016 and struggled to restore confidence in the manat following the devaluation in December 2015. Ten banks failed in 2016, which further undermined confidence in the banking system and encouraged a flight to the US dollar. In early 2017 the CBA made substantial foreign-exchange reserves from the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ, the sovereign wealth fund) available to the CBA in an effort to restore confidence in the currency. This appears to have had a positive effect on sentiment.
Officially, the CBA is seeking to establish a free-floating currency and a monetary policy focused on inflation targeting. However, it does not currently have the monetary policy levers to control inflation effectively through open market operations. The financial sector is small, banking penetration rates are low, and the transmission mechanism between the cost of CBA lending and the money supply is weak. Dollarisation of the economy remains high, and oil prices will continue to play a dominant role in shaping inflation expectations, the exchange rate and the money supply.
Uzbekistan liberalises the som
In a significant move on September 5th the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) ended its long-running policy of administratively supporting the official exchange rate of the som on a crawling peg, allowing it to float freely. This move saw the official exchange rate converge to the black market rate of Som8,100:US$1, marking a depreciation of almost 50%. The president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, had announced in November 2016 that he would liberalise the exchange rate, allowing it to be determined by market forces. Since his announcement, the som's crawling peg was allowed to depreciate at a faster pace. Ahead of the currency liberalisation, the authorities implemented measures aimed at stemming the use of the black market. For example, following the issuing of a government decree, GM Uzbekistan, the country's largest automobile manufacturer, abandoned its practice of selling vehicles in foreign currency (primarily US dollars) in June. In addition to allowing the som's depreciation, Mr Mirziyoyev also sanctioned the relaxation of some stringent capital controls on foreign currency for businesses and individuals. Enterprises registered in Uzbekistan are now permitted to buy and sell currency for any purpose, including imports and the repatriation of profits (previously subject to controls). However, Uzbek citizens are still required to credit hard foreign currency to debit cards for spending abroad, leaving in place one significant capital control despite the currency reform. The Mirziyoyev administration has indicated that it will further reduce capital controls in the coming months, which will aid domestic competiveness. After depreciating in 2017-18, we expect broadly stable global commodity prices to bring about a modest appreciation against the US dollar in 2019-21.
Non-commodity exporters' currencies should stabilise from 2017
The currencies of most non-commodity exporters should continue to stabilise from 2017 onwards, as the main price adjustment from lower remittances from Russia and the weaker regional growth outlook has now taken place. However, the outlook remains uncertain. Weaker than forecast commodity prices or a return to fighting in eastern Ukraine could trigger another bout of currency volatility in Russia, which would be transmitted to most of the regional economies. Currency volatility over the past year has led to the increased dollarisation of many economies in the region, which will hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy and the ability of the central banks to stabilise inflation and output.

The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth in 2016 was firm, at 1.8%, albeit a modest slowdown from 2.2% growth in 2015. Activity weakened in the first quarter of 2017, with the quarterly increase in real GDP slowing to 0.2%. This largely reflected lower output in consumer-focused industries as rising inflation, stemming from a weaker pound, dampened domestic demand. Rising cost pressures and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU are likely to weigh more heavily on economic activity later this year. The Economist Intelligence Unit therefore expects a slowdown in the pace of economic growth, from 1.7% in 2017 to 1.3% in 2019. A deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU is likely to be phased in from 2019. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to rise to 2.1% by 2021.
The economic impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU on the wider regional economy could be substantial. In addition to the direct effect via trade and investment channels, over time the referendum result is also likely to compound centrifugal political and institutional dynamics in the EU and the euro zone. However, the short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe as a whole.
Europe's growth outlook improves as euro zone recovery broadens
The economic expansion in Europe is gaining momentum as the recovery that has been building since 2013 broadens and becomes more entrenched. We expect EU28 growth to accelerate this year, from 1.9% in 2016 to 2.1%, and to an average of 1.7% in 2018-21. The unemployment rate has declined steadily, to 7.7% in July 2017-its lowest level since late 2008-and there is little pressure on wages. This upswing mitigates the risk to the region's economic prospects from external factors, notably monetary policy tightening in the US and an expected slowdown in China. On the first of these, we expect the Fed, which raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in March, to increase the policy rate by another 100 basis points over the remainder of 2017 and in 2018. The election in November 2016 of Donald Trump as US president raised upside risks to economic growth in the country, and therefore increased the chance of a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Fed. However, we remained sceptical that the new administration would drive significantly faster US growth. In our view, therefore, the path of Fed tightening is likely to remain gradual. This should ease pressure on several countries in the wider region-notably Turkey, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Georgia and Croatia-that are more exposed than others to the effects of Fed tightening. We now expect a mild downturn in the US in 2020, but unprecedented Fed policies have inflated asset prices, and a turn in investor sentiment could harm consumer and business confidence.
The Chinese economy has continued to defy gravity, with official data showing growth slowing smoothly, despite persistent inefficiencies in the state sector and recessionary conditions in the industrial north-east. However, we think that the spectacular build-up of debt since the global financial crisis of 2008-09 is unsustainable and that a correction will occur in 2018, which, unless it is managed carefully by policymakers, will make a hard landing difficult to avoid. Such an outcome would have a severe global impact-far more than would have been the case in earlier decades.

Outlook for the euro zone will remain challenging
The euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum, and after average growth of 1.8% in 2015-16 we expect another healthy expansion of 2% this year, and annual average growth of 1.6% in 2018-21, with the risks weighted on the upside. In our view the economic recovery has further to run, partly because it is rooted in factors that will underpin sustainable demand, such as rising employment and household deleveraging. Furthermore, there remains significant slack in the euro zone economy that has yet to be absorbed. Nevertheless, the longer-term outlook for the single currency area will remain challenging. Demographic factors will begin to exert a more powerful drag on an increasing number of countries in the bloc. We do not expect policymakers to find a game-changing solution to remedy some of the euro zone's institutional shortcomings. In particular, they are unlikely to reform the bloc's fiscal policy framework. This means that tensions will persist between member states over targets for budget deficits, and it is almost inconceivable that the bloc's fiscal authorities will significantly ease the pressure on their monetary counterparts by pursuing an actively expansionary policy.
Much of central and eastern Europe also faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding in particular will see real GDP growth well above the EU average during the forecast period (2017-21). A deadline at the end of 2015 for fund drawdowns from the EU's 2007-13 fiscal period brought an end to a surge in investment spending. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to get under way in 2016, holding back activity last year, but there are now clear signs that funds are starting to flow and projects are beginning, which will lift economic growth rates during the forecast period. We expect that growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-will remain solid. The German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Within central and eastern Europe there are some divergences in terms of average growth rates and overall economic performance, and we expect these to persist. The Visegrad states-the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland-are set to record healthy growth rates in 2017-21, with low oil prices, significant trade integration with Germany, generally weighty and competitive external sectors (measured as exports relative to GDP), and a much smaller fiscal drag than previously supporting growth. Lower EU fund inflows, as projects financed under the 2014-20 fiscal period were slow to get started held back growth rates in 2016, but there is strong evidence to suggest that this has changed in 2017. Growth in the Czech Republic-the star performer in 2015, with 5.4% growth-slowed to 2.5% in 2016, but is forecast to reach 4.5% in 2017; and to average 2.5% per year in 2018-21. In Slovakia, real GDP growth slowed from 3.8% in 2015 to 3.3% in 2016; we expect this annual growth rate to be maintained on average over 2017-21. In Hungary, growth slowed to 1.9% in 2016, from 3.1% in 2015, but is expected to pick up to 3.7% this year and to average 2.6% per year in 2017-21. In Poland real GDP growth slowed from 3.8% in 2015 to 2.7% in 2016, reflecting a deterioration in policy and a rise in political risk. We expect real GDP to rebound to 3.7% in 2017 and to expand at an average annual rate of 3.3% in 2018-21.
Economic activity is picking up in south-east Europe
In south-east Europe the situation is generally improving after a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery, with growth rates in the region set to equal or even exceed those of the Visegrad states and the Baltics in 2017-18. We expect continued strong real GDP growth in the region's biggest economy, Romania, which grew by 4.8% in 2016. We expect growth of 5.3% this year and average annual growth of about 4% per year in 2018-21. However, rapid wage growth is driving a consumer boom that is sucking in imports and inflating the current-account deficit, and tax cuts have widened the fiscal deficit. Bulgaria will also maintain the momentum established in 2015, with growth in 2017 expected to be 3.6%. Over the medium term we expect real GDP growth to average 3% per year in Bulgaria. This sustained pick-up is driven by improved performance in the euro zone, robust export performance and increased expenditure on infrastructure projects, which received a boost from a surge in the inflow of EU funds.
Growth in the western Balkans and Baltics to accelerate; Visegrad to slow
We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans (Albania, BiH, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) of about 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018, up from an annual average of 2.7% in 2015-16. Growth in the three Baltic states is forecast to increase from an average of 1.9% per year in 2015-16 to an average 3.4% per year in 2017-18.
Economic activity in the western Balkans has picked up in the past two years, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices. In 2015-16 private investment and exports were the main drivers of growth in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, with private consumption remaining weak, pointing to a more balanced growth trajectory. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the global economic crisis in 2007-09, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some notable exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the region should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, slow progress on structural reforms, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. We do not think that the fallout from the Brexit vote will be unduly negative for the Balkans, whose slow progress towards EU membership is set to continue.
Croatia was the worst-performing economy in the former communist region in 2009-15, when annual growth averaged -1.6%. It emerged from six years of recession in 2015 with growth of 2.2%. Growth accelerated to 3% in 2016, driven by private consumption and investment, and benefiting from favourable base effects and cyclical factors, including low international oil prices and a record tourism season. In 2017-21 we forecast that real GDP will expand by an average of 2.6% per year-a significantly improved growth outlook compared with the years following the global financial crisis. Absorption of EU funds is improving. Nevertheless, the economy will only reach its 2008 level towards the end of the forecast period. Croatia is still at a relatively early stage in the reform process and is working off the excesses of the pre-crisis years. The need to pay down large public- and private-sector debt, a deteriorating demographic picture, poor competitiveness and a subdued external outlook will all contribute to the weak trend growth rate.
Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter during this period, government consumption also by nearly a quarter, house-hold consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, under way since 2016, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. After stagnating on average in 2016, we are fore-casting that real GDP will expand by 1% in 2017 and 1.8% per year in 2018-21.
With the threat of a bail-out breakdown and default in July avoided, we expect the pace of real GDP growth to pick up. Investment growth will return and household consumption will increase modestly, averaging 3.8% and 1.8% per year respectively in 2018-21. However, headwinds will persist in 2018 and beyond given the bail-out programme's emphasis on fiscal restraint and meeting ambitious primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year, as well as still high unemployment and limited lending growth. The decline in fixed investment since the start of the sovereign debt crisis will have a significant negative effect over the longer term, undermining the economy's ability to generate growth. Greece's external trade will be constrained by the continuation of the capital controls regime, as well as by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. After a strong second-half export performance in 2016, base effects will reverse this pattern in 2017. Over the medium term we expect tourism to support services export growth, but we forecast only modest growth of exports of goods and services, averaging 2% per year in 2017-21.
In Turkey domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook weighed on the economy in 2015-16, but relative stability following the April 2017 presidential reform referendum and fiscal stimulus measures will support solid economic growth of 5.5% in 2017 and an average of 4.5% per year in 2018-21. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey triggered by tighter than currently expected US monetary policy, although this is not our central forecast and we consider the probability of it happening to be low.
Russia's economy has moved into a recovery phase this year
Although low energy prices contributed to a modest recovery in EU growth in 2015, they triggered a deep recession across most of the former Soviet Union. Russia's real GDP growth, which is an important driver of economies in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, contracted by 2.8% in 2015. The recession persisted in 2016, as oil prices remained low and households and companies continued to deleverage. Household incomes declined in real terms for a second successive year. This was compounded by a contractionary fiscal policy. The weak banking sector and high political risk continued to depress investment. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan likewise faced the combined impact of contracting household and government expenditure and corporate deleveraging in 2016. Russian GDP fell by 0.2% last year. Kazakhstan's economy posted low growth of just 0.9%, and real GDP in Azerbaijan declined by 3.1%. The weakness of the Russian economy held down growth across the rest of the region, largely through low remittances and export demand.
Growth in Russia is expected to rebound moderately from 2017, driven by a recovery in commodity prices, which should encourage a strengthening of the rouble and household spending power. We expect the banking sector to start to stabilise, allowing for a modest recovery in investment. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2017. Risks are to the downside, as household consumption might be weaker than we currently forecast, and fiscal consolidation will continue to constrain public consumption and infrastructure spending. The external political environment remains uncertain, and a further upsurge in tensions with the West cannot be excluded. Moreover, oil prices could remain lower than currently forecast. In the medium term, structural constraints-the weak institutional environment, poor demographics and weak competition-will hold trend growth below 2% per year.
After the shocks of revolution and war real GDP contracted by 9.8% in Ukraine in 2015, before bouncing back by 2.3% in 2016, driven by a recovery in private consumption and investment. Subdued growth in Russia and restrictions on trade will limit the prospects for an export-led recovery. We forecast average annual growth of about 1.8% per year in 2017-21; our forecast assumes little progress in reforming the economy and stabilising the political system, but that there will not be a return to all-out war in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's fiscal position has improved but remains weak, and the potential for political instability to trigger an economic crisis is high.

The slump in global oil prices in late 2014 exacerbated a marked disinflationary trend in Europe, but helped to boost to the region's real economy in 2015, and to a limited extent in 2016, as households benefited from higher real earnings and businesses from lower input costs. Since late 2016 inflation has picked up, with base effects-notably those related to energy prices-providing much of the initial impetus in early 2017. As base effects have fallen out of the arithmetic, inflation has stabilised again. We expect it to average 1.7% in the EU28 this year, 1.5% in 2018 and an average of 1.8% per year in 2019-21.
In a number of specific instances across the region, very different inflationary patterns will be recorded-Turkey, for example, will struggle throughout the forecast period to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% target. Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high, as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. Assuming that the Central Bank of Turkey keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of ten categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into ten categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair, although patchy, have in most countries been under way for some time. Western Europe's score remains broadly stable, rising from 7.5 in the historical period to 7.6 in the forecast period, and eastern Europe's score moves up from 6.1 to 6.5 over the same timeframe. Across the region as a whole, the strongest ranking improvements are recorded by Croatia, Romania, Netherlands, Latvia, Cyprus, Spain and Sweden. By contrast, Turkey dropped by 12 places, Poland and Greece by six, Lithuania by four, and Germany and Hungary by three.
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets, and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Recent years have brought considerable improvement to the investment climate of central and eastern Europe. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even here. Factors such as a low-cost but well-qualified labour force, proximity to developed markets and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region during the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. In Russia the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. Low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to attempt to open up and diversify their economies. Ukraine has committed itself to an ambitious reform programme; however, its economic prospects will be harmed by disruption of trade and financial ties with Russia. Throughout the region the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power after the installation of a Constituent Assembly, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse (probably as foreign-exchange shortages culminate in debt default) or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling on to power if either Chinese or Russian finance helps the sovereign to avoid debt default, or should Mr Maduro be replaced by another member of the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to appease critics.
Inflation is likely to exceed 1,000% by end-2017 and 1,900% at end-2018. The risk of hyperinflation is rising as the government increasingly prints money for spending. We forecast that GDP will have contracted by a third between 2014-19. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consump-tion and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a recovery beginning in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to macro-economic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the government on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices and the economy will not return to growth until 2020 on the assumption of a new government that implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly hetero-dox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains last of the 12 countries covered, notwithstanding our assumption of improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Government's low approval ratings reduce the risk of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$7bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. The current-account deficit is estimated to have fallen from 4.3% of GDP in 2015 to 1.8% of GDP in 2016.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Political and social tension will remain high following a controversial vote on July 30th organised by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to establish a Constituent Assembly (ANC) with powers over all branches of government-including the opposition-controlled National Assembly-and a remit to write a new constitution. However, protests led by the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) opposition between April and July over the country's slide towards authoritarian government (the protests led to over 120 civilian deaths, mostly caused by the security forces) have died down as the MUD's focus shifts briefly to state governorship elections scheduled for October 15th. The scale of protests is likely to wax and wane in response to government measures to stifle democratic procedures, and those that are likely to persist will be from more violent and hardline youth groups of the opposition, known as "Resistencia".
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a change of government at some point in the 2017-21 forecast period. The government will resist holding the presidential election that is due in December 2018. It seems unconcerned about ever more damning criticism from the international community, including a threat of further US economic sanctions after the imposition of financial constraints in late August. Nonetheless, we do not expect Mr Maduro to manage to cling to power for the entire 2017-21 forecast period, on the basis that economic conditions seem set to deteriorate further, with Venezuela on the brink of hyperinflation and default, producing unsustainable pressure for a change of government. International oil prices are not expected to rise to such a level as to provide the foreign-exchange proceeds needed to ease chronic consumer goods shortages (Venezuela depends heavily on imports) and allow the government to meet external debt obligations falling due over the next 12-15 months. We therefore believe that a transition involving the opposition is likely in the medium term.
Given the highly volatile political situation, accurately forecasting when and how a transition of power will occur is challenging. We believe that there are two main triggers to a transfer of authority. The first scenario involves a traumatic descent into hyperinflation and default. In this scenario, Mr Maduro could manage to muddle through for the remainder of 2017 and much of 2018, running down reserves to meet external debt repayments, before ultimately being unable to avoid a debt default, perhaps in the context of the imposition of sanctions by the US on Venezuela oil imports. This would be likely to bring about Mr Maduro's downfall, as his allies in government and the military would be hit financially, and remaining popular support from his constituents (chiefly the poor and public-sector workers) would fade owing to heightened economic hardship as hand-outs dry up. Subsequently, a negotiated exit for key government figures would pave the way for the holding of fresh elections and an eventual victory for the MUD.
The second of the most likely potential transition scenarios involves a military coup, triggered by dissent among the ranks of the armed forces. Although successive PSUV governments have given increasing power to the generals and trained lower-ranking soldiers that share their ideology so as to cultivate pro-PSUV sentiment, unease among other stakeholders in the armed forces appears to be growing, judging by sporadic episodes of rebellion in recent months. In this scenario, a military government could replace the current PSUV leadership, although we would expect such a government to pave the way for free and fair elections relatively quickly.
Although it is not our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk that the PSUV will cling on to power. If, for example, Russia or China were to provide sufficient financial assistance to allow Venezuela to avoid default and boost oil output, or if oil prices were to rise significantly beyond our expectations, there is a possibility that the government would manage to withstand political pressure for elections and regime change. In another possible scenario, Mr Maduro could leave office but be replaced by another high-ranking PSUV official in an attempt to appease critics. However, no likely successor to Mr Maduro would appease opposition demands for elections and political transition, and tension would remain high.
Regardless of when and how political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. The broad, diverse opposition coalition will have to contend with huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party. Although we expect significant financial support from multilateral lending agencies, the risk of renewed political volatility will remain high, even under an opposition government.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
In both our transition scenarios we assume that elections will eventually be held and will be free and fair, ushering the MUD-led opposition into power. However, and as part of the government's efforts to cling to power in the meantime, we expect that the Maduro regime and the ANC will push back the schedule for the next presidential election, which is due in December 2018. The ANC began work in August and has a two-year mandate, so at the very least elections could be pushed back to August 2019, with approval from the politicised Supreme Court likely to be forthcoming. State governor elections are scheduled for October 15th and we expect the MUD to do well, but the centralisation of power means that the results will have little impact on overall government policy.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Following the installation of the ANC, Venezuela has become much more isolated diplomatically and is coming under increasing regional and international pressure. To date this has done little to weaken the government's grip on power, but US sanctions could prove significant. In August the US government prohibited fresh US-dollar-denominated bond issuance and bond trading between the Venezuelan government and US institutions-complicating already difficult financing conditions. There is a growing likelihood of other economic measures such as cuts in US exports of distillates that Venezuela needs for its oil exports, lifting costs and hence reducing foreign-exchange proceeds, before ultimately cutting US purchases of Venezuelan oil, a move that would cripple the economy. Mercosur, a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, has suspended Venezuela indefinitely owing to "violations to the constitutional order", and a group of major countries in the region has denounced the regime and said that they will not recognise laws passed by the new ANC. The Vatican, which has in the past tried to mediate between the Venezuelan government and opposition, has also criticised the ANC. The government is participating in a new round of internationally mediated negotiations with the opposition, brokered by the former Spanish prime minister, José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero (2004-11). A return to negotiations could potentially provide a path to fresh elections and a political transition, but huge obstacles remain.
A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with China (a key creditor) and Russia, whose state oil company, Rosneft, is active in Venezuela. Financial assistance from these countries could help the Maduro regime to survive for longer by providing much-needed external financing in exchange for lucrative oil contracts for Rosneft.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without significant policy adjustments. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017-18 than it has done so far. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or technically incapable of adjusting policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention-ism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA, the state-oil company. However, given an extremely thin reserves cushion (less than $10bn in September), we have now factored into our forecasts the likelihood of a debt default in 2018, which would have dramatic consequences in the form of lower oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
In our baseline scenario, we expect the opposition to hold power by 2019, ushering in much-needed, market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.5% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.7% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply (M2) rose by around 450% year on year in August, the highest rate on record. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Our forecasts now assume that Venezuela will default on its external debt at some stage in 2018. This will be followed by a restructuring process with external creditors under an MUD-led opposition government.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. Our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government in 2019 also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that we project further contractions in real GDP in 2017-19. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a real GDP decline of a third in 2014-19.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2017-18, reflecting the effect of soaring inflation on real wages, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in invest-ment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 33.7% in August, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January---August to 366%. Assuming that price pressures remain high, we expect inflation to exceed 1,000% by year-end and over 1,900% by the end of 2018 (this is an upwards revision of the forecast included in our previous monthly report for Venezuela). We continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, under the assumption of a recovery in oil output and corrective economic policies under a MUD-led government. However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
As the central government has no apparent expectations of an increase in inflows of US dollars to the country, and using financial sanctions imposed by the US in late August as an excuse, Mr Maduro also announced the implementation of a "basket of currencies" (such as the rupee, ruble, yuan and euro) for international transactions to avoid the use of the US dollar. The basket of currencies will include currencies that are not easily convertible, meaning that this will probably make external transactions even more complicated. Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2017-18, but the exchange rate will still be extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom for private-sector operations (but where demand for US dollars vastly outstrips supply). After the government unexpectedly announced a suspension of the Dicom system in early September, the black-market rate shot up above BsF22,000:US$1.
We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued decline in oil output. A sharp fall in oil output in 2019 will lift the current-account deficit. In 2020-21 a recovery in oil output will help to offset a rise in imports after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021 reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Abstract: In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity. Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. 2012a 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016b 2017c 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 26.1 27.0 28.8 29.7 30.5 31.3 32.1 32.9 33.6 34.2 Labour force (% change) 2.1 3.5 6.4 3.1 3.0 2.5 2.7 2.2 2.3 1.8 Employment (m) 23.9 24.6 25.9 26.6 27.2 27.8 28.8 29.7 30.4 31.0 Employment (% change) 2.9 2.8 5.4 2.7 2.2 2.2 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 Unemployment (m) 2.2 2.4 2.9 3.0 3.3 3.5 3.4 3.2 3.2 3.2 Unemployment rate (%) 8.5 9.1 10.0 10.3 10.9 11.1 10.4 9.7 9.6 9.4 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 8.9 7.5 8.9 7.7 7.8a 10.6 8.9 6.6 5.7 5.2 Consumer prices (year-end)d 6.3 7.5 8.3 8.9 8.5a 9.3 8.7 6.0 5.3 5.0 Producer prices (av) 6.1 4.5 10.2 5.3 4.3a 13.3 4.6 8.5 7.5 5.5 GDP deflator (av) 7.4 6.3 7.4 7.8 8.1a 8.0 7.9 7.1 6.0 5.7 Private consumption deflator (av) 7.8 6.1 7.7 7.7 6.6a 10.1 8.3 8.3 6.8 6.3 Government consumption deflator (av) 9.3 6.0 9.4 8.4 8.9a 9.6 8.9 6.6 5.7 5.2 Fixed investment deflator (av) 6.6 5.8 9.0 7.5 7.6a 6.0 5.5 5.0 5.0 5.0 Average nominal wages 15.6b 14.4b 15.5b 13.7b 15.9 12.9 12.0 11.0 10.0 10.0 Average real wages 6.1b 6.5b 6.1b 5.6b 7.5 2.1 2.9 4.1 4.0 4.5 Unit labour costs (TL-based; av)e 15.9b 10.9b 18.2b 12.6b 17.3 11.9 13.0 12.1 10.6 9.9 Unit labour costs (US$-based)e 8.1b 4.7b 2.8b -9.4b 5.6 -4.9 15.1 8.3 7.6 7.5 Labour costs per hour (TL)e 7.5b 8.6b 10.0b 11.3b 13.1 14.8 16.6 18.4 20.3 22.3 Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.2b 4.5b 4.5b 4.2b 4.3 4.2 4.8 5.1 5.5 5.9 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Seasonally adjusted. e Manufacturing only: public and private sectors.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parlia-mentary system of government with an executive presidency. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud, however, have deepened social and political divisions.
The presidential reform, which is due to come into effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule.
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. In response to the failed coup in 2016 the government has carried out an extensive purge of public-sector personnel, which risks undermining institutional capacity.
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by the domestic political goals of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies.
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, in part owing to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup but also because of faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the final quarter of 2016, supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth to accelerate to 5.5% in 2017 and to an average of 4.5% in 2018-21.
Inflation is expected to average 10.6% in 2017 following a sharp depreciation of the lira due to the political turmoil in the country at the end of 2016. The lira will recover some ground in 2017-18 (on average), although we expect it to depre-ciate mildly against the US dollar in 2019-21. In response, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to keep a tight monetary policy stance through 2018.
We expect the current account to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2017-21, but the country's global ranking falls by 12 places, to 58th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, domestic political tension has created uncertainty about the direction of policy. Important shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion. The failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey cannot be ruled out.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit maintains its negative medium-term political outlook. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened the social and political divisions. The "justice march" from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul, headed by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), ended peacefully on July 9th, but further protests are likely, keeping high the risk of clashes between protesters and pro-government supporters or a government clampdown. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incum-bent president and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have continued to tighten their grip on power. The state of emergency law introduced after the failed coup has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis. We expect it remain in place for the foresee-able future, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and silence government critics. More than 100,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk remains high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given the popularity of the president, and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round, with just over 50% of the vote, against a joint candidate presented by the CHP and the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties will consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the consti-tutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's inter-national relations with its traditional Western allies.
Having deployed armed forces to back rebel groups in Syria to fight IS and prevent the expansion of territory held by US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds, Turkey risks becoming embroiled in the conflict. Tensions and the risk of confrontation between Turkey and US-backed forces could escalate once IS is defeated. The US administration appears unlikely to grant Turkey's request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey on charges of masterminding the failed coup. Even if the AKP government provides evidence of his role in the coup that would stand up in a US court, there would be a strong chance that his extradition would be rejected on the grounds that he might not get a fair trial in Turkey.
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. Although neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally, there is a growing probability that this will occur in 2017-21. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. The suspension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Turkey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances; its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector; and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows to Turkey during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016 and early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy in November 2016 after a prolonged period of loosening. The lira has recovered all the ground that it lost in January 2017, but it remains vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, as illustrated by a short, sharp drop in value against the US dollar in the first week of July, probably prompted by expectations of balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). If the lira depreciates sharply again, an abrupt tightening of policy might be necessary, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery. However, this is not our baseline scenario, as we currently expect US monetary policy to be tightened only gradually in the remainder of 2017-18.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges have blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit- and public debt-to-GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.3% in 2021. Although the government debt/GDP ratio has edged up slightly, to 29.2% in 2016, we expect it to drop gradually, to 27% in 2017-21. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates in order to revive economic activity has eased as the government has switched its attention to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance-sheet tapering. To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. In mid-September 2017 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system was about 12%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking to normalise gradually its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3.3% in 2016, in part owing to the disruption to the economy caused by the failed coup last July, but also faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the final quarter of last year, and we expect growth to accelerate to 5.5% in 2017 and an average of 4.5% in 2018-21. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. There are downside risks to this forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government in the next few years does not lead to further political instability, deterring foreign capital flows into the Turkish economy.
We expect a moderate improvement in confidence, a recovery in employ-ment growth and government incentives for the purchase of certain household durable goods (in the short term, at least until September 2017) to support household spending. We forecast average real private consumption growth of 3.8% in 2017-21, from 3.7% in 2016.
In 2016 government spending expanded by 9.7%. We expect it to increase by nearly 7% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate, but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to hold down fixed investment growth at about 5% per year in 2017-18, as a more cautious approach by businesses will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast a gradual acceleration to annual growth of 6% by 2021, assuming that domestic political tensions ease after the elections.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey, the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-21. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourism sector. Our expectation is that a slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disin-flationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect the pass-through effects of past currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2021. There are upside risks to our forecast.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar, to an annual average of TL3.56:US$1 in 2017-a fall of about 15% compared with 2016. In 2018 we forecast a small appreciation, to an average of TL3.49:US$1. In 2019-21 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating mildly in nominal terms, to an average of TL3.80:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
We expect the current account to widen moderately and remain large enough, at a forecast average of 4% of GDP per year in 2017-21, to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanc-tions will boost Turkey's main exports, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in 2017, but the sector is likely to take several years to recover to its 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.
