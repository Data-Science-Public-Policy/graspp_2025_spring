Full text: - The centre-right New Democracy (ND) government, led by the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, returned to power for a second term after the June 2023 election. Another four-year term of stable single-party government will provide policy continuity, with the government building on a track record of economic reform that has helped to restore investor confidence in Greece. EIU expects the government to remain in power until the next general election in 2027. ND has a comfortable parliamentary majority, and the main opposition parties are weak and fragmented. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement-Movement for Change (Pasok-Kinal), a coalition comprising Pasok and other small centre-left parties, has not yet managed to supplant Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza) as the second party. Both opposition parties will need charismatic leadership, and more compelling policy alternatives, if they are to mount a serious challenge to ND by the next election.

- The marked improvement in the business environment over the past five years will continue in 2024-28. Reforms undertaken since the election in July 2019 of a pro-business centre-right government have restored investor confidence and underpinned an economic recovery. Owing to progress across many categories, Greece's score rises from 5.84 in the historical period (2019-23) to 7.24 in the forecast period (2024-28), pushing up its global ranking by 21 places to 33rd, the biggest improvement of any country. Greece also improves its regional ranking, rising from bottom-placed 18th in 2019-23 to 14th.

- The Greek economy rebounded strongly from the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 and has proved resilient in the face of the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We forecast a pick-up in real GDP growth in 2024 to 2.8% and a further acceleration in output to an annual average of 3.2% in 2025-28 as the energy and inflation crisis eases and the Greek economy benefits from strong investment growth, supported by generous EU funds. Following the protracted crisis of the 2010s, the economy has scope for considerable catch-up growth more akin to an emerging economy, and we expect faster growth rates than the euro zone average. The main risks to this forecast are a potential widening of the conflict in the Middle East and slower growth among Greece's trading partners in the EU than expected.

- According to UN projections, the population will decline by an average of 0.4% per year in 2024-28. At the same time, life expectancy is increasing, and so is the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and above to the working-age population). The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of demographic ageing. The proportion of people aged over 64 is forecast to rise from an estimated 23.1% in 2023 to 25% in 2028. Population ageing will prove to be a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.

- GDP per head (at market exchange rates) is forecast to rise to US$31,868 by 2028, from a low of US17,960 during the pandemic of 2020, reflecting a robust recovery in GDP from a low base, but also a shrinking population. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had negative spillovers but have also spurred positive changes, for example by accelerating digitalisation and the energy transition. The recovery of the tourism industry and the associated real estate sector will also revive market opportunities.

Growth of real GDP per head 3.4 2.9 3.0
Growth of real GDP 3.0 2.4 2.5

- We expect real GDP to grow at 3% per year on average in 2024-30 (3.4% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 2.4% (2.9% per head). Labour productivity growth will average a robust 3.2% over the long-term forecast period (2024-50). These impressive growth rates reflect catch-up growth in Greece, after the previous decade-long period of crisis and negative growth after 2010. However, the working-age population and labour force will shrink and will be a constraint, preventing faster catch-up growth.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's elevated public debt put the country's EMU membership into question, but that risk has receded.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. The 2010 crisis shook the traditional party system as voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after its return to democracy in the mid-1970s-namely New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis. The result was political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza), which was in power in 2015-19, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn. However, ND returned to power in July 2019 and formed a new government after winning the election in June 2023.
Policy issues: Greece exited its third economic adjustment programme in August 2018, but will be subject to monitoring by its euro zone creditors for decades. In the short term the government's main focus will be on implementing its reform programme to maximise the use of ample grants and loans under the EU recovery fund, and responding to the economic challenges created by the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East. In the medium to long term, the main challenges will be putting Greece's public finances on a sustainable footing, diversifying economic activity to reduce overdependence on tourism, improving the business environment, reviving the privatisation programme and reducing still-high levels of non-performing loans.
Taxation: The tax rate is 22% on corporate profits and 5% on distributed dividends. The top personal income-tax rate is 45%. The standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 24%, but temporary cuts and payment deferrals have applied since the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
Foreign trade: In 2023 goods exports (fob) totalled US$53.5bn and imports (fob) amounted to US$88.5bn. The current account registered a deficit of US$15.3bn, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Following two elections in May and June 2023, the centre-right New Democracy (ND) party, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, returned to office for a second consecutive term with a majority of 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The 142 seats held by opposition MPs are distributed as follows as at mid-April 2024: Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza) 36; Panhellenic Socialist Movement-Movement for Change (Pasok-Kinal) 31; Communist Party of Greece (KKE) 21; Greek Solution (12); New Left (formed in December 2023 by MPs who defected from Syriza) 11. The remaining 31 seats are held by two far-right parties (17), independents (eight) and the leftist Course of Freedom (six). In early 2025 parliament will elect the president, but the role is without executive powers.

Political outlook: Political stability EIU expects the ruling centre-right ND), led by the prime minister, Mr Mitsotakis, to dominate the political scene in 2024-28, following its emphatic election win in June 2023. ND has a comfortable majority, with 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament, and continues to lead in opinion polls by a wide margin. The disarray of the main opposition party, Syriza, which has split, has helped to strengthen ND's position. Pasok-Kinal, a coalition comprising Pasok and other small centre-left parties, has not yet managed to supplant Syriza as the second party. Both opposition parties will need charismatic leadership and more compelling policy alternatives if they are to mount a serious challenge to ND by the next election.
We expect ND to continue with its pro-business agenda and implement many of the reforms it has promised to modernise the economy. Mr Mitsotakis's cabinet comprises mainly ministers with proven track records. However, the government will continue to face resistance from vested interests and strong political opposition to some of its policies. As elsewhere in Europe, there have been widespread protests by farmers calling for greater government support, but the plight of Greek farmers has been exacerbated by the devastating floods of 2023. The farmers are asking for tax breaks and subsidies to lower costs, especially for energy usage, and the government appears ready to negotiate. Meanwhile, it has faced down protests by students and leftists who oppose new legislation allowing foreign universities to establish campuses in Greece. Parliament approved the education reform bill in March, ending a monopoly of state institutions in tertiary education that had been enshrined in the constitution.
The government is planning new legislation aimed at reducing the backlog of cases in Greece's highest administrative court, a problem which is inhibiting the investment climate and presenting barriers to urban and environmental planning. High on the agenda also are reforms to address policy and planning failures exposed by the wildfires and floods in 2023. The government is also under pressure to address the infrastructure problems highlighted by the Tempi train crash in February 2023. It must also accelerate implementation of the reforms contained in Greece's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), and tighten fiscal policy to reduce the country's high level of public debt.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Greece scores poorly in relation to other developed economies for political and institutional effectiveness, as a result of the high levels of corruption, patronage and inefficiency affecting the government and the legal system. However, we expect an improvement on all counts during the forecast period, driven by a reform-minded government with a two-term mandate. Under Greece's financial assistance package, which expired in August 2018, the authorities committed to implementing far-reaching reforms of the public administration, judiciary and society more broadly. Since 2019 the ND government has provided fresh momentum to the reform process, enacting measures intended to improve government effectiveness, including by addressing major shortcomings in the public administration and the judiciary.
The establishment of a modern state and public administration was one of the four pillars of the reform agenda under the bail-out programme and the post-bail-out enhanced surveillance regime overseen by Greece's euro zone creditors in 2015-22. The main priorities have been to control the size and cost of the public sector and at the same time increase the efficiency of the public administration in the delivery of essential public goods and services. Reforms have been designed aimed at strengthening the institutional and operational independence of major institutions, such as revenue administration and the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), as well as improving the efficiency of the judicial system and tackling corruption.
Action to strengthen the public-sector recruitment system is continuing Efforts to reduce the size of the public administration have borne fruit, with the total number of civil servants having fallen from 900,000 in December 2018 to 820,000 at the end of 2021 (600,000 permanent and 220,000 temporary staff). The number of permanent staff had fallen below 566,000 by February 2022, and there has also been some success in converting temporary positions into permanent positions. To increase its control over the hiring of temporary staff, the ND government reduced the number of exceptions used to bypass temporary staff hiring procedures. At the same time, the government strengthened the efficiency of the civil service recruitment system and reduced political interference by increasing the capacity of the Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection (ASEP), the authority responsible for civil service recruitment. The measures include stronger competition procedures, scoring classification procedures, temporary staff hiring procedures and the reorganisation of ASEP.
There has been uneven progress in the depoliticisation of the public administration. This was supposed to be accomplished through renewal of the top management and the implementation of new selection procedures for all levels of senior management, including the replacement of political appointees. There has been some progress in increasing the efficiency of the judicial system, which is needed to enhance the business environment and revive investment. However, Greece's judicial system remains burdened by an excessive backlog of cases, especially tax cases (appealing tax decisions can take up to 12 years). The sector is subject to frequent strikes by the courts and the Bar Association. The government is planning to bring forward new legislation in the first half of 2024 to reduce the backlog of cases at the Council of State, Greece's top administrative court, by allowing more junior judges to participate in case-processing. Reducing the backlog would improve the investment outlook and reduce obstacles to urban planning.
In terms of the anti-corruption agenda, the ND government has made progress in implementing the relevant action plan, including through the adoption of recommendations by the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). The authorities have repeatedly amended the legal framework for the financing of political parties and have brought it into line with European best practice.
The government has accelerated digitalisation and technological adoption across many sectors, including the public administration, education and training, health, tourism, justice, employment, and culture. An end-to-end IT tax collection system is now fully operational, and there is enhanced functionality of the e-filing platform in administrative courts. Cadastral mapping has made good progress and is almost completed. Greece is committed under its national action plan to improving the data held by the Hellenic Cadastre. The aim is to improve the quality and increase the quantity of data in relation to land transactions, as well as providing complete public datasets of georeferenced postal addresses and toponyms.
We expect Greece to continue to lag most of its peers in the EU in institutional capacity and reform of the public administration and judiciary. The need to improve government effectiveness to meet the governance requirements for access to EU recovery funds could spur a more rapid improvement.
Political outlook: Election watch The next parliamentary election is not until 2027, but Mr Mitsotakis and his party's popularity will be tested at the European Parliament elections on June 9th 2024. ND has extended its lead in recent opinion surveys, polling about 18 percentage points above Syriza, which has regained second place from the centre-left Pasok-Kinal two months ahead of the elections. We expect the ruling party to perform well in June.
In the June 2023 general election ND won an emphatic victory, with 40.6% of the vote, confirming a continued shift in Greek politics to the centre from the radical left and the far right. Seven other parties passed the 3% threshold to enter parliament, but their share of the vote lagged far behind. Syriza polled 17.8%, making it the weakest main opposition party since Greece restored democracy in 1974. It has since been beset by internal problems and has slipped further in the polls to about 15%. It is likely to face an increasing challenge from the other left-of-centre party, Pasok-Kinal, which is polling at about 13-14%, according to recent polls. In early 2025 parliament will elect the president, but the role is without executive powers.
Political outlook: International relations Greece has strengthened its commitment to Euro-Atlantic organisations. The US sees Greece as a linchpin of stability in the Balkans, Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean regions, and the two countries are developing a strategic partnership encompassing energy and security. Greece has strongly supported the EU and US response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which involves the imposition of far-reaching sanctions. Greece, which has a strategic partnership with Israel and traditionally good relations with Arab countries, has put itself forward as a mediator in the Middle East conflict, balancing support for Israel with organising humanitarian relief for Palestinians in Gaza.
Bilateral relations between Greece and Turkey improved during 2023, and the two countries have embarked on negotiations with the aim of reaching agreement on long-standing disputes, including over maritime borders, Cyprus and other matters. Despite the positive climate and strong political will on both sides, substantial obstacles remain, and agreement on the most contentious issues is likely to remain out of reach.

Overview: Economic reforms and competent management contributed to the re-election in June 2023 of a pro-business government led by New Democracy (ND). EIU's business environment score for Greece rises from 5.84 in the historical period (2019-23) to 7.24 in the forecast period (2024-28), resulting in a 21-place improvement in the country's global ranking, to 33rd (out of 82), the biggest improvement of any country. Greece's economic recovery has proved resilient, and a combination of political stability, a pro-business government, an improving investment climate and a gradually improving global macroeconomic backdrop will further strengthen the operating environment.
Strengths: The improvements are broad-based. Many reflect the impact of the government's overhaul of the public administration since 2019 and a new momentum in digitalisation, as well as generous state support for households and businesses hit by the pandemic and the fallout from the war in Ukraine, reform of the banking system to reduce non-performing loans, and consistent efforts to attract foreign investment.
Weaknesses: The public sector is inefficient, and the private sector is hampered by red tape. Demographic trends are not conducive to growth. The labour market needs further reform. Greece will need to find new sources of financing after the expiry of the EU's post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) in 2026. The country is a laggard in technological readiness.
What to watch
- The pro-business government currently appears unassailable. It may prove difficult to sustain reform momentum in the face of a weak political opposition.
- The country's bold move to open up tertiary education may help to stem education-related migration and remedy sectoral skills shortages.

Business environment outlook: Greece's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The pro-business New Democracy government refocuses its efforts to revive privatisation after elections in 2023. A newly created "project readiness" unit will start to deliver results.
2026-28: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Cutting bureaucracy will be a focus. Adoption of new incentives, including tax incentives, to encourage foreign investment. A further boost comes from EU recovery-fund-related reforms and renewed investor confidence.
2026-28: Fast-track legislation, together with inflows of EU funds, helps to drive an investment recovery in strategic sectors such as energy, tourism, transport, communications and healthcare.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Middle East conflict causes trade disruption, contributing to higher global shipping costs, but from low levels.
2026-28: The risk of Greece leaving the euro zone recedes further as the country's public debt profile improves, but debt will still be high at the end of the forecast period. Debt repayments step up from 2026 onwards.
Taxes 2024-25: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base while lowering rates. The government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Efforts are under way to simplify both tax structure and tax filing.
2026-28: Slow progress in cutting corporate tax and value-added tax (VAT) rates. Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing 2024-25: A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for most debtors. Liquidity is likely to remain tight as interest rates stay high. Non-performing loans (NPLs) could start to rise again.
2026-28: Still-high NPL levels continue to hamper lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market 2024-25: Unemployment eases but remains high by international standards. Some sectors such as shipping and tech may suffer shortages.
2026-28: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for young people, raise employment but create few productive jobs. Reforms in higher education start to have a positive impact.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Energy infrastructure becomes increasingly important as part of the green transition and as Greece aims to become a supply hub for the Balkans. A floating storage and regasification unit in Alexandroupolis will start operating in 2024.
2026-28: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness 2024-25: High-speed internet rollout proceeds at a slow pace. Use of electronic payments increases. Digitalisation of the public administration continues.
2026-28: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard in tech readiness.

Overview: Greece's score and global ranking for the macroeconomic environment are relatively low, but both improve in the forecast period. The country's large public debt, a legacy of the bailout era of 2010-19, and significant current-account deficit will continue to hold back improvement in 2024-28. Greece's external creditors have praised the government's efforts to keep reform implementation on track, despite the difficult circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The country has consequently regained investment-grade status from most international rating agencies.
Strengths: Greece has made good progress in improving the quality of policymaking and the institutional underpinnings for sound macroeconomic policies. The country exited an enhanced surveillance regime in mid-2022, but will remain under surveillance by its euro zone creditors, which will provide an external reform anchor. Greece delivered a primary surplus of an estimated 1.1% of GDP in 2023; we expect this to reach 3% of GDP by 2028.
Weaknesses: The main macroeconomic challenge will be adopting and sustaining the policies and reforms that will spur growth over the medium and long term. The economy presents a mixed picture at the start of 2024, after three years of rapid growth that were in part an automatic rebound from the pandemic-related collapse of 2020. The public sector is still inefficient and the private sector hampered by red tape; demographic trends are not conducive to growth; and the labour market requires further reform. The ND government will need to maintain the reform momentum of recent years during its second term and make good use of large potential EU funds.
What to watch
- Greece needs to meet primary budget surplus targets set by its euro zone creditors over a long time horizon. Despite a recent return to investment-grade status, a prolonged tight monetary environment would be a short-term risk. Over the longer term, delivering annual primary surplus targets of 3% of GDP will be challenging given the inevitability of periodic economic downturns.
- Greece's refinancing needs will increase sharply after 2025. Governments will have to operate tight control of the public finances and undertake structural economic reforms to enhance growth, with the aim of drastically reducing the public debt in the coming decades. The stock of public debt was the highest in the euro zone (as a share of GDP) at 206.4% in 2020, but sound fiscal policies and robust nominal GDP growth should bring this down to below 127% by 2028.

Overview: Greece retains a large public sector, and so the key policy priority has been the privatisation of state-owned companies. Yet progress has been uneven, largely because of weak implementation. Greece managed to raise EUR8.7bn in more than a decade (2011-2023) of effort, which included political turmoil, a pandemic and a public-sector debt haircut. However, it has started 2024 with a strong showing, listing a 30% stake in the Athens International Airport, which raised EUR800m. The government is aiming to achieve its most ambitious privatisation budget to date, at EUR5.8bn for 2024.
Strengths: About 80% of the 2024 budgeted privatisation revenue is made up of two projects. They are the Egnatia highway (EUR1.4bn) and the Attica Ring Road (EUR3.3bn). Both of these have already been awarded and are awaiting regulatory approval, which makes it all but certain that Greece will enjoy a record year in terms of privatisation revenue. In addition to the progress of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), which is responsible for the country's privatisation programme, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), which was tasked with recapitalising the banks during the financial crisis, has started to divest its stakes. It sold the small minorities it held in two of the four systemic banks in late 2023, as well as a 22% stake in the National Bank of Greece, retaining an 18.4% stake. It also sold a 27% stake in Piraeus, the fourth systemic bank, in March 2024.
Weaknesses: Laws put in place in 2011 and 2012 abolished restrictive practices in more than 150 professions, but they have not been fully applied. Implementation of the law has in many cases been left to professional groups, which have used their influence to maintain restrictive practices. Legislation has been passed to open network industries, but it is ponderous, and implementation will be slow.
What to watch
- The sale of the remaining 18.4% stake owned by the HFSF in the National Bank of Greece, as well as the implementation of the privatisation agreements of the Attica Ring Road and the Egnatia highway, are developments to watch. Implementation risk has dogged the programme repeatedly in the past, so delays should be expected.
- The sale of a host of smaller projects consisting of second-tier ports, marinas, resorts and wellness springs is planned. These are not of a magnitude to affect the national economy, but if successful could reinvigorate local economies. Some come with significant investment commitments.

Overview: The ND government has adopted a foreign direct investment (FDI) policy aimed at reversing a process of disinvestment that had been in train since 2010. However, improving Greece's attractiveness as a location for FDI will be challenging. Deterrents include complex and unevenly enforced legislation, frequent changes in tax laws and obstructive bureaucracy. The government is scaling up efforts to mitigate these through the digitalisation of procedures, funded in part through the RRF.
Strengths: Successive governments have sought to speed up company registration, fast-track investment and simplify export rules. Most of the progress was achieved during the pandemic, which was conducive to digitalisation of procedures and curbed the resistance of unions, and momentum has been sustained. The fast-track legislation covers investments that are deemed strategic. The process provides for approval in one month and facilitation of licensing and permitting applications (against payment of fees) within two months by the Ministry of Development and Investment's Enterprise Greece agency. Some 53 projects had been registered by March 2024, including iconic investments by Pfizer and Microsoft.
Weaknesses: The investment incentives law involves the Hellenic Development Bank (HDB). The HDB operates in conjunction with commercial banks to provide financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, given Greek banks' high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), available funding is limited. HDB financing is supplemented by the development ministry with EU-led community support framework funding, as well as by Information Society, the government's technological consultancy arm. The result has often been confusing for SMEs, which have to invest a substantial amount of time in chasing up funding. The structure of the HDB was leveraged well during the pandemic, however: of the EUR16.3bn it has disbursed in its 20-plus-year history, EUR6.2bn was pandemic-related support funding.
What to watch
- More changes are in store regarding the country's lucrative golden visa programme. The plan is intended to grant investors residence permits, but many of those investments have been converted to short-stay rentals. The negative effect on the local real estate market and the ability of Greeks to compete has led the government to step in to limit the impact. The government increased the investment required in Athens, Thessaloniki and some of the more popular islands, and more recently it has set minimum size requirements. There are likely to be further adjustments to the programme in 2024-25, but given its benefits for the state coffers it is unlikely to be wound up.
- An "investor ombudsman" service has been operating for more than a decade to examine deadlocked investments and remove stumbling blocks. The ombudsman is available for investments in excess of EUR2m. No data is available as to its efficacy.

Overview: Greece uses the euro, and contracts may be settled in that currency or in foreign exchange. The European Central Bank publishes the daily euro:foreign exchange reference rates on its website. Most transactions use that rate, though commercial banks are free to offer more competitive ones. In September 2019 the newly elected ND government abolished the remaining exchange and capital controls that had been put in place in June 2015 to prevent a mass withdrawal of cash from the banking system at the height of the debt crisis. The restrictions contravened the rules of the common currency, but the European Commission deemed them justifiable at the time to maintain the stability of the Greek financial system.
Strengths: As an EU member, Greece is subject to a common EU foreign trade and exchange policy. Within the EU no tariffs or quotas are permitted, and the bloc has abolished most other non-tariff trade restrictions, such as health regulation that favours domestically produced goods. The EU has a customs union with Turkey, includes Norway and Iceland in the European Economic Area, and has a range of bilateral agreements enabling free trade and other economic exchange with Switzerland. Greece is also a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Weaknesses: Agriculture is excluded from all of these arrangements. Outside agriculture, trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU remains committed to the WTO and its dispute arbitration procedures. Efforts to resolve a long-standing appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body have so far failed. This has undermined the effectiveness of the body's arbitration procedures. Greece has so far been largely unaffected (directly) by the global pick-up in tariffs in recent years.
What to watch
- Greece has strongly supported the EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been closely coordinated with the US and other Western allies and involves the imposition of far-reaching sanctions. As at end March 2024 the EU had imposed 13 packages of financial and individual sanctions on Russia. We expect these sanctions on Russia to remain in place in 2024-28 and far longer.
- Greece was among the more than 130 countries that endorsed the OECD global tax deal. The agreement aims to introduce sweeping changes to international tax rules, including a 15% minimum corporate tax and provisions to tax large companies based on where their goods and services are sold. Implementation will largely depend on the outcome of the US election in November 2024.

Overview: Corporations, limited liability companies and branches are taxed on total annual profits before distribution of dividends, fees to directors, bonuses and profits to employees. Resident corporations and limited liability companies are taxed on net income earned in Greece and abroad. The government has made efforts to improve tax collection by reducing tax evasion and widening the tax base so that high tax rates can be reduced. The ND government, seeking to reverse the upward trend in tax rates over the previous decade, enacted a series of consecutive corporate and real estate tax cuts. After a delay caused by the pandemic, plans to widen the base for property tax by aligning tax values with market prices resumed in 2022.
Strengths: The corporate income tax rate is one of the highest in the EU, at 22% in 2023, but is on a consistent downward trajectory from a high of 28% in 2019. The Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR) is enhancing its operational capacity and efficiency by adopting modern collection and audit tools, as well as increasing staffing levels. Tax revenue increased by 14.7% in 2022 compared with 2021 and by a further 9.2% year on year in 2023.
Weaknesses: Given the size of the public debt, the overall tax burden is unlikely to be reduced substantially during the forecast period. Greek tax law is complicated, with many elements introduced to promote short-term policies or alleviate specific economic problems. The law provides a framework, supplemented by ministerial decisions and interpretive circulars from tax offices. Although the latter assume the force of law, they sometimes contradict the legislation they are supposed to clarify and are often challenged in the courts. The complexity adds to the administrative burden of compliance, and the burden of taxation on labour remains higher than the EU average. Further reform of the tax administration will remain a priority but is likely to be painfully slow.
What to watch
- Efforts to improve the efficiency of the justice system have had mixed results, which suggests that progress towards reducing the backlog of tax appeal cases is also likely to be slow.
- Debt management units are being establised in all larger tax offices to concentrate on tax arrears that can be paid through the negotiation of instalment plans. This may have a positive impact in reducing tax arrears owed to the state, giving the government more leeway to reduce tax rates gradually over the medium term.

Overview: Greek banks have reduced their NPL exposure, strengthened their capital adequacy and started to return to private ownership. Nonetheless, they have one of the highest net interest margins in the Eurosystem and, at 59%, by far the lowest loan/deposit ratio (the Eurosystem average is 104%) as at late 2023. In short, they have returned to profitability but are not exactly fulfilling their role in funding the economy. To SMEs, they remain expensive and unavailable.
Strengths: Since 2015 Greek banks have made remarkable progress in strengthening their balance sheets by reducing exposure to non-performing assets. Outstanding NPLs in the banking sector fell from EUR118bn in June 2015 to EUR12bn in September 2023, reducing the NPL ratio from 43.2% to 7.3% over the same period, through direct sales of NPL portfolios and securitisations. Greek banks were stress-tested in 2023, and all four systemic banks passed and performed much better than in their respective 2021 tests. The HFSF, which was tasked with recapitalising the banks during the country's financial crisis, has started to divest its stakes.
Weaknesses: The Bank of Greece has initiated a process of re-licensing loan servicers. The sector became prominent in allowing banks to lower their NPL exposure, but the regulator plans to tighten the regulatory framework. As a result, about half of the 20 companies licensed will cease to operate. The sector is heavily concentrated, with the top three servicers managing about 90% of portfolios.
What to watch
- Banks are due to be stress-tested again in 2025. At that point Greece will have had (with the exception of the covid-19 pandemic) one of the longest expansionary cycles it has ever known. The banks are likely to pass the stress tests in 2025, as the sector continues to improve capital adequacy and liquidity, but the stock of NPLs is still far above the euro area average of 2% and will remain a burden on the real economy.
- The tight control of the market by the four systemic banks will inevitably incentivise other aspirants to enter the market. We expect competition to re-emerge.

Overview: Greece's labour market is one of the least flexible in the euro area, but this has been improving gradually, and it is likely to become more flexible in the coming years. Labour market liberalisation, economic recovery, emigration and government support during the coronavirus pandemic have helped to reduce the unemployment rate, which was 10.5% in December 2023, down from a peak of 27.9% in July 2013. Government measures prevented a sharp rise in unemployment during the pandemic-induced lockdowns, and, even though these have since been withdrawn and the minimum wage raised four times, unemployment has remained on a downward trajectory.
Strengths: Greece generally offers a wide range of skilled labour. Many young people have the academic qualifications that theoretically would qualify them for management positions, but most foreign companies prefer in-house training. In part, this may relate to Greece's low performance in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). In the 2022 assessment 38% of Greek 15-year-olds were "low achievers" in reading and 47% in mathematics, compared with OECD averages of 26% and 31% respectively. A series of reforms have been passed covering vocational training (in December 2020), higher education (February 2021 and July 2022), and primary and secondary education (August 2021). A notable reform passed in March 2024, effectively ending the state monopoly in higher education. In December 2023 the framework for work permits for third-country residents was reformed to allow thousands of land workers and other low-skilled workers to attain residency and social security, amid a growing deficit of low-skilled employees since the pandemic.
Weaknesses: High youth unemployment has led more than 400,000 young, educated Greeks to seek work abroad. With a labour force of about 4.7m, the negative effect on the labour market has been huge. Government efforts to reverse the trend have focused mostly on temporary tax reprieves for those who return. However, this has not alleviated the underlying structural deficiencies that cause young people to leave, and so far has not had a lot of traction.
What to watch
- The statutory pension age and the minimum pension eligibility ages, of 67 and 62, are set to be revised every three years, with the next revision set for 2024. The idea is to remain in tandem with life expectancy, but, as this has not changed much recently, owing in part to the pandemic, it is possible that no revision will take place before 2027.
- The March 2024 reform of higher education allows the licensing of non-profit tertiary educational institutions in Greece. The law will have to be followed by a host of minor regulations and judicial reviews, but it could have a significant positive impact on the labour market once it is set into motion.

Overview: The poor quality of Greece's transport and communications networks is holding back the country's international trade and investment potential. Delays to plans to improve infrastructure arise for a variety of reasons, including scarcity of funds, administrative complexity, and political opposition at local and national level. The main gaps include the need to upgrade the rail network, improve interconnections between domestic and international transport links, overhaul the coastal shipping network to improve the accessibility of islands and reduce overreliance on the port of Piraeus, and promote multi-modal freight transport by improving rail connections to Trans-European Transport Network ports such as Thessaloniki.
Strengths: A motorway (Pathe) runs between Athens, the capital, and Thessaloniki, on the east coast of the mainland, and a highway-standard link (Egnatia) runs across the north from the port of Igoumenitsa to the Turkish border. Nine uplinks from Egnatia to the Balkans have yet to be completed. The tender for the long-term concession for Egnatia and three of its uplinks was awarded in August 2021 to a local construction firm, GEK Terna, and Egis of France. The deal was signed in March 2024. After long delays and re-routing, the southern portion of the Central Greece motorway is set to be completed in 2024. A northern portion costing EUR442m was agreed in early 2021 and is scheduled to be completed within three years. Auxiliary roadworks connecting central Greece to the Peloponnese without going through Athens were awarded in February 2023.
Weaknesses: A high-profile train crash in early 2023 failed to engender the political will to address dysfunction and delay and catalyse change. Only one project appears on the web page of the railway construction company, ERGOSE, which is charged with tendering and monitoring the development of the railways, as completed in 2023. This pertains to some bridgework in norther Greece. The immediately preceding one dates to 2018. Three separate signalling projects appear to be scheduled for completion in 2025. A lack of investment means that Greece has lagged well behind most of the rest of the EU in the move to fast broadband, in terms of both the availability of higher speeds and coverage.
What to watch
- A series of smaller ports are in the process of being privatised. Igoumenitsa was concluded in September 2023, and Heraklion and Volos had preferred bidders declared in June and September 2023 respectively. Two marinas, in Corfu and Pylos, also had preferred investors declared in 2023. A revamp of the privatised assets is likely during the 2024-28 forecast period.
- The RRF will provide much needed funds for investments as well as discipline with regard to timelines, especially as regards digital infrastructure.

Overview: Greece scores poorly on technological readiness, which measures how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. The country has risen up the ranks owing in part to the ND government's push towards digitalisation.
Strengths: The Inclusive Internet Index (published by Economist Impact, an EIU sister company) ranks Greece 18th out of 100 countries in 2022, up from 38th in 2021. The index ranks countries on four axes: availability, readiness, affordability and relevance. The improvement in 2022 came mainly on the relevance axis, which ranks Greece second globally. In the UN's E-Government Survey 2022 Greece was ranked 33rd out of 193 countries for e-government development-up from 42nd in 2020. In the EU's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) dashboard for the Digital Decade, Greece fared better than the EU average in terms of e-government users, with 80.5% of internet users using e-government services compared with an EU average of 74.2%.
Weaknesses: Greece still scores poorly on readiness (48/100) in the Inclusive Internet Index. In the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking produced by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), Greece ranked 52nd out of 64 countries in 2024. Future readiness was the worst axis for Greece, where it ranked 57th. Greece also ranks last in the EU for take-up of internet access of more than 100 Mbps, with 20.3% as compared with an EU average of 55.1%. It is also far behind the EU in terms of fixed very-high-capacity network coverage (28% versus 73%).
What to watch
- Greece's national recovery and resilience plan under the EU's post-pandemic investment scheme includes EUR7.1bn (23.3% of the total) for digitalisation projects. The impact could be transformative.
- Greece passed legislation in February 2024 to set up a national cyber-security agency, which it aims to have staffed by October 2024 to comply with the EU's Network and Information Security 2 (NIS2) Directive.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The re-election of ND provides reassurance to investors that Greece will remain on a reforming path in the next four years. EIU assumes that the government will keep up the momentum of reform, especially in the light of a series of recent disasters that have exposed policy, planning and reform failures. Responding to the infrastructure problems highlighted by the Tempi train crash and floods in 2023 will be a major policy focus. These events will result in a change in disaster-management protocols and responsibilities, as well as greater scrutiny of privatisations, including the listing of Athens International Airport and the disposal of the state's stake in the Attica Tollway, which are under way.
In the medium term the main economic policy challenges are unchanged: diversifying economic activity to reduce dependence on tourism, improving competitiveness and continuing to strengthen the public finances. The impetus for reform will come from Greece's eligibility for EUR35.95bn from the EU recovery fund. Added to the EU's multiannual financial framework, Greece potentially has access to a total of about EUR75bn in EU funds in 2021-27. The government's reform plan focuses on the green and digital transformation and measures to boost employment, social cohesion and private investment. The European Commission has granted Greece's request to modify its national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP) and add a REPowerEU chapter (in line with the Commission proposal on the green energy transition), including energy-efficiency measures, and to access an additional EUR5bn in loans. Following approval of the amended plan by the European Council, the European Commission disbursed Greece's third payment for grants of EUR1.7bn and loans of EUR1.9bn in December 2023 and a pre-financing grant of EUR159m in January 2024, taking the total disbursed so far to EUR7.6bn in grants and EUR7.3bn in loans, about 41% of the total. Greece will request a further EUR1.7bn in grants and EUR1.9bn in loans in April, which will bring the funds disbursed to 51.5% of the total after they are received. We expect the pace of disbursements to pick up as Greece seeks to draw down its full quota of recovery funds by late 2026.
Reforms tied to the NRRP funding include adapting the law relating to electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, updating waste-management legislation, establishing a national registry of procedures for a "user-oriented" public service, updating the upskilling and lifelong-learning strategy, improving mental health services, and strengthening the anti-corruption framework. The government is investing in a second and third round of renovations to improve energy efficiency of residential buildings, develop accessible electric charging points, deploy fibre-optic infrastructure in residential and business buildings, and modernise the Citizens' Service Centres.

Government debt 161.9 155.7 150.5 142.4 134.4 126.7
The ND government is committed to meeting fiscal consolidation targets agreed with euro zone institutions. We forecast further modest fiscal consolidation in 2024 and a primary budget surplus of 1.7% of GDP, following an estimated general government budget deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2023. Based on public spending restraint, a robust revenue/GDP outturn over the medium term amid strong economic growth, and the continued disbursement of grants and loans under the EU recovery fund, we forecast a gradual reduction in annual deficits in 2025-28. Strong nominal GDP growth has helped to reduce the public debt/GDP ratio to about 162% at end-2023, from 173.3% at end-2022. We forecast a debt/GDP ratio of about 127% at end-2028.
To support investor confidence, the government maintains a cash buffer of about EUR35bn, enough to cover its gross financing needs for more than three years should market conditions deteriorate. The Public Debt Management Agency raised about EUR10bn in bond issues and reissues in 2023, more than covering last year's borrowing needs. The agency plans to raise at least EUR7bn in international bond markets in 2024 and will continue to focus on extending the maturity of Greece's debt, reducing the risks arising from higher interest rates.
Monetary policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) has put upward pressure on Greek government borrowing costs. However, there is increased market confidence in the sovereign: in October 2023 S&P became the first major international credit rating agency to upgrade Greece to investment-grade status, after more than 12 years of its debt being rated as "junk", following the Greek and euro zone sovereign debt problems of 2010-12. Markets had already largely priced in an upgrade, but the move will underpin confidence and help to attract greater capital inflows of all kinds to Greece. The yield on Greece's ten-year benchmark bond was 3.3% in early April 2024. This is only about 106 basis points above the equivalent German bonds, and down from an average of 4% in 2023.

We believe that the ECB has ended its most aggressive ever tightening cycle, but interest rates will remain at a record high until at least June 2024. At its latest monetary policy meeting, On April 11th, it kept interest rates unchanged after ten consecutive rate increases totalling 450 basis points. The ECB believes that financial conditions are currently tight enough to bring inflation back to its 2% target in the medium term, provided that interest rates remain high for a "sufficiently long" period. Euro zone inflation eased to 2.4% in March, with core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy prices) declining to 2.9%. We believe that the deposit rate and the main refinancing rate will remain at 4% and 4.5% respectively until June 2024. We expect the ECB to start easing monetary policy from June, with the main refinancing rate settling at about 2.3% in 2026-28 (well above the average in the 2010s, reflecting higher investment-especially in green technologies and defence-as well as a tight labour market).
Tight financing conditions will dampen demand in the euro zone in 2024, raising the risk of a hard landing. Households and businesses will continue to face high borrowing costs and tight credit conditions in the near term. This will dampen private consumption and push up costs for firms, in turn reducing investment and leading to an uptick in business bankruptcies. Sell-offs in the sovereign bond markets as the ECB progressively reduces its balance sheet in 2024 are a risk. The reinvestment of proceeds from maturing assets under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) has so far been the first line of defence against a widening in sovereign spreads; the winding-down of this programme risks a sharp deterioration in borrowing conditions for highly indebted southern euro zone economies.

We forecast a pick-up in real GDP growth in 2024, to 2.8% from 2% in 2023, followed by a further acceleration in output to an annual average of 3.2% in 2025-28 as the energy and inflation crisis eases and the Greek economy benefits from strong investment growth, supported by generous EU funds, and a return of economic confidence. Over the medium term, tourism and shipping will remain drivers of growth. The modernisation of the economy will also be supported by unprecedented inflows of EU funds, of which Greece is one of the biggest beneficiaries. Following the protracted crisis of the 2010s, the economy has scope for considerable catch-up growth more akin to an emerging economy, and we expect faster growth rates than the euro zone average. The main risks to this forecast are a potential widening of the conflict in the Middle East and slower growth among Greece's trading partners in the EU than expected.
A combination of still-high unemployment, still-high inflation (compared with historical levels), burdensome direct and indirect taxes, heavy household debt relative to disposable income, fiscal tightening, and tight credit conditions will continue to put pressure on private consumption in 2024-28. However, household spending will be supported by strong nominal wage growth and pent-up demand following a decade of austerity after 2010. Following household expenditure growth of 1.6% in 2023, we forecast average annual growth of 2.4% per year in 2024-28.
Pressure on Greece to tighten fiscal policy will result in slightly negative government consumption growth in 2024-25, following spending restraint in 2022-23, and modest growth rates in 2026-28. The difficulties for the government of meeting stringent primary surplus targets required by the country's euro zone creditors will be partly offset by a boost to government spending from the EU recovery fund.
We expect the continued disbursement of substantial EU recovery funds to support real fixed investment growth in Greece, which we forecast will average about 9% per year in 2024-28. However, there are downside risks from monetary tightening, and the strong recovery in investment will only partly offset the severe depletion of Greece's capital stock during the previous economic crisis of the 2010s.
We expect the tourism and shipping sectors to remain strong growth drivers over the medium term. Tourism has proved to be resilient and adaptable in the face of many challenges, and will remain competitive compared with regional peers. We forecast average annual growth in exports of goods and services of 5% in 2024-28, following growth of 2.8% in 2023. Real growth in exports of goods and services will roughly keep pace with that of imports over the medium term, but the external balance will nevertheless make a negative contribution to real GDP growth in 2025-28.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Greece's economy is driven by services, particularly tourism and shipping, and also by the real estate sector (closely related to tourism) and financial services. All of these sectors were badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions put in place to contain it. However, in 2021-23 all of these sectors recovered and performed strongly. Prospects for the next five years are positive, despite some headwinds in 2024. The government is seeking to diversify the economy further to reduce overdependence on tourism by focusing on the development of green and digital industries. Greece's strategic location as a potential energy hub for south-east Europe and its access to significant EU structural and recovery funds will create opportunities to diversify the country's economic mix, but this will require political commitment and a business environment conducive to investment.
Tourism will be a key driver of growth in services The tourism sector plays a major role in the Greek economy, accounting directly and indirectly for about 25% of GDP. Employment in the sector is about 11.5% of total employment directly and 22% including related sectors. The sector performed exceptionally well in 2023, despite the cost-of living crisis in Europe and further afield. For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic, the number of visitors exceeded 2019 levels, at 32.7m. As in 2022, tourism receipts were boosted by higher prices, with receipts increasing by 15.7% year on year to EUR20.5bn. We expect the sector to exhibit strong growth during the forecast period, supported by competitive pricing compared with other destinations in Europe; the release of continued pent-up demand for tourism services in places such as China, where outbound tourism has yet to recover after the pandemic; the further extension of the tourism year beyond the summer season; and positive global perceptions of Greece as a leading tourism destination.
Greece is the largest ship-owning nation in the world, with the biggest share of the global commercial fleet in terms of transport capacity and value. Shipping accounts, directly and indirectly, for almost 8% of GDP, 3% of gross value added and 4% of total employment. According to the 2023 annual report of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS), the total capacity of the Greek merchant fleet-which currently numbers 5,520 vessels-has doubled over the past ten years and now represents about 21% of the total global fleet in deadweight tonnage (DWT) terms. Greek shipowners continue to expand their fleet, accounting for the largest order programme in the world in value terms in 2023. Greek owners contracted a total of 267 new builds with a combined DWT of 26.6m, representing a 60% increase from the previous year's order-book. The value of new-building contracts reached US$18.1bn, or 16% of the total value of global orders placed. The crude oil and product tanker sectors were the main growth driver in new-building orders (accounting for 15m DWT), while significant investment was also made in liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. More new-building investments are expected in the coming years, as the total order book currently represents only 10% of the capacity of the active Greek fleet, a percentage that is below the global standard. Greek shipping has benefited enormously from the expansion of Piraeus port under Chinese ownership, which has resulted in a major increase in capacity and connectivity, making it the fifth-biggest port in Europe. The privatisation of Thessaloniki port has also resulted in an expansion of its capacity, albeit to a lesser degree. Greece is focused on upgrading other ports at Alexandropouli and elsewhere as it seeks to expand its role as a transport and energy hub in southern Europe. Shipping will continue to play an important role in driving economic growth in the forecast period. However, disruption to shipping from attacks by the Yemeni Houthi group in the Red Sea, a major global trading route, poses downside risks to our forecast of 2.8% real GDP growth in Greece in 2024. Another challenge over the medium and long term will be to invest in training a future generation of workers for the shipping industry, especially as Greece seeks to lead the green transition in shipping.
The health of the real estate market is closely tied to the tourism sector Real estate activity rebounded strongly in 2022-23 from a slump in 2020-21. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into Greek real estate rose from EUR875m in 2020 to EUR1.98bn in 2022 and EUR2.13bn in 2023, according to Bank of Greece (the central bank) data. About half of the total foreign investment in real estate in 2023 came from euro zone countries (25%) and China (24%); another 25% came from Switzerland, non-euro zone EU countries and the UK. The recovery in the property market is being driven by an improved macroeconomic environment, investor confidence and a strong performance by Greece's tourism sector. The government's golden visa and residency programme has also boosted demand for real estate from foreigners. However, sharply rising property prices and more demanding requirements for the golden visa scheme could dampen demand for real estate in 2024. Sluggish growth in the major European economies could also have a negative impact on the tourism sector and depress investment demand for Greek properties. However, we expect growth to continue in the medium term, albeit at a more moderate pace.
The financial services sector went through a difficult period in the ten years to 2019, suffering from weak profitability, a huge depletion of assets, deleveraging and a major asset quality problem. A rapid balance sheet clean-up in recent years strengthened the Greek banking sector but depressed profitability, which finally recovered in 2022-23. The sector's growth prospects will be strongly correlated with political stability, continued reform progress and the continued reduction of non-performing loans (NPLs). The latter could rise again if insolvencies increase during harder economic times. Capitalisation of Greek banks remains one of the lowest in Europe and may not be sufficient to cover future spikes in NPLs.

Labour costs per hour, manufacturing (US$) 18.9 20.3 21.8 23.0 23.9 24.7
With significant slack remaining in the domestic labour market and an easing of global price pressures, we expect inflation (EU harmonised measure) to slow further, to an annual average of 2.1% in 2024-28. Consumer price inflation decelerated from an average rate of 9.3% in 2022 to 4.2% in 2023, reflecting base effects, but price levels will remain much higher than before the Ukraine crisis. Core inflation (excluding energy and food) remains relatively high, holding back household consumption.

The euro will remain broadly stable against the US dollar until mid-2024, as we expect both the ECB and the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) to have concluded their tightening cycle and that interest rates will remain at their current levels until mid-2024. This will keep the Fed-ECB interest-rate differential at its narrowest since mid-2022. The euro appreciated against the dollar in the first half of 2023, reaching a 16-month high of US$1.11:EUR1 in mid-July, before easing in the second half of the year. The appreciation was the result of an improvement in the region's terms of trade, but market concerns about the economic outlook in 2024 have prompted the depreciation in recent months. We expect a gradual appreciation of the euro against the dollar from mid-2024 as the euro zone's current-account surplus supports the currency's value.

Secondary income balance 1.4 1.7 2.1 2.8 2.2 2.0
An improvement in the trade, services and secondary income balances was partly offset by a deterioration in the primary income balance in 2023, resulting in a current-account deficit of EUR14.2bn, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP (down from 10.3% in 2022). Another strong performance in the tourism sector in 2024 will boost the travel balance of the services account. However, import volumes and prices will start to rebound from 2024 onwards, and this will widen the goods deficit. We forecast that the current-account deficit will average 5.9% of GDP in 2024-28 as energy prices remain at relatively high levels, domestic demand recovers and the impact of EU recovery funds wanes from late 2026, when disbursements are due to end.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Greece Stocks and flows Greece is a small host of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) compared with other EU countries. Stocks and inflows are well below those of many of the central and east European countries that joined the EU in 2004. FDI outflows have in some years exceeded inflows. Most inflows have been for the acquisition of existing companies either through privatisation sales or joint ventures with local partners. There was significant disinvestment after the sovereign debt crisis, particularly in the retail and banking sectors: according to data from the Bank of Greece (the central bank), the stock of FDI fell from a peak of US$55.1bn (17.5% of GDP) in 2007 to US$25.6bn (10.9% of GDP) in 2014. According to EIU estimates, the FDI stock regained 2007 levels in 2022, when it represented more than 25% of GDP. It remained around the same level in 2023, when FDI inflows totalled US$5bn. Greece's FDI stock remains below the levels of new EU member states in the former communist Balkans, such as Romania (about 48% of GDP). Greek companies' FDI stock abroad was US$51.7bn (18.2% of GDP) at end-2011. Much of this outward investment was in the Balkan region, although Greek companies have also looked further afield to invest in North Africa, Turkey and, in a few cases, the US. The outward stock had declined to US$18.3bn by end-2023, equivalent to 7.7% of GDP, as a result of retrenchment by Greek companies and banks.
Origin and distribution Historically, the US was a major source of FDI for Greece in heavy industries such as refining and chemicals. Since Greece entered the common market, EU countries, particularly Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (because of its status as a financial hub for special-purpose entities-SPEs-created by multinationals for inward and outward FDI), have become the main investors. However, at the height of the Greek crisis in the 2010s most foreign firms sold off their interests in the country's financial services sector, resulting in net negative inward FDI stock figures for the sector for ten consecutive years in 2012-21. In 2023 Luxembourg (EUR669m), Cyprus (EUR655), Switzerland (EUR559m), Germany (EUR516m) and the Netherlands (EUR489m) accounted for more than 50% of Greece's total inward FDI stock. A number of Chinese transport and logistics companies have made large investments in Greece with a view to creating a gateway into the EU for Chinese manufacturers. However, such investments have come under increased scrutiny as a result of the screening regime introduced by the EU in late 2020. Chinese investment in Greece in 2023 totalled EUR386m. US investment in Greece has risen modestly in recent years as bilateral defence and security relations have assumed greater importance, with the US investing a total of EUR1.74bn in 2020-24.
According to the Bank of Greece, in 2023 services accounted for 61.6% of inward FDI flows and about 55% of the FDI stock. Real estate activities accounted for 45% of FDI into services and 27.7% of total FDI inflows. Encouraged by government incentives, foreign real estate investment has risen sharply in recent years. Finance and insurances services attracted only EUR279m in FDI inflows in 2023, down from EUR2.5bn in 2022. FDI inflows into accommodation and foodservice activities totalled EUR416m in 2023. Manufacturing accounted for 16.9% of total FDI inflows, slightly down from 18.9% in 2022, and construction 4.4%.
Determinants Factors that have traditionally held back greater levels of inward direct investment include Greece's geographical remoteness from core EU markets; its small domestic market; excessive product and market regulation; underdeveloped transport and communications infrastructure; a reluctance to allow companies in so-called strategic sectors to be majority foreign-owned; widespread red tape and corruption; and an unstable tax regime. However, the investment climate and broader business operating environment have improved over the past five years under the pro-business centre-right New Democracy government, which was re-elected for a second term in June 2023.
Impact The share of FDI inflows in gross fixed investment in Greece, at 15.1% in 2023, is well below the EU average. This reflected disappointing FDI inflows of just EUR5bn in 2023, after two much better years in 2021-22. Increased foreign participation in privatised or part-privatised companies would help to modernise the economy, bring increased know-how and boost productivity. One example of such a success story is the purchase of a majority stake in the Piraeus Port Authority by China's Cosco. The investment has turned Piraeus into one of the biggest and fastest-growing ports in the region, opening the way for the site to become a major multimodal transhipment hub in the Mediterranean and the most important sea trade gateway into Europe, potentially bringing significant benefits to the economy. Investment by South Europe Gateway Thessaloniki (SEGT), the German-led consortium that operates the Thessaloniki Port Authority, has helped to increase throughput at Greece's second-largest port.
Potential The pay-off from structural reforms in terms of increased competitiveness will take years to materialise fully, and could be reversed or diluted as a result of political changes. In the medium term the country will offer opportunities for investment in renewable energy and greenfield new technology ventures if red tape continues to be reduced and labour costs stay competitive. We project average annual FDI inflows of about US$6.1bn in 2024-28.

Age structure is set to change dramatically over the long term According to UN projections, the population will decline by an average of 0.4% per year in 2024-28 (the forecast period). However, life expectancy is increasing again following the covid-19 pandemic, when it declined in Greece and across Europe. In 2022 the UN estimated that Greek life expectancy was 80.6 years, in line with the EU27 average. The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with the decline in the working-age population and rise in the elderly population (65 years and older) projected to continue. The proportion of people aged 65 and over is forecast to rise from an estimated 23.1% in 2023 to 25% in 2028. Population ageing will be an increasing burden on already indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.
The economic impact of an ageing population will be exacerbated by the continued decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, which means that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to the working-age population) will rise compared with the previous five years. EIU forecasts that the population of people of working age will decrease by an average of 0.6% per year in 2024-28, which is marginally slower than the average rate of decline in 2019-23, reflecting less outward migration, some reverse migration of young professionals and the integration of more migrants into the labour force. The labour force, however, is projected to decline by an average of 0.1% over the forecast period, slightly less than a decline of 0.3% on average in 2019-23, as a result of higher participation rates due to a rise in the effective retirement age and an increase in the number of women in work. The labour force participation rate for women is much lower than that for men and is one of the lowest in the EU. The gender employment gap-the difference between the employment rates of men and women of working age (20-64)-was 10.7 percentage points in 2022. In some areas of Greece it stood at more than 20 percentage points. Bringing about an increase in the participation of women in the workforce necessitates a wide range of policies, and change is likely to take time. We expect a gradual modest increase in the employment rate for women over the medium and long term.
According to Eurostat, the foreign-born population of Greece as at January 1st 2023 was 1.17m-equivalent to 11.3% of the total population, with 9% having been born outside the EU. Migrants from Albania (48%), Georgia (7%) and Russia (5%) make up the main groups by nationality. In 2015 legislation granted Greek citizenship to second-generation immigrants. This was an important change, as the relative share of native-born immigrants within the total number of immigrants is high, at 31.2%. Prior to the new law, children born to migrants in Greece received a "maternity clinic certificate", not a birth certificate, leaving them without proper legal status. As they were not Greek nationals, they were not entitled to the same rights-such as travelling, working and studying within the EU-as EU citizens.
Greece will continue to be in the front line of migration into Europe Greece continues to be in the front line of the migrant influx into Europe. About 800,000 migrants arrived in Greece in 2015, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). In March 2016 the Turkey-EU joint action plan stemmed the influx into Greece of migrants from Turkey, but numbers have crept up again in recent years. In 2022 about 96,700 immigrants entered Greece, 60% of them from non-EU countries. There were 29,069 asylum applications made in Greece in that year, mainly from refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Palestine.
Legislation regarding permanent residence and working rights is in line with EU regulations, allowing non-EU persons legally resident in the country for five years to acquire permanent resident status. Since 2006 all immigration has been linked to employment criteria based on available jobs, and these are posted at consulates abroad. Persons wishing to work in Greece have to acquire a permit through the consulate in their home country before arriving. Persons arriving in the country on student or tourist permits are not allowed to change their status and take employment. Those seeking to establish themselves in Greece as self-employed or as entrepreneurs have to fulfil detailed criteria demonstrating their relevant experience and supply evidence of having sufficient funds to support themselves so that they do not become dependent on the state. In 2020 the government introduced a 7% flat income-tax rate for ten years for new foreign retirees to Greece. In 2021 the government introduced a special visa regime and generous tax relief for foreign self-employed digital workers.

Greece is a small, fragmented market of 10.3m people, about 12% of whom live on its many islands. As a result, distribution has typically been a problem, which is exacerbated when the population is swollen by many millions of tourists in the high season. In 2023 Greece attracted almost 33m visitors (triple the population of the country). The pandemic led to a slump in foreign visitors in 2020-21, but numbers rebounded in 2022-23, reviving market opportunities and helping to drive overall growth of the Greek economy.
Greece is a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which places tough controls on external borders. Greece has been in the front line of recent mass migration into Europe-mainly from the Middle East and North Africa-that peaked in 2015. Road and rail development should gradually improve access between Greece and its Balkan neighbours in the coming years, enhancing the country's role as a distribution centre for the southern Balkans, as will development of the ports of Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Kavala and Alexandroupolis.
Consumer spending power will constrain market opportunities Over the forecast period market opportunities in Greece will be constrained by pressures on consumer spending power. Unemployment close to 10%, high taxes, tight credit conditions, lagging wages and the need to meet large government primary budget surplus targets to reduce Greece's huge public debt will make consumers cautious about spending. During the pandemic, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) slumped to US$17,960 in 2020-well below the EU average. This recovered to an estimated US$23,020 in 2023 and is forecast to rise to US$31,870 by 2028. This primarily reflects a robust recovery in GDP, from a low base during the Greek debt crisis of 2009-19, and also a shrinking population.
The negative spillover effects of the coronavirus crisis in 2020-21 and of the war in Ukraine that began in 2022, mainly in the form of higher inflation and monetary tightening, will reshape market opportunities. A return to the rapid pre-crisis (pre-2008) increase in one-person households is unlikely over the medium term, as the number of single people able to afford their own household will be limited given sharply rising property prices and disposable income constraints. This will have negative follow-through effects on demand in various consumer goods markets, such as white goods, consumer electronics and furniture. Other consumer durables that relied on a buoyant, debt-fuelled economy for sales growth are also likely to suffer, as households will show restraint with regard to big-ticket purchases in the forecast period. Internal migration to the cities will continue as young people abandon farming because of falling EU subsidies and the hope of better employment opportunities in the big cities: Athens (the capital), Thessaloniki and Larissa.

Food, beverages and tobacco, together with housing, household fuel, and household goods and services, absorbed an estimated 42.3% of consumer expenditure in 2023, and this ratio will decline only modestly to about 38.7% in 2028. Demand for housing will fall as a percentage of GDP compared with other items over the forecast period, in line with the broadly stagnant number of households over the next five years. Non-essential spending generally will also be held back by increased saving efforts by the population, as well as debt-reduction moves. Greater spending power among the immigrant community and population ageing will have an important influence on consumption patterns during the forecast period, supporting demand for communication and healthcare services.

EIU forecasts that Greek real GDP growth will average 2.5% per year in 2024-50. We expect annual growth to average 3% in 2024-30, slowing to 2.4% in 2031-50. This trajectory reflects the greater negative effect of demographic trends in 2031-50 compared with 2024-30, especially the contraction in the working-age population, which will become more significant as time goes on. Reasonable total factor productivity and capital stock growth will support a continued economic expansion in 2024-50, offsetting the negative contribution of labour to GDP growth from 2030.
Initial conditions: Several factors will hold back potential long-term GDP growth in Greece. The economy has a number of deep structural flaws that will continue to hinder growth in 2024-30 and 2031-50. In particular, a decline of just under 60% in real fixed investment in 2008-21 will undermine the economy's ability to generate growth over the longer term. There could be a significant boost to growth potential from EU recovery funds, although institutional shortcomings will hinder the implementation of related reforms. We expect that agricultural products, renewable energy, tourism and shipping will remain the country's principal exports in the long term, but the success of these and other industries will also depend on the restoration of competitiveness to the Greek economy within the euro zone. A marked deterioration in the demographic profile will result in diminishing opportunities to increase labour utilisation.
Demographic trends: The demographic profile will become increasingly unfavourable in 2024-50. The working-age population will decline steadily, despite immigration. Life expectancy is high, reflecting good living conditions and health standards (at least until recently). The birth rate is set to remain below the replacement level; since 2012 the crude death rate has exceeded the crude birth rate every year. The number of people aged 65 and over will increase from an estimated 2.4m in 2023 to 2.6m by 2030 and 3.2m by 2050. The number of people of working age will decline from 6.5m to 6.3m and 4.9m over the same period.
Transport links to neighbours should improve External conditions: Greece is geographically remote from the EU market, although less so since the EU's expansion to include Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Greece will continue infrastructure projects to improve transport links with the Balkan states of Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria (in part subsidised by the EU). Provided that the Balkan region can improve political and economic stability, better transport links with the countries to the north are expected to help to attract some investment from foreign companies wishing to establish a base in south-east Europe from a more established Western market. However, existing EU members are divided on the question of eastward enlargement, which has slowed progress.
Greek and EU relations with Turkey will also influence Greece's long-term economic prospects. Relations between Greece and Turkey have been improving since 2023 but remain fragile as a result of unresolved territorial and other issues. Relations are set to remain volatile, driven in part by domestic politics in Turkey, and we do not expect progress in the dispute over Cyprus. The EU opened membership negotiations with Turkey in October 2005. Some large member states, such as Germany and France, have stalled the talks on technical grounds. A deal over migration between the EU and Turkey in April 2016 was meant to revive the stalled accession negotiation process, but talks have remained in the doldrums. Our forecast is that Turkey will not join the EU as it is currently shaped. However, we expect that political tensions will have only a limited impact on broadly positive trade and investment relations between Greece and Turkey.
Political stability will be imperilled by public distrust of all political parties Institutions and policy trends: Greece has a well-established parliamentary democracy. However, the political system is prone to instability owing to polarisation and relatively low levels of trust in the mainstream political parties. A renewed surge in migration into Europe along the Balkan route as a result of war and state breakdown in the Middle East could potentially threaten social stability. Institutional effectiveness should improve moderately in 2024-50, but progress is likely to be constrained by political patronage and bureaucratic resistance to change.
We expect that red tape will be reduced and that the tax system will become more efficient. Labour law has been changed to ease the hiring and firing of workers, give priority to labour agreements at the company level and introduce more flexibility. However, we expect that the adoption of structural reforms to boost competitiveness will be inconsistent and will make a difference only over the longer term. Public debt and the cost of supporting an ageing population will remain high, leaving limited room for a substantial reduction in the overall burden of taxes and social-security contributions.
Long-term performance: We expect real GDP to grow at 3% per year on average in 2024-30 (3.4% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 2.4% (2.9% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 3.2% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. The scope for a further rise in labour force participation rates will be reduced, and we expect a decline in the working-age population. We expect the labour force to grow marginally in 2024-30, by an annual average of 0.08%, and to shrink by an average of 0.98% per year in 2031-50, resulting in an annual average fall of 0.70% in 2024-50. Overall, a long-term average real GDP growth rate of 2.5% and of 3% per head in 2024-50 will provide for only modest catch-up growth with Germany. Greece's GDP per head at market exchange rates will rise from 43.7% of Germany's in 2023 to about 55.7% by 2050.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is predicted to have significant negative effects on the natural ecosystems of Greece and on many important economic sectors over the long term; for example, it will affect biodiversity, species and habitat, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, transport, activities in coastal areas, and the built environment in urban centres, owing mainly to increased temperature, drought, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. According to specific climate change studies pertaining to Greece, the effects will lead to reductions in productivity, capital losses and additional costs arising from damage repair. According to a study by the Bank of Greece (the central bank), under an inaction ("business as usual") scenario, Greek GDP could fall by an annual 2% by 2050 and 6% by 2100. The study states that the total cumulative cost to the Greek economy could reach about EUR700bn (at constant prices of 2008) by 2100.
There is thus a clear necessity for the adoption of mitigation and adaptation policies. For example, the tourism and shipping sectors are of vital importance for Greece. The focus is on "Blue Growth", which is a long-term strategy to support integrated sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors. The Mediterranean region, where Greece is situated, is bordered by more than 20 countries, and a large part of the Mediterranean Sea remains outside national jurisdiction. As a result, co-operation on issues such as climate change and the environment is vital in order to manage maritime activities, tackle climate impacts, protect the marine environment and fight pollution in the Mediterranean region.
The Ministry of Environment and Energy is responsible for identifying potential climate change impacts, planning and co-ordinating adaptation measures and policies, and preparing a national adaptation strategy. The Climate Law approved by parliament in May 2022 contains targets for Greece to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels by 2030 and by 80% by 2040, and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. These targets are more ambitious than those set out in the national energy and climate plan (NECP) published in December 2019, which envisaged GHG emissions cuts of 42% by 2030.
In November 2023 Greece submitted to the European Commission an updated draft NECP, the final version of which must be submitted by all EU member states by the end of June 2024. On decarbonisation, the plan outlines the importance of carbon removal technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and provides projections of expected capacity for capture, storage and use up to 2050. On energy security, it sets out targets and policies to enhance security of energy supply, including a wide gas diversification strategy and ambitious forecasts for energy storage. On the internal energy market, the plan puts forward major steps for interconnection, notably by meeting the EU's 15% interconnectivity target with the commissioning of a second electricity interconnection with Bulgaria. On renewable energy, the plan projects renewable electricity generation reaching 82% of gross electricity consumption in 2030, with solar power becoming the main source of renewable electricity, and the share of wind power in installed capacity projected to double in 2030 compared with 2023.
Demographic and productivity headwinds The UN's long-term population projections for Greece, which we use in our long-term growth forecasts, assume a decline in the overall population from an estimated 10.3m in 2023 to 10.1m in 2030 and 9.1m in 2050. Falling fertility rates and continued outward emigration will result in a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. Greece's working-age population is projected to fall from an estimated 6.5m in 2023 to 6.3m in 2030 and 4.9m in 2050-a decline of more than 25% over the 2023-50 period. This is one of the steepest declines in the euro area. We forecast an only moderately slower contraction in the labour force, of 18%, from 4.7m in 2023 to 3.9m in 2050; this assumes an increase in the labour participation rate in the coming decades as the retirement age is raised and more women enter the labour force.
Such adverse demographic projections would imply a severely negative effect on long-term real GDP growth rates. This is especially worrying given Greece's poor historical track record when it comes to productivity growth. To achieve the average annual long-term real GDP growth rate of 2.5% that we forecast for 2024-50 will require significant improvements in employment, labour participation and productivity growth rates, which Greece has not achieved in recent decades. Over the past 45 years Greece's total factor productivity growth has averaged 0.2% per year, and since joining the euro zone in 2001 it has turned negative.
A rebound in investment is likely given the low levels to which it has sunk over the past decade and a potential boost from EU recovery funds, but this positive effect will not persist over decades. Once the capital stock is replenished, the boost to growth will dissipate and the negative effects of poor demographics and productivity will reassert themselves. The emphasis must therefore be on policies to raise employment rates and boost total factor productivity to avert the disaster of negative average growth rates over the long term. However, the empirical evidence suggests that even the most comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at transforming productivity and the labour market may not deliver the sort of pay-off in terms of growth that is needed.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 geographies covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each geography, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The geographies falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom geography in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-geography comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkey's political scene since coming to power in 2002. During this period they have tightened their grip on authority. Mr Erdogan's re-election as president in 2018 concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. His re-election in May 2023 will help him to further consolidate the country's centralised system of government and conservative autocratic trends. Mr Erdogan will continue to make most decisions himself, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. Domestic and regional political issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic, as Turkey performs a delicate balancing act between NATO, of which it is a member, and Russia over the latter's invasion of Ukraine.

- The business environment score for Turkey is lower in the forecast period (2024-28) than in the historical period (2019-23). Turkey falls by ten places in the global ranking, to 56th, and one place to the bottom (18th) of the regional ranking. Increased powers concentrated under the president and the politicisation of monetary policy have heightened uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. The government tends to favour credit-fuelled economic growth, instead of implementing structural reforms and reorienting growth to a sustainable path. Large external imbalances leave Turkey's economy vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment.

Turkey--highlights: Economic outlook   2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Real GDP growth (%) 4.5 3.1 3.4 3.3 3.5 3.8
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 53.9 52.3 29.9 20.0 11.1 10.7
Budget balance (% of GDP) -5.0 -4.5 -4.3 -3.0 -2.2 -3.3
Current-account balance (% of GDP) -4.0 -3.1 -1.9 -1.2 -1.5 -1.9
3-month Treasury rate (av; %) 19.8 31.4 30.3 20.7 12.6 12.0
Exchange rate TL:US$ (av) 23.8 35.3 41.5 45.5 48.0 49.8

- EIU expects real GDP growth to slow to an average of 3.4% per year in 2024-28-short of the government's annual 5% target but close to Turkey's medium-term potential. Despite the return towards more rational policy since June 2023, years of poor government policy and a lack of credible institutions have created large external imbalances and triggered repeated Turkish lira sell-offs that have fuelled a surge in consumer price inflation since late 2021. We believe that Turkey will avoid a balance-of-payments crisis during the forecast period, but this risk will remain high.

Population growth   0.7 0.5
Working-age population growth   0.6 0.4
Labour force growth   1.6 1.0

- The total population is projected to rise from 85.8m in 2023 to 88m in 2028, with the female population growing slightly faster than that of males. The total population is expected to grow by 0.5% per year during the forecast period (2024-28), compared with 0.7% during the historical period (2019-23). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of higher urbanisation rates, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control measures. Nevertheless, population growth is high by European standards, and life expectancy at an average 79.3 in 2024-28 remains among the lowest in western Europe.

Household consumption per head (US$) 7,460 8,100 8,890 9,040 9,350 9,830

- The large consumer market is one of Turkey's main attractions for businesses. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily. In 2023 GDP per head was US$13,389 at market exchange rates, up from US$10,522 in 2022, and US$39,753 at purchasing power parity (PPP), up from US$36,910 in 2022. We expect GDP per head to reach US$51,477 at PPP in 2028. Thereafter, GDP per head in Turkey will remain broadly unchanged, at about 65% of the EU average.

Turkey--highlights: Long-term outlook   2024-30 2031-50 2024-50
Growth and productivity (% change; annual av)
Growth of real GDP per head 2.9 2.3 2.5
Growth of real GDP 3.4 2.7 2.9
Labour productivity growth 2.4 2.6 2.5

- In the long term Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to be above that of emerging market peers such as Brazil, Russia and China. In 2024-50 we expect Turkey's economy to grow by an annual average of 2.9%, which will be well below the rates recorded in previous decades. Growth in GDP per head terms will be weaker, mainly reflecting lower labour productivity growth rates. Income levels will remain well below the EU27 average, but some convergence is likely. As a result, Turkey will remain an attractive market for international companies throughout 2024-50.

a EIU estimates.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade. Under current political circumstances accession will not be possible in 2024-28.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited, and its secular character has been weakened by the religious-conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule. There was a failed coup in July 2016. Turkey has a presidential system of government, in place since the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, changed the parliamentary system in 2018, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan, the AKP leader, who was re-elected for a third presidential term in May 2023.
Policy issues: The focus since mid-2023 has been on the dismantling of the irrational economic programme that started in 2021, characterised by ultra-low policy rates. The new economic programme emphasises the need for economic orthodoxy-including tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms-which will reassure investors. However, the process of rebalancing the economy comes with risk and will be gradual, in order to prevent potential financial sector problems stemming from corporate and household debt levels. Negative real interest rates and political risk make attracting adequate capital inflows challenging, which means that risks of further lira sell-offs and a balance-of-payments crisis will persist. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is an important challenge. Politicisation of the judiciary has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was reverted back to 25% in 2023, up from 23% in 2022 and 25% in 2021. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 40%. The top marginal tax rate applies to 2023 incomes of more than TL1.9m (about US$60,000). Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2023 goods exports totalled US$251.2bn and imports about US$337.9bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$86.6bn. The current-account deficit reached an estimated US$45.9bn, or 4% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his religious-conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey's parliamentary system of government was replaced by an executive presidential system in early 2018. The presidential system concentrates power in the hands of Mr Erdogan, allowing him and the AKP to govern with few checks and balances and clamp down on all forms of political opposition. The relative economic stability that the AKP delivered during the initial phase of its dominance in the early 2000s has been instrumental in the party's electoral successes, as has Mr Erdogan's personal appeal and his religious and conservative outlook, which is shared by much of the electorate. Although the popularity of the president and the AKP has fallen in recent years owing to a steep sell-off of the Turkish lira against all major currencies, soaring inflation and a weak labour market, Mr Erdogan was re-elected in May 2023 and the alliance led by the AKP won a majority in parliament. EIU expects a consolidation of the country's centralised system of government and the reinforcement of conservative autocratic trends. Mr Erdogan will continue to dominate Turkish politics through a mixture of authoritarianism, control of state resources and the bureaucracy, a tight grip on media, and his still-strong personal support among conservative voters.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP will broaden their power base at the March local elections Mr Erdogan and his AKP are aiming to broaden their power base and increase their domination of Turkish politics further in the local government elections on March 31st. They are determined to regain the metropolitan mayoral posts in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, which they lost to the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) in the last local elections in 2019. This would give Mr Erdogan an even stronger platform to pursue his ambitions, which range from boosting Turkey's international influence, building the controversial Canal Istanbul-a parallel waterway to the Bosporus-proposing a new constitution and potentially bidding for a fourth term as president in 2028. The AKP, which won 35.3% of the vote in the parliamentary election in May 2023, is set to emerge as the largest single party, capturing up to half of all the seats at stake. The opposition is divided, and the administration controls the media. Efforts to harass the opposition and silence criticism are also likely to be a routine feature of the campaign.

Political outlook: Political stability Mr Erdogan will remain in power until at least the next election, scheduled for 2028. The alliance led by Mr Erdogan and his AKP won a majority in parliament in May 2023, which will support political stability over our forecast period. We expect a consolidation of the country's centralised system of government and the reinforcement of conservative autocratic trends. Mr Erdogan will continue to make most decisions himself, meaning that foreign and economic policy will remain unpredictable. The executive presidential system already grants extensive powers to the president, including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary; this will continue. We also expect Mr Erdogan to continue to restrict political dissent and media freedom, and to stifle the opposition.
Mr Erdogan will continue to dominate Turkish politics in our forecast period through a mix of authoritarianism, control of state resources and bureaucracy, and a largely supportive domestic media. There is a high likelihood that he will remain in power beyond 2028 (despite currently being barred from serving another term by the constitution).
The risk of social unrest has strongly decreased since the May elections. However, a high degree of polarisation in Turkey and still-high inflation mean that social discontent remains strong. In the event of serious unrest, it is uncertain whether Mr Erdogan would have the complete support of the security apparatus.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Political and government effectiveness improved in the initial phase of the AKP's rule, which has lasted more than 20 years. The economy was well managed, and significant social reforms were implemented. However, since then intensifying domestic power struggles, the government's response to a resurgence of terrorist violence from mid-2015 and to a failed coup attempt in July 2016, and the transition to a presidential system of government with power concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan have led to an erosion of the rule of law and delayed long-overdue political and economic reforms. In the wake of the failed coup the government introduced emergency rule, which allowed it to carry out a purge of personnel in the military, the judiciary, the police force and academic institutions suspected of having links to the movement of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The judiciary and other previously independent authorities have been politicised. The quality of the bureaucracy remains moderate, and we do not foresee substantial improvement in 2024-28.
Policymaking institutions have become highly politicised The increased concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament mean that policy predictability and its overall long-term suitability, especially from the perspective of foreign investors, are suboptimal. Since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised-a feature that will persist in the medium term. The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) will remain subject to pressure from Mr Erdogan's credit-driven-growth approach to economic policymaking. In late 2021 Mr Erdogan imposed rate cuts on the CBT, despite accelerating inflation. The authorities believed that this low-interest-rate policy would encourage the use of credit by industry, stimulating investment and production, while the weak lira would increase export competitiveness and deter imports, thereby narrowing the country's perennial current-account deficit. The lira crashed after the adoption of low-interest-rate policies. The weak lira combined with high global commodity prices lifted inflation to record highs. The adoption of more orthodox monetary policies following the president's U-turn on interest rates after his re-election in May 2023 is under way. However, in several respects, the policy framework is still not rational. We expect the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the central bank may have to consider potential political pressure for looser policies. It will continue to be expected to consider other goals besides price stability.
Concerns about the impartiality and efficiency of the legal system are unlikely to be resolved over the forecast period, given the continued politicisation of the judiciary. An AKP constitutional reform package, which was approved by referendum in 2010, changed the appointment procedure and composition of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the Constitutional Court. The changes facilitated the replacement of conservative secularist-nationalists in the judiciary with Gulenists, who, until 2013, were close allies of the AKP. Shortcomings in the judicial process were highlighted in coup plot investigations and trials that began in 2007. These were only addressed at appeal stage and after suspected Gulenists in the judiciary began investigating allegations of government corruption in late 2013. The purge of Gulenists from the judiciary accelerated after the failed coup in 2016. The upheaval is likely to increase uncertainty in the judicial process and further prolong the resolution of cases.
Courts tend to interpret the law in favour of the state The courts' tendency to interpret the law in favour of the state and at the expense of the individual is unlikely to change, especially in cases involving minority rights and freedom of speech. In our business environment rankings we expect the transparency and fairness of the judicial process to remain poor and its efficiency to deteriorate in 2024-28.
Political outlook: Election watch Mr Erdogan won the 2023 presidential election with 52.2% of the vote. The election process appeared mostly free, but was deemed largely unfair owing to strong media bias and restrictions on freedom of expression. Mr Erdogan's AKP-led alliance secured a parliamentary majority, but this was its worst performance since 2002.
The next test for Mr Erdogan and his AKP will be the local elections on March 31st, at which we expect the AKP to narrowly win back Istanbul-Turkey's economic powerhouse and home to about a quarter of the electorate. The AKP's return to more orthodox economic policy (one of the opposition's main campaign promises) and a divided opposition support our forecast. Winning back Istanbul would help them to reinforce their support network and pave the way for further consolidation of the current regime.
Political outlook: International relations Although Turkey is a NATO member and a candidate for EU accession, it will maintain an independent foreign policy that is likely to be transactional rather than strategic, and will often clash with the other members. Negotiations over EU accession are currently frozen, and Mr Erdogan will not make any efforts to satisfy the rule-of-law criteria needed. Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in this sphere. Foreign policy will also remain unpredictable to a degree, which will weigh on investor interest in Turkey.
We do not expect a collapse in relations between Turkey and its traditional Western allies, the EU and the US, and NATO. Turkey needs the EU and the US on its side if it wants to attract global financial inflows and support for its economy. The EU and the US are likely to refrain from sanctioning Turkey harshly, as Turkey is a critical security partner for the US in the region and a NATO ally, and is also a vital partner for the EU in managing migration, and many countries have important commercial interests there. However, this forecast is uncertain given a large number of irritants. Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400 defence system in 2019 had already put severe strain on Turkish-US relations, leading to the introduction of mild US sanctions at end-2020. The West fears that Turkey is helping Russia to bypass sanctions, and Turkey's continued pressure on NATO members to change their policies on Kurdish activism has created frictions. Leading issues in Turkish-EU relations include human rights, Cyprus and territorial rights in the eastern Mediterranean. However, the vote by the Turkish parliament to approve Sweden's NATO membership at end-January supports our view that a break between Turkey and the West is unlikely.
Turkey's dire need for trade, tourism and financial investment has pushed Mr Erdogan to deepen or revive ties with non-traditional partners, particularly in the Middle East. In July 2023 he toured some Gulf countries, resulting in several economic and industrial deals. These include a financial accord with Qatar, a drone sale to Saudi Arabia and several agreements with the UAE (almost US$51bn and a partnership aimed at improving container port facilities). Qatar and the UAE provided Turkey with about US$20bn in currency swap agreements in 2020 and 2022, and Saudi Arabia deposited US$5bn into the CBT in March 2023.
Relations between Greece and Turkey have improved. In 2021, following the de-escalation of tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, Greece and Turkey put forward a new "positive agenda" intended to promote economic, trade and investment co-operation, leading to significant improvements in trade facilitation, connectivity and tourism flows. Economic rapprochement may reduce political tensions somewhat, but is unlikely to lead to breakthroughs on intractable political disputes in the short term-including tensions over the extent of their exclusive economic zones and hydrocarbons exploration, and an unresolved dispute over the division of Cyprus. With Cyprus focused on developing its hydrocarbons resources, and a solution to the unification problem unlikely, Turkey's activity in the island's exclusive economic zone will continue to put it at odds with Cyprus, Greece and other regional players.
The Israel-Hamas war means that Turkey's recent re-engagement strategy with Israel, which is focused primarily on energy, will be shelved at least while Benjamin Netanyahu remains in power in Israel. Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation, hosts members of the group on its territory and has taken an anti-Israel stance since the war started.
Mr Erdogan will continue to extend the country's influence in the South Caucasus-albeit without provoking Russia, with which it has developed closer economic and energy ties since 2016 despite some recent divergences around the Black Sea. From Turkey's perspective, forging closer ties with Russia, especially over energy imports and tourism, makes economic sense.

Overview: Turkey's business environment score in the forecast period (2024-28) is lower than for 2019-23. In the global ranking, Turkey falls by ten places to 56th. It fares worse than western Europe, as well as central and south-eastern Europe. Among large emerging markets, Turkey ranks just below South Africa, Mexico, India, Argentina and Brazil, but above China, Indonesia and Egypt.
Strengths: Turkey's strategic location and large and expanding market will remain attractive to businesses. It is an open economy with full currency convertibility since 1989 and a customs union with the EU in industrial goods since 1996. Despite difficulties in EU relations, and instances of protectionism, we expect these conditions to prevail. Turkey has a sophisticated financial system.
Weaknesses: The macroeconomic environment is unpredictable. Although more orthodox policies were adopted after the 2023 elections, business decision-making will continue to be complicated by high inflation and currency volatility. Economic policies and regulations are unpredictable. Gaps in transport, communications and energy infrastructure will remain.
What to watch
- Tighter economic policies will mitigate macroeconomic instability from 2024, but could also reduce demand and constrain financing opportunities. Fiscal discipline may entail additional taxation. Proposed structural reforms in areas like taxation and labour markets will meet resistance. An eventual return to unorthodox policies is unlikely but possible. The administration believes in private enterprise and welcomes foreign investment-not least given Turkey's large external financing needs. However, a significant element of crony capitalism and corruption will continue. The state-controlled enterprises and the trend towards nationalist and interventionist industrial/development policies add to the scope for favouritism. Regulators and the judiciary lack independence.

Business environment outlook: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The private sector benefits from incentives and support, but political bias, state enterprises, informality and intellectual property rights issues detract from free competition. Corruption perceptions are high.
2026-28: In several sectors competition remains limited and/or state ownership continues to play an important role.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Turkey actively seeks foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in prioritised sectors, although the few existing restrictions remain in place.
2026-28: FDI remains a priority. FDI affecting natural resources or requiring special concessions may still face opposition.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The customs union with the EU largely dictates Turkey's trade policies, but tariff and non-tariff protection against imports of various products from non-EU countries without free-trade agreements continues.
2026-28: Exporters adjust to the EU "green deal". Politics permitting, talks on updating and expanding the customs union may begin.
Taxes 2024-25: Tax rates remain higher than in the past. Some taxes on wealth, for example, may be increased. Efforts are made to reduce tax avoidance. Proposals are made to simplify incentives and increase the share of direct taxation.
2026-28: Tax reforms and anti-informality measures are only partly successful. The social-security deficit becomes more pressing.
Financing 2024-25: Banks manage their risks, but tighter monetary policies curb credit growth, while high inflation limits long-term lending. The authorities try to direct lending towards investments in digitalisation, greening and other priority areas.
2026-28: Financial conditions may ease. State banks still play a big role. Capital markets are promoted.
The labour market 2024-25: There is an ample supply of labour, but skill levels are mixed. The minimum wage keeps pace with inflation.
2026-28: Reforms to promote flexible employment remain incomplete or have a limited impact. Efforts continue to reduce informality and tackle skills gaps. The 2028 elections could be preceded by increases in real wages.
Infrastructure 2024-25: The Istanbul Airport expansion and the country's first nuclear reactor are operational. Black Sea gas production reaches full capacity. Earthquake-affected infrastructure is rebuilt. Other infrastructure investment is limited.
2026-28: Internet speeds improve. 5G mobile is rolled out. There is patchy progress on all forms of transport, nuclear and renewable energy, power supplies, and urban infrastructure. Vulnerability to earthquakes remains a critical issue.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Internet infrastructure and speeds start to improve. E-commerce grows further. Research and development spending remains moderate.
2026-28: High-tech industrial products increase. Businesses make wider use of IT, including AI.

Overview: Economic instability has been a major drawback of the business environment in Turkey, manifested in boom-and-bust cycles, exchange and interest-rate volatility, and very high inflation. The country's score and ranking for economic stability decline further in the forecast period, putting it on a par with Pakistan and Ukraine. The economy will remain sensitive to global financial conditions and investor perceptions, as well as international energy prices. Moreover, expansionary policies may again be adopted for political reasons, as has occurred frequently in the past. Tighter and more orthodox monetary policies were adopted following the presidential and parliamentary elections of May 2023, but long-term commitment to these policies is uncertain.
Strengths: Turkey's government debt level, at just over 30% of GDP, is low. The budget deficit widened in 2023 owing to pre-election spending and earthquake costs, which will persist in 2024. However, public deficits will remain low enough to prevent the debt/GDP ratio from reaching alarming proportions.
Weaknesses: Annual consumer price inflation stood at 64.8% at the end of 2023 following a series of currency slides, which increased the domestic prices of imported goods. EIU expects headline inflation to reach 70-75% before slowing sharply in the second half of 2024 in response to a more stable lira and tighter monetary policies. However, reducing inflation further in subsequent years will remain a challenge. Ingrained inflationary expectations will be hard to overcome, while a degree of lira volatility will be inevitable owing to variations in external conditions. International disputes could also affect the exchange rate, and many citizens will continue to save in foreign exchange.
What to watch
- The quality of policymaking may vary in the forecast period, and the underlying institutions may weaken further. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a proponent of low interest rates, will have the final say. He may continue to change his aides frequently (there have been five changes of central bank governor in 2019-24).
- Loose policymaking is particularly likely if economic activity slows markedly and/or as the 2028 elections draw closer.

Overview: Turkey's score and ranking in this category decline in the forecast period, leaving it well ahead of Egypt, China and Russia, and on a par with India and Italy, but behind most other European countries as well as the higher-ranked economies in Latin America and Asia. Turkey has a vigorous private sector. Regulation and supervision are based on Western practice and in many respects on EU norms. The government supports the private sector in many ways, including credit policies and guarantees, and regional and technology-oriented investment incentives. However, starting and running a business is relatively cumbersome, and rules and regulations may change frequently. The courts are often slow and unpredictable. Meanwhile, competition is inhibited by informal labour, tax avoidance, breaches of intellectual property rights and/or smuggling in some sectors and markets, and by the significant role of state enterprises in others. We do not expect major changes in these respects. We also expect the trend towards more interventionist and discretionary industrial incentive policies aimed at import substitution and local production of strategic items to continue. Perceptions of corruption will increase.
Strengths: Private property will continue to be well protected, perhaps with partial exceptions during the nationalisation of land for infrastructure or urban regeneration projects. Hundreds of companies were taken into public administration for alleged links to supporters of the coup attempt in 2016, but this is very unlikely to be repeated. On the other hand, progress on the enforcement of intellectual property rights-a major issue in numerous sectors including textiles and clothing, cosmetics, software, and pharmaceuticals-will be slow. The Competition Board will actively fulfil its brief of vetting mergers and acquisitions, and policing cartels and abuses of market position, although it will be open to political pressures and not always impartial.
Weaknesses: Privatisation momentum has waned in the past decade, with the main exception of state-owned land. State enterprises may now be seen as vehicles for development and will remain tools of patronage. Public companies will retain significant positions in banking, telecommunications, gas, power, mining, the defence industry, postal services, insurance, tea, sugar, water and infrastructure, as well as healthcare and education. The state will keep control of Turkish Airlines (with a 49% stake), the home-builder TOKI and the broadcaster TRT. The opaque Turkey Wealth Fund (TWF), established in 2016, which has become a holding company for state enterprises, may borrow to fund new infrastructure investments or to inject cash and take controlling or minority stakes in private companies for policy or political reasons.
What to watch
- In parallel with autocratic politics, there is extensive scope for favouritism, graft and sleaze in government-business relations. Private businesses close to the ruling parties will tend to enjoy favourable treatment from government institutions and regulatory and supervisory bodies in matters such as obtaining planning decisions, licences, incentives and state bank loans, and will be the main beneficiaries of public tenders, including the award of concessions or public-private partnership schemes.
- The government may be tempted to use price controls to check inflation. The Ministry of Trade is likely to continue to monitor retail prices and impose discretionary fines. Prices in the monopolistic, semi-liberalised electricity, gas, petroleum and telecommunications markets will continue to be controlled and may be set erratically. Pharmaceuticals prices will continue to be suppressed to contain public health spending.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries and territories. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: Turkey retains its score of 6.4 for policy towards foreign investment in 2024-28, but falls from 46th to 55th in the global ranking as other countries improve. This places it behind almost all west and central European countries and on a par with Egypt. The need for capital inflows and desire for investment in industry will drive official efforts to attract foreign investment. However, aside from drawbacks of the business environment in general, some forms of foreign investment will remain controversial in national politics and culture.
Strengths: Foreign ownership in industry and services is widespread and commonly regarded as normal. Given the need for foreign-capital inflows, all governments have been eager to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Greenfield industrial investments that use advanced technologies and help to increase exports and reduce imports are particularly welcome. Private sector mergers and acquisitions and investments in services are also commonplace. Expropriation is a very distant risk. Wholly or partly foreign-owned companies will continue to have equal legal rights and access to government incentives including tailored project-based incentives. The Investment Office of the Presidency will actively promote inward investment, negotiate with potential investors and steer them through the bureaucracy.
Weaknesses: Privatisation opportunities are likely to be limited. The sale of important state enterprises or assets to foreign interests may not be politically acceptable. Any further major increase in foreign ownership in the financial sector might also be opposed. Lifting formal restrictions on foreign ownership in broadcasting and civil aviation would be controversial. The day-to-day official treatment of foreign investors will sometimes be affected by Turkey's political relations with their countries.
What to watch
- Even if abetted by the government, foreign investors in mining and some other sectors will face hostility from sections of the public and potentially from the courts on grounds of natural resource nationalism or environmental risks. Current limits on real estate sales to foreigners are likely to remain in force, as these too have attracted criticism, partly owing to high inflation. The amount that individual foreign investors must invest in real estate to acquire citizenship, which was lowered from US$1m to US$250,000 in 2018 and raised back to US$400,000 in 2022, may be raised again.
- The government will continue to seek foreign investment and offer investment opportunities as a part of its foreign policy, potentially increasing foreign investment at the risk of exclusive and/or unpopular commitments. Examples so far include the ongoing Rosatom (Russia) Akkuyu nuclear power plant project, several Qatari investments-including the Antalya port management concession and shares in the armoured vehicle-maker BMC-and a 2023 accord favouring UAE energy investors.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries and territories. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: For foreign trade and exchange controls, Turkey ranks below the NAFTA countries, most EU countries, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. It is level with the UAE, South Korea and New Zealand. No change is foreseen in 2024-28. Turkey is well integrated into global supply chains and has a customs union with the EU. In 2024 merchandise exports amounted to about 23% of GDP and imports to about 32%. Nevertheless, there is a degree of protectionism, and trade in agriculture and services is not liberalised. There is a small risk of capital controls.
Strengths: The customs union of 1996 provides for customs-free trade in manufactured goods with EU member states. Turkey's import regime reflects the EU's common customs tariff and its free-trade agreements (FTAs). Turkey also has FTAs with the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA), the UK and 21 other countries. Further agreements are likely.
Weaknesses: Despite the EU customs union, disputes persist over direct trade with Cyprus, Turkey's ban on meat and used-car imports from the EU, its taxes on alcohol and tobacco products, the EU's visa practices and transport rules, and the asymmetrical impact of the EU's FTAs with third countries. Separately, Turkey resorts to short-term tariff and non-tariff protection against imports of various products from non-EU, non-FTA countries to support domestic producers. In late 2023 customs duties were increased on more than a thousand categories of yarn, cloth and knitwear, and market entry requirements for electric cars were toughened. Such measures are likely to continue. Imports of many agricultural products will remain subject to high tariffs and quotas and/or be allowed only on an ad hoc basis. Turkey too sometimes faces protectionist measures. It risks secondary sanctions for failing to adopt Western sanctions against Russia. Smuggling and "suitcase trade" will continue to complicate fair trade in a range of items from tobacco products to mobile phones.
What to watch
- Talks on improving the customs union and extending it to agricultural goods, services and public procurement may start within the forecast period, but political issues remain an obstacle. Any negotiations will be lengthy. Meanwhile, Turkey's exporters must adjust to the requirements of the EU's "green deal" Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to maintain the competitiveness of their products in the EU.
- The lira has been fully convertible since capital account liberalisation in 1989-even during periods of severe currency volatility. Some measures were taken to limit demand for foreign currency when unorthodox low-interest-rate policies were adopted in 2021-23. However, fears that restrictions would be imposed on access to foreign currency bank accounts or on international currency transactions did not transpire. The unorthodox policies were later abandoned, but similar policies and concerns could conceivably return.

Overview: Turkey's score remains unchanged for 2024-28, but it falls to 50th in the global ranking owing to improvements in countries like Indonesia, Greece and the Czech Republic. Turkey will continue to rank below most central and south-east European countries. OECD data show that tax revenue (including social-security contributions) fell to just 20.8% of GDP in 2022 (the OECD average was 34%). The low tax take is partly due to widespread informality, under-reporting and non-payment, and the many tax benefits introduced to encourage investment and employment or support various sectors, activities and social groups. In 2023 tax rates were increased and tax revenues (excluding social security) rose by 91.2%-well ahead of inflation. Turkey has agreements to prevent double taxation with almost all of its trading partners.
Strengths: Corporate and marginal taxation has been relatively low. As of 2023 corporation tax rate has been set at 25%-and 30% for financial institutions. This was one of several tax increases made to pay for election promises and earthquake relief and reconstruction. Advance payments are made quarterly. From 2024 a form of inflation accounting has been reintroduced. Personal income tax rates range from 15% to 40% in five brackets, which are redefined annually in line with inflation. A portion of employees' earnings equivalent to the minimum wage is effectively exempted. Further adjustments in corporate or personal income tax rates are not currently on the agenda.
Weaknesses: The budget relies heavily on indirect taxes, contributing to inequalities. In 2023 value added tax (VAT), VAT on imports and the special consumption tax (SCT) accounted for 11.2%, 21.1% and 20.6% of central government tax receipts respectively, whereas corporation tax accounted for 17.5% and personal income tax (overwhelmingly deducted at source from wages and salaries) for 15.4%. VAT is 20% (raised from 18% in 2023), with lower rates of 8% and 1% for some items. The lists of items subject to each rate may fluctuate. Rates and amounts of SCT vary and are often adjusted.
What to watch
- Tax reforms are possible. Efforts could be made to reduce informality and tax avoidance and to reduce exemptions and exceptions, while retaining those that are seen to be effective in supporting investment. Reforms could make taxes more transparent and predictable and raise the share of direct taxes. However, we anticipate only limited progress owing to resistance from the interest groups and constituencies affected.
- Recent increases in pensions and changes in legislation will increase social-security costs. Employees' social insurance contributions total 14% plus 1% for unemployment insurance (UI), while employers' contributions are 20.5% (15.5% for regular payers) plus 2% for UI. These percentages could be raised or employment incentives in the form of subsidies for employers' contributions reduced.

Overview: Turkey's ranking for financing deteriorates in the forecast period. Turkey will rank below all the developed and central European countries, the Gulf countries and the more advanced emerging economies elsewhere. Although the unorthodox policies of 2021-23 have been abandoned, removing distortions, future policy remains uncertain, and very high inflation persists-a major obstacle to long-term savings and investment financing in lira.
Strengths: Turkey has a sophisticated financial sector, led by the banks, while larger companies earning foreign currency can also access international loans and bond markets. At end-2023 total bank assets and bank loans (excluding financial sector loans) were about 90% and 44% of GDP respectively. There are more than 50 banks, including eight participation (Islamic) banks. Many have foreign ownership. The three main state-controlled banks and the largest four private banks account for three-quarters of total assets. Officially, the core capital-adequacy ratio of Turkish banks was a comfortable 15% of risk-weighted assets at end-2023, and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was only 1.6%. The banks will continue to dominate the sector and will be able to manage the market and credit risks associated with macroeconomic volatility. However, the growth of bank credit could sometimes be constrained by external funding costs, monetary policies, provisioning needs or government borrowing requirements. High and unpredictable inflation means that banks will mainly provide finance on a short-term basis.
Weaknesses: Capital markets are less developed than banking. There were a record 55 initial public offerings on the Istanbul stock exchange, Borsa Istanbul (BIST), in 2023, and market capitalisation approached US$340bn. A revival in share purchases by foreigners could support the market from 2024 onwards. Nevertheless, share prices will remain volatile and the market speculative.
What to watch
- The policies of 2021-23 created distortions and anomalies including deeply negative real interest rates, extraordinary rules for bank deposits and credits, obligations on banks to buy government bonds, and the introduction of exchange-rate-protected deposit accounts (which are still being unwound). At times the three main state banks, which account for almost 40% of all loans, were expected to increase or reduce lending in line with government policies. Some such policies could conceivably be attempted again.
- Lending by public institutions and official support for bank lending may increasingly be used as policy instruments. Existing arrangements include schemes for small businesses, periodic credit guarantees to facilitate borrowing by small and medium-sized enterprises, and central bank and state-owned bank lending to exporters. The central bank has also begun to extend larger, long-term loans to investors in specific sectors, while a proposed "social investment note" system would reward banks lending in prioritised areas with favourable treatment from the central bank. Such schemes may increase the availability of credit for investments in technological or environmental improvements, but carry the risk of market distortions, excess bureaucracy or favouritism.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries and territories. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: Turkey's labour market score improves slightly in 2024-28, but its ranking slips from 32nd to 38th owing to improvements elsewhere. Turkey will rank lower than most developed countries, central and south-eastern Europe, and the best performers in Asia. Turkey scores well for workforce health, labour costs and industrial disputes, but skill levels are modest, the formal labour market is inflexible, and employment of foreigners faces barriers. This pattern will broadly persist, although some reforms may be attempted. Meanwhile, informal employment-a common means of avoiding tax, legal obligations and rigidities-will continue to be tolerated to some extent, perpetuating unfair competition, undermining safety standards and hindering productivity gains.
Strengths: The workforce will remain large and young. In 2023 68.3% of the resident population of 85.4m were aged 15-24. Although workforce participation is low at about 53.5% among the resident population in 2023, owing mainly to low female employment and early retirement, this could increase if the labour market tightens. Disruption due to industrial disputes will remain minimal owing to low levels of union membership and militancy, and restrictions on union activity and strikes.
Weaknesses: Participation in higher education has risen, but the quality of public education is likely to remain poor. The policy focus on improving technical education and qualification systems will face challenges in implementation. The best-educated young people will continue to display strong soft and hard skills, including language skills, but may seek work abroad.
What to watch
- Formal unit labour costs may edge upwards. The single national minimum wage is likely to be retained. Although elections are not due until 2028, we expect rises in the minimum wage to be roughly in line with historical inflation, albeit annually-not every six months. In January 2024 the net monthly minimum wage was set at TL17,000 (about US$565 at the time), and the cost to the employer including income tax and social-security contributions was TL23,500. Wages will also be underpinned by shortages of various skills. The lira will not always depreciate sufficiently to keep wages down in terms of major currencies.
- Labour reforms that could facilitate temporary appointments, part-time work and flexible contracts would be controversial but could be attempted. Until now, full-time work with long hours and the full range of legal protection and social benefits has remained the norm in formal employment. The severance pay system, which entitles departing employees to lump-sum payments, could be reformed to ease the burden on employers, although labour union opposition persists. The 45-hour working week may be reduced. Given popular opposition to employing foreigners, except in a few specific capacities, individual work permits will still be required; recognition of qualifications may become easier for specific professions.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries and territories. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: Turkey's infrastructure score stagnates in 2024-28, and its global ranking declines from 50th to 64th. Turkey will rank lower than all developed and central and south-east European countries, as well as many developing countries, and roughly equal to Russia and India. Major investments have been undertaken, particularly in and around Istanbul, but improvements in rail transport, ports, telecommunications and the reliability of the electricity supply have been slow. In the short term investments may be curtailed by fiscal constraints, the need to rebuild infrastructure affected by earthquakes, and unpredictable markets.
Strengths: Major transport projects completed in recent years include the Istanbul Airport and other airports, motorways, Bosporus crossings, and bridges across the Gulf of Izmit and the Dardanelles. Many of these have been built under controversial public-private partnership (PPP) schemes. Most cities are served by air transport, and further improvements wıll include additional capacity at Istanbul's two main airports. Gaps in road infrastructure will persist given the large distances between cities.
Weaknesses: Although road transport dominates, the rail network is limited. Some upgrades will be made, and private operators may be accorded a greater role. Inter-city high-speed rail links will continue to be completed with long delays. Urban rail systems will expand on a piecemeal basis in Istanbul and a few other cities, but an ambitious three-tier undersea tunnel across the Bosporus may be delayed. Urban areas will remain vulnerable to earthquakes and floods, traffic congestion, strains on water supplies, and inadequate waste and sewerage management systems.
What to watch
- In energy, import dependency will persist, and the state's role in gas and power markets will still complicate private investment. The Akkuyu nuclear plant, Turkey's first, will gradually come on stream starting in 2024 or 2025. Work may commence on other nuclear power projects. The share of renewable energy may rise further, depending partly on rainfall for dams, but Turkey will still produce power from coal, use gas as its main heating fuel, and aim to be a transit and trading hub for natural gas from source countries to Europe. Gas storage investments will be completed. The continuity and quality of power supply will remain problematic owing to transmission and distribution issues. Energy efficiency gains will be patchy.
- Mobile telecommunications access is widespread, but speeds are slow. Infrastructure improvements will take time The introduction of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, which has been delayed to allow the development of indigenous technology, could commence with a tender process in 2024 or 2025, but the terms have yet to be decided.
- Canal Istanbul, a favourite project of Mr Erdogan, would link the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, creating a new shipping route. Opposed on environ-mental and feasibility grounds, it is also seen as a means of generating windfall increases in property values. Work will proceed slowly amid financial constraints.

Overview: Turkey's digital readiness will improve in 2024-28, but it remains 36th in the global ranking owing to advances elsewhere. Turkey will trail most Western countries, some central and south-east European countries, and the best performers in emerging Asia and the Gulf, but outscore India, Indonesia, and the rest of the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America.
Strengths: Internet use is widespread and will continue to grow. Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) survey results for 2023 indicate that 95.5% of households had internet access, 87.1% of 16-74 year-olds used the internet, and 49.5% of users had purchased goods or services online in the past 12 months. According to the trade ministry, the share of online sales in total trade reached 18.6% in 2022. E-commerce is well regulated, and legislation, institutional arrangements and international co-operation have been adopted to counter cyber-crime. Regarding the commercial business environment, TurkStat's 2023 survey of firms employing at least ten people showed that 96% had internet access, 92% used a fixed-broadband connection, 40% engaged in innovation and 5.5% used artificial intelligence. All these percentages will increase in the forecast period.
Weaknesses: Despite steady growth, fixed-broadband penetration remained relatively low at 22.8% in the third quarter of 2023, according to the Information and Communication Technologies Authority. Investment in fibre will gradually raise this ratio, along with the average connection speed, although the state-controlled Turk Telekom may retain its near-monopoly on infrastructure. The scope of e-government will broaden only slowly.
What to watch
- The government is emphasising digital transformation, particularly in industry, and offering generous incentives, programmes and projects. Success stories about the use of technology in industry have multiplied. However, the economy as a whole is still quite low on the technology ladder: in January 2024, for example, high-tech industries accounted for 3.5% of manufacturing sector exports and medium-high-technology industries for 36.4%.
- Research and development (R&D) activity, research infrastructure and innovation have grown rapidly in recent years, but this growth may be hard to maintain. TurkStat reports that the ratio of R&D spending to GDP rose from about 0.8% in 2009-13 to 1.4% in 2021, with industry accounting for nearly two-thirds. The number of R&D personnel also rose steadily up to 2021. Turkish Patent and Trademark Office data put domestic patent applications at a record 9,009 in 2022. More recent figures suggest that growth in R&D and patents has paused since 2022, although Turkey still has to catch up with more advanced countries.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The focus in the short term will remain on the dismantling of the unorthodox economic programme that started in 2021. The programme published in September 2023 emphasises the need for economic orthodoxy-including tighter monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms-which will reassure investors. The process of rebalancing the economy will be gradual, in order to prevent potential financial sector problems stemming from high corporate and household debt levels. The new economic programme also promises a floating currency and an inflation-targeting strategy. In several respects, however, the policy framework still does not mark a full return to economic orthodoxy. Some of the existing unorthodox banking regulations will continue to be used alongside the policy rate to control domestic demand. The re-establishment of the one-week repurchase rate as the main monetary policy instrument is not yet complete, as the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) also continues to provide banks with Turkish lira via currency swap deals. Meanwhile, exchange-rate policy is non-transparent. The use of special savings accounts that protect against lira depreciation (known as KKMs) is now being discouraged and will be gradually phased out. However, until then the central bank remains responsible for guaranteeing these foreign-exchange-protected bank accounts and also for extending credit to exporters and investors as well as giving direction to the credits extended by the banks. Meanwhile, fiscal policy remains expansionary ahead of the local elections. Overall, EIU expects the normalisation of day-to-day monetary policy to continue, but the central bank will continue to face political pressure for looser policies and to consider other goals besides price stability.
The main risks are that promised fiscal, monetary and incomes policies are not fully implemented or are reversed for political reasons, as the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has a strong preference for low policy interest rates and loose fiscal policy. Policymakers could also fail to impress potential foreign investors and financiers, endangering the net capital inflows that are needed to offset the current-account deficit and enable Turkey to keep servicing its private- and public-sector foreign debt (about 50% of GDP).
A balance-of-payments crisis will remain a risk over 2024-28. Tighter global monetary conditions and Turkey's high risk premium make it hard for the country to attract sufficient capital inflows to offset its large current-account deficit and roll over its foreign debt. Capital inflows have been improving, and foreign-exchange reserves have picked up since June. Mr Erdogan has been able to shore up Turkey's foreign-exchange reserves through swap and deposit agreements negotiated with non-Western countries. These politically motivated capital inflows, as well as some savings from delayed payments and discounted prices for Russian natural gas, are likely to be extended and augmented. However, they are unpredictable, and investor sentiment will remain fragile. With Turkey unwilling to borrow from multilateral institutions, it will remain highly dependent on these political allies to avoid a potential balance-of-payments crisis.
Uncertainty over Mr Erdogan's commitment to orthodox policies will continue to affect confidence, and the risk of a full-blown economic crisis would rise again if he reintroduced irrational economic policies. Meanwhile, the global outlook presents a downside risk, as it could hamper Turkey's ability to attract financial capital. Geopolitical conflicts and tensions are likely to affect the prospects for trade, finance and tourism. In the event of an economic crisis, capital and import controls could be imposed. Turkey's low public debt levels mean that the government would have room to provide assistance to banks or firms in such a scenario.

Government debt 33.3 34.7 32.5 31.4 30.0 30.1
Although the fiscal deficit will narrow (from an estimated 5% of GDP in 2023 to 4.5% in 2024), it will remain large, partly owing to the costs related to the earthquakes in February 2023. Expansionary policies ahead of the May 2023 and March 2024 elections will also continue to put pressure on the public finances. The administration has increased many taxes, but revenue growth is likely to be hampered by a slowing economy. The costs of government guarantees for the exchange-rate-protected KKM bank accounts would also be substantial, but these are being met by the central bank and not the budget.
We expect the deficit to narrow to an annual average of 3.2% of GDP in 2025-27 as the government reintroduces a more prudent approach to the public finances. The deficit will widen again in 2028, as it is an election year. Government debt is low, at about 30% of GDP in 2023, but two-thirds of this is denominated in foreign currency.

The CBT has now raised rates eight times since reversing Mr Erdogan's policy of ultra-low interest rates, which caused the lira to plummet and prices to soar. The policy was abandoned after his re-election in May 2023. Bank interest rates have risen sharply too, and domestic demand has cooled to some extent. At its February meeting the CBT maintained its main policy rate at 45%. We expect the central bank to keep interest rates on hold until inflation starts to slow in the third quarter of 2024. We expect the CBT to start cutting rates in September and throughout 2025-28, in line with slowing inflation. Nevertheless, real rates will remain negative in 2024-25.
The CBT will continue winding down its interventions in the foreign-exchange market, and unpicking the many regulations that it has imposed on banks to deter the use of foreign currency and control the level and direction of credit. Some quantitative tightening decisions will continue. The CBT has also hinted that some macroprudential measures will be used to keep credit growth sufficiently low and deposit interest rates sufficiently high to reduce inflation. Overall, the adoption of more orthodox monetary policies continues, but in several respects the policy framework is still not rational.

We expect economic growth to slow from an estimated 4.5% in 2023 to about 3% in 2024. This will remain much faster than the OECD average. The long-running consumer boom will come to an end. Initially, the large pay and pension increases announced in January 2024 will boost consumer demand. Still-high public spending will continue to support growth. However, as part of a shift to a more orthodox footing, the government has started to increase taxes and interest rates, and is limiting access to credit, which will have negative implications for consumer spending and government expenditure. Fixed investment will continue to grow (although at more modest pace), reflecting greater confidence about the direction of economic policy.
Economic growth will accelerate again in 2025 in line with falling rates and a recovering global outlook. Growth will average 3.5% in 2025-28, which is close to Turkey's medium-term potential. We expect a slight acceleration in 2028, as it is an election year and we expect Mr Erdogan to resort to his old tactics of promoting faster economic activity for electoral advantage.
In the longer term Turkey will remain a fast-growing economy, given its geographical location, sectoral diversity, appeal as a tourism destination, dynamic private sector and strong population growth. However, several factors expose the economy to external shocks, including its reliance on short-term capital inflows to meet the large external financing requirement, dependence on imported oil and gas, and limited foreign-currency reserves. Furthermore, Turkey's longer-term competitiveness will remain open to question. Talk of structural reforms to improve the attractiveness of the business environment has yet to be put into practice, and the political, administrative and justice systems will remain weak.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends As in most developing countries, the share of agriculture gross value added in nominal GDP has declined steadily in Turkey in recent decades, but, at an estimated 6.4% in 2023, it remains an important sector, especially considering the input it provides to Turkey's food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing industry. In addition, agriculture accounts for a substantial share of goods exports (just under 10%) and of total employment (about 17%), although almost half of those employed in the sector are classified as unpaid family workers. We expect the share of output of the primary sector to remain stable during the forecast period, but it will remain large compared with most other European countries, at 6.4% of GDP in 2028. The sector would benefit from investment in irrigation in the south-east of the country and in some other regions, but investment is likely to remain on hold in areas affected by the conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More generally, the importance of modern, large-scale agricultural enterprises will spread gradually, but the problems of traditional agriculture and unclear policymaking are likely to persist.
Manufacturing will continue to play a central role in the Turkish economy Industry gross value added, including manufacturing, mining and construction, accounted for about 30% of GDP in 2023, in part supported by a weak lira, improving competitiveness on the global market. In 2024-28 we expect growth to remain stable: although base effects will weigh on the sector, it will continue to benefit from the increased competitiveness of the lira and nearshoring trends in Europe reducing the supply-chain disruption risks that emerged during the pandemic.
Construction was a significant driver of economic growth in 2010-17. In this period real gross value added in the sector, which is dominated by housing construction and mega-infrastructure projects, expanded by an average of about 11% per year, following sharp contractions in the previous two years. The pace of housing construction outstripped demand for several years, even after allowing for strong demographically driven growth in the number of households and the continued replacement of existing buildings. Growth was also bolstered by a strong expansion in credit as a result of pressure by the president on banks to lower mortgage rates; the indirect effect of the credit guarantee fund; the relaxation of macro-prudential measures; and ample global international liquidity. Infrastructure and building investments via public-private partnerships, which had picked up significantly, also contributed to robust construction growth. However, the boom in activity resulted in a reported 1.5m-2m new homes being unoccupied, a situation that weakened developers' finances and reduced the incentive for new investments. In 2018-21 construction output plunged, given the oversupply of housing, the high ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the sector, the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar, high interest rates and a sharp slowdown in economic growth in 2018-20. Given continued macroeconomic instability, as well as rising input costs in the industry and expected currency volatility, construction output is likely to be volatile.
Growth is likely to slow in several manufacturing subsectors Several manufacturing subsectors, such as automotive, and textiles and clothing, are strongly export-oriented. They suffered from low export growth in 2020 but remained an important source of foreign export earnings, and rebounded in 2021, reflecting lira weakness and recovering external demand. However, Turkey's manufactured exports are generally also import-intensive. A large portion of the inputs-including energy, intermediates and capital goods-are imported, adding to Turkey's external imbalances, especially when international commodity prices are high or the lira is weak, as it has been since mid-2013. This structural situation is unlikely to change much during the forecast period, as reducing the import intensity of exports and moving up the value-added chain will take time, even though these are explicit goals in the government's investment incentive system, which was introduced in 2012.
In 2021 vehicle production was 29% below record levels in 2017 The automotive industry tends to be Turkey's biggest export, but, after several years of strong growth, domestic and external conditions have become more challenging for the sector. In 2022 the total production of Turkey's automotive industry amounted to 1.4m vehicles, according to the Automotive Manufacturers Association (OSD)-slightly higher than in 2020-21 but broadly flat compared with 2019 and about 20% lower than its peak in 2017, reflecting constrained demand both domestically and in important European markets. Exports of vehicles picked up in 2022, but only moderately, to 988,358, and were still well below the 2017 level (1.3m).
Turkey runs a large trade surplus in its automotive sector. However, conditions are likely to remain challenging in the short and even in the medium term. Global supply-chain disruption caused by the outbreak of war in Ukraine will constrain production. Although domestic policies affecting credit remain favourable, lira weakness and the erosion of purchasing power by rampant price inflation will negatively affect local demand.
Almost 80% of motor vehicles produced in Turkey are exported, and the bulk of these go to the EU (Turkey accounts for almost 30% of vehicles imported by the bloc). As a result, vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe, which we expect to be negatively affected by still-high prices and supply-chain bottlenecks. However, the significant depreciation of the lira against the US dollar and the euro is likely to support export volumes over the medium term. Given its location and its trade agreement with the EU, Turkey will remain an important automotive hub, but political uncertainties will weigh on investor confidence. Over the medium term, considering the growth potential of the automotive market in Turkey and the wider region, manufacturers with production plants in Turkey may start to focus more on the Turkish, Middle Eastern and North African markets. The domestic market will be supported by rising incomes and replacement demand.
Most vehicle manufacturers will maintain facilities in Turkey We believe that most manufacturers will maintain their production facilities in Turkey. These facilities are technologically advanced, and labour costs are much lower in Turkey than in core European countries and most central and east European countries, where wages have risen strongly since accession to the EU. However, if Turkey is to remain a major automotive production location in the medium to long term, manufacturers will have to move away from exporting low-end passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and components to north European markets, and towards developing and producing alternative-energy engines and vehicles. There are signs that this transition is already happening. The market will be supported by cuts in taxes on hybrid and electric vehicles.
The textiles and clothing industries remain important The textiles and clothing industries remain important to the Turkish economy. These industries have undergone restructuring under the intense pressure of competition from low-cost producers in Asia, including China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The government has also been looking at ways to improve investment incentives and target higher-value-added products. These industries suffered from subdued demand in 2020-21 amid the global recession. However, over the medium term a more competitive currency and ample growth potential will underpin robust growth prospects. Competitive pressures from lower-cost centres of production will remain a risk, but this could be offset by European supply chains shifting closer to markets.
Reduced security concerns and lira depreciation will drive tourism growth Tourism, one of the most important services sectors of the Turkish economy-an important source of economic activity, employment and foreign exchange-witnessed rapid growth in the past decade, but is highly vulnerable to geopolitical developments and changes in the exchange rate. Istanbul, the largest city, remains the top destination and accounts for a third of all arrivals. It appears that security concerns are no longer deterring visitors from important markets.
The outbreak of the war in Ukraine and massive earthquakes in Turkey in February 2023 clouded the near-term outlook for the sector, given a decline in tourist arrivals from Russia and Ukraine, which accounted for more than 27% of all foreign visitors in 2021. However, tourism arrivals have recovered, and Turkey should continue to benefit from the weakness of the lira.

Unit labour costs 8.0 0.0 5.8 0.4 4.7 6.2
Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.2 4.3 4.5 4.5 4.7 5.0
We expect inflation to average about 52% in 2024-the highest rate in the OECD-after it averaged 53.9% in 2023. Inflationary pressures remain strong; the CBT has allowed the lira to weaken, and higher government spending and generous pre- and post-election increases in pay and pensions will still support demand and increase costs for businesses. Meanwhile, although they have risen, interest rates are still below inflation, and we expect real rates to remain negative until 2025, which will prevent any significant slowdown in inflation.
Further periodic bouts of lira weakness, persistent inflationary expectations, and high global prices for metals and critical minerals will keep inflation high, at an average of 17.9% per year in 2025-28. Overall, inflation will remain far above historical levels (of about 10%) and well above the central bank's target of 5% in 2024-28.

The CBT seems to have stepped back from currency intervention and appears to be trying to manage a depreciation of the lira towards a more competitive level. Given the economic imbalances that have built up in recent years, there are huge risks to this process. We forecast that the lira will depreciate from an estimated average of TL23.8:US$1 in 2023 to about TL49.7:US$1 in 2028.
Internal and external imbalances, elevated inflation, and tighter monetary policy in the US and the euro area will weigh on the lira, which we expect to keep weakening against the US dollar in 2024-28. The risk of a return to unorthodox domestic policies, poor international relations, foreign investor concerns about the politicisation of the central bank and a reliance on short-term capital inflows will also weigh on the currency. The weak lira not only contributes to inflation but also adds to foreign-debt-servicing costs.

Policy tightening will help to reduce the current-account deficit from 4% of GDP in 2023 to 3.1% in 2024, partly as a result of lower domestic demand. Easing global commodity prices should also curb the rise in import costs. Meanwhile, a still-strong tourism sector and a recovery in external demand will support trade and services exports. After a gradual narrowing to 1.2% of GDP in 2026, the current-account deficit will widen again in 2027-28 ahead of the elections in 2028. Attracting sufficient capital inflows to cover the deficit and service foreign debt without drawdowns of foreign-exchange reserves will remain a challenge.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Turkey Stocks and flows In 2019-20 foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows were subdued, averaging US$8.6bn per year (1.2% of GDP), owing to high economic and policy uncertainty following Turkey's currency crisis in late 2018 and the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. FDI inflows picked up to US$13.2bn (or 1.5% of GDP, the highest since 2015) in 2021-22 as the global economic recovery gathered pace but slowed to US$10.4 (0.9% of GDP) in 2023 in line with the uncertainty surrounding the presidential and parliamentary elections. The stock of inward FDI stood at 23.2% of GDP in 2023 (US$266.4bn)-well below levels in regional competitors such as Romania and Poland (between 40-50% of GDP), and in Bulgaria and Slovakia (75-80%). Turkish outward FDI averaged a low US$3.1bn in 2019-20, presumably owing to high domestic funding needs, before picking up to an average US$5.7bn in 2021-22. It eased again to US$4bn in 2023, in line with higher funding needs.
Origin and distribution The traditional sources of foreign capital in Turkey have been multinational companies based in major European countries, especially the UK, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Germany, and in other OECD countries such as the US, Switzerland and Japan. Individual large investments from several smaller EU countries, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Brazil have amended this pattern in recent years, and there have also been some significant purchases by private-equity funds. A majority of foreign investment appears to go to Istanbul-the commercial capital, where most national Turkish companies have their headquarters. Investment projects of foreign capital companies are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Marmara region (which includes Istanbul), the Aegean region, the Mediterranean and Ankara, the capital. Historically, manufacturing (particularly the chemicals, food and automotive industries) and financial services have attracted the most FDI. Problems in developed economies, and the euro zone crisis in particular, together with the deterioration in economic conditions in Turkey, have led to divestments by foreign financial institutions, many of which entered the Turkish market in 2005-08. As part of a plan to shore up its capital base, the National Bank of Greece has sold its 99.8% stake in Finans Bank, but because the sale, which was completed in mid-2016, was to Qatar National Bank, it did not affect net inward FDI figures in 2016. In 2017 OMV, an Austrian energy group, sold off its 100% stake in Petrol Ofisi, a Turkish petrol retailer. A neutral impact also resulted from the sale of Denizbank by Russia's Sberbank to Emirates NBD, which was completed in July 2019.
Foreign property purchases, which are included in balance-of-payments statistics for FDI, have made a solid contribution to net inflows since 2005. In 2005-13 net inflows averaged a solid US$2.5bn per year, before picking up to an average of US$4.7bn in 2014-21. Amid excess supply, lira weakness and the deteriorating economic outlook, real estate inflows in US dollar terms declined in 2019-20 but have recovered since 2021.
Determinants Foreign investment is mostly motivated by the size and potential of the Turkish market, but also increasingly because it offers access to neighbouring markets. The sharp rise in FDI in 2005-07 was partly driven by favourable global financial conditions, which have since evaporated. However, the upsurge was also made possible by the conjunction of several country-specific factors. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) was more willing than its predecessors to sell majority stakes in state-owned companies to foreigners. The economy was relatively stable and grew strongly, and EU accession talks, which were expected to lead to further reform of the business environment, got under way. The private sector was also more willing to seek foreign partners than in the past. This may have reflected the thinking of a new generation of management, strategies of specialisation in certain sectors, a desire to raise capital for privatisation bids, fear of increasing foreign competition, lost appetite for bank ownership and temptingly high company valuations. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an attempted military coup in July 2016, massive earthquakes in February 2023, and increased social and political polarisation over the shift to a presidential system of government. Other significant structural deterrents, which vary by the sector, size and type of investment, include regulatory uncertainty, a slow and unpredictable judicial system, weak intellectual property (IP) protection, and unfair competition from smuggled goods and the large informal sector. Such determinants are unlikely to change significantly over the forecast period (2024-28), although, in order to attract much-needed FDI inflows, Turkey may start to improve IP protection and clamp down on its large informal sector for tax revenue purposes.
Impact The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is relatively low when compared with other emerging markets such as Brazil or Russia. However, FDI has accumulated over many decades, and the outlook compared with several central and east European countries has improved. Several leading multinationals, such as Unilever (UK-Netherlands) and Ford (US), have had a long-standing presence in Turkey, and companies with foreign partners play a significant role in the economy, helping to spread modern management and business practice. In the automotive industry, foreign investment has ensured expansion, technology transfer and access to global markets, although some lament the lack of national technology or a national trademark and the focus on production of low-end vehicles. In contrast, much recent FDI has taken the form of acquisitions of existing assets in domestically oriented sectors, and has therefore had a limited direct impact on fixed investment or exports. Foreign ownership of banks has not demonstrably improved either access to international funds or services and productivity, which were already advanced, and nor have fears been realised that foreign-owned banks might attach a greater risk premium than local banks to lending to the Turkish government or Turkish companies. The arrival of Vodafone (UK) has gradually helped to increase competition and investment in telecommunications, where Turkcell and Turk Telekom are dominant players. From a macroeconomic perspective, Turkey has relied on capital inflows, including FDI, to cover its large external financing requirement. In the years prior to the 2008-09 crisis, a growing share of FDI in capital inflows comforted the financial markets by reducing the vulnerability of the lira to trends in short-term capital inflows. This ratio declined in 2020 as FDI inflows dried up, picked up in 2021-22-reflecting smaller, albeit still-large, external financing needs-and dried up again in 2023.
Potential EIU's baseline forecast is that, assuming security and policy concerns are addressed during the forecast period, there will be a moderate pick-up driven by further privatisation and other cross-border mergers and acquisitions, as well as foreign interest in residential and commercial property, following the easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in 2012. Private corporations in many sectors may still be open to foreign investment, and several major assets are yet to be privatised. We assume that the government will make further progress in creating conditions for private-sector investment in infrastructure in order to support economic growth over the longer term. The energy sector in particular has the potential to attract large amounts of foreign investment. Existing investors are likely to increase their investment through further acquisitions or projects, and some greenfield investment may take place. Subdued income growth may dampen foreign investors' earlier interest in retailing, but they may also become more active in other services, such as tourism, as well as in mining and agriculture. Investors from Asia and parts of the Middle East may play a larger role, in addition to Western multinationals and funds.

Population growth remains high by European standards Turkey is the third-largest country by population in Europe, after Russia and Germany. Official population figures have been compiled using an address-based registry since 2009. These figures are lower than previous estimates from door-to-door censuses, but are believed to be more reliable. The total population is projected to rise from 85.8m in 2023 to 88m in 2028, with the female population continuing to grow and equalling that of males in 2028. The total population is expected to grow by 0.5% per year during the forecast period (2024-28), compared with 0.7% during the historical period (2019-23). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of urbanisation, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards, and the average age remains one of the lowest, at an estimated 33.5 years in 2023.
Infant mortality will continue to decline, but will be high From an average of 14.8 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2019-23, the crude birth rate is expected to fall to an average of 13.3 per 1,000 in 2024-28. The infant mortality rate will continue to decline but will remain high compared with European countries, as the national average is pulled up by the south-eastern and eastern regions, as well as by rural areas. The crude death rate will remain broadly unchanged, at an average of 5.4 per 1,000 population in 2024-28.
Although ageing, the Turkish population is young in a European context and will remain so throughout the forecast period. In 2023 those aged 14 and under comprised an estimated 23% of the total population, and the 65-plus age group accounted for just 8.9%. In 2028 the share of under-15s will remain high, at 21.4%, and over-65s are expected to account for 10.7% of the population.
The urban population will rise further owing to better conditions in cities The urban population, which was estimated at 77.5% in 2023, will rise further as rural families, insufficiently supported by agriculture, continue to seek better living standards in towns and cities. The drift from smaller and poorer urban settlements to larger and richer ones will also continue. As a result, all major cities in the west and south (including Ankara, the capital) will continue to grow rapidly. Although earthquake-prone, Istanbul and its surrounding area is likely to become the largest conurbation in Europe-the population was about 15.5m at end-2023, up from about 12.6m at end-2007. Other cities and towns to witness particularly strong population growth include prosperous industrial centres like Bursa and Konya, and Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast.
The population of the mostly Kurdish-inhabited south-east, which accounts for about 10% of the total population, has increased steadily, despite strong outward migration, but will be impacted by the massive earthquakes that hit the region in February 2023. The still-high natural population growth rate in the region will contribute to the rapid expansion of the populations of cities like Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. By contrast, the populations of many rural areas in northern, eastern and central Turkey will dwindle. Even some of the larger urban centres in these poorer and more remote regions could lose population as birth rates slow and migration westward and southward continues. Some western and southern areas that are still classed as rural may maintain their populations as a result of intensive agriculture, tourism and/or proximity to major cities. This may also be true of lowland parts of the south-east that benefit from irrigation schemes.
Participation rates will remain well below the OECD average Despite solid growth in the working-age population, Turkey has the lowest labour force participation rate of any OECD country. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), it averaged 53.5% in December 2023 (about 70% for men and 35% for women), compared with an OECD average of more than 70%. Participation rates in urban areas are lower than in rural areas, reflecting the fact that rural women are typically classified as "unpaid family workers" and are, therefore, counted as workforce participants and employed persons. Low workforce participation rates among urban women probably reflect inadequate job opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender roles. This situation is changing slowly, as illustrated by a gradual rise in recent years in the urban female participation rate. However, the rate is expected to remain low by European standards throughout the forecast period.

Overall spending power will rise, but income distribution will remain uneven The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local-currency terms, although since late 2021 lira weakness and rampant inflation have eroded households' spending power. In 2023 GDP per head was US$13,389 at market exchange rates, up from US$10,522 in 2022, and US$39,753 at purchasing power parity (PPP), up from US$36,910 in 2022. EIU expects GDP per head to reach US$51,477 at PPP in 2028. Thereafter, GDP per head in Turkey will remain broadly unchanged, at about 65% of the EU average. Relative to other emerging markets, at PPP rates Turkey's GDP per head is broadly in line with that of Russia, above that of Brazil and China, and below that of Romania.
Income distribution is uneven by European standards. According to the survey of incomes and living conditions by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the highest-earning 20% of households accounted for 48% of total income in 2022 (latest available data), up from 45.9% in 2014; the lowest-earning 20% of households accounted for 6%, down from 6.2% in 2014. Geographical factors contributed to the discrepancies. In general, the regions with the highest and most rapidly growing concentrations of population were also the wealthiest regions, except in the south-east, where spending power is low, partly as a result of continued confrontation between the central government and the Kurdish forces. Greater Istanbul, which accounts for about 20% of the population, represents about 25% of household consumption expenditure. By contrast, the statistical region of south-east Anatolia, with about 10% of the population, generated only about 6% of household consumption. Income and consumer expenditure also vary widely between urban and rural areas. These patterns are unlikely to change significantly in the forecast period (2024-28).
The household will remain the main consumption unit. Households typically consisted of an average of 3.2 people in 2022, and more than 90% of households are made up of married couples. These patterns will change only slowly; the number of households will tend to rise faster than the population, underpinning medium-term demand for housing construction and household durables.
A majority of Turkish consumers aspire to a Western-style consumer society A large majority of consumers aspire to a "Western-style" consumer society, in so far as their incomes permit, although local factors affect lifestyle aspirations. The country has wide variations in geography and climate, which affect diet, leisure activities and demand for certain goods.

The proportion of total household spending allocated to food, beverages and tobacco is high. The wealthiest households, which enjoy standards of living close to those in western Europe, spend significant amounts on entertainment, education and catering, as well as on transport, because of the high cost of running a car. These households will remain an important target market for environment-friendly and wellness products and services, which are relatively new. Other population segments are starting to provide additional demand for items that have been the prerogative of upper-income groups. Rising car ownership will continue to encourage supermarket shopping, residence in suburban areas and related lifestyle trends. Demand for branded fashion items, fast food, air conditioning and holidays is also spreading. The fact that about half of the population is under 35 will encourage the introduction of new products and services in communications, information and entertainment technology. Tourists constitute a significant addition to the consumer market. Assuming that perceived security risk does not increase again in the coming years, we expect the weaker lira to boost arrivals as the risks associated with the February 2023 earthquakes abate.

Initial conditions: Some of the obstacles to solid and stable growth were removed in the decade to 2010, but in recent years the government has pursued unorthodox policies, and focused on domestic power struggles and the foreign policy challenges arising from turmoil in the wider region. This has put economic reforms designed to boost investment and employment on hold. Given the deterioration of Turkey's institutions of governance, EIU expects only limited progress on reforms in the near term, damaging Turkey's longer-term growth potential. For similar reasons, we do not expect Turkey's EU membership bid to make significant progress, making accession a remote prospect, even under a new government (which we deem a less likely scenario). A relatively low level of skills and quality of the workforce compared with Turkey's main competitors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in central and eastern Europe will continue to act as a deterrent to FDI, although Turkey will enjoy substantially more favourable demographics for much of the long-term forecast period (2024-50).
Working-age population growth will turn negative in 2040 Demographic trends: On current projections, Turkey will have the second-largest national population in Europe (after Russia) by 2050, and, unlike in most European economies, the working-age population will continue to grow until the late 2030s. However, it will shrink thereafter as the country's demographic dynamic starts to deteriorate in the 2040s. In 2024-30 the difference between growth in the working-age population and that of the total population will be close to zero, before turning more strongly negative in 2031-50, which will dampen economic growth. This trend could be delayed if the bulk of the 3.6m Syrian refugees currently being hosted in Turkey are integrated into the population, but anti-immigrant sentiment has increased, and the government is hoping to persuade at least 1m refugees to return to Syria in the near future. Throughout the long-term forecast period, we expect an upward trend in the labour force and employment as a result of rising participation rates, given the low starting levels. With the workforce continuing to expand at a steady rate, it will be a challenge to produce sufficient jobs to lower the unemployment rate.
External conditions: International developments-particularly in international financial markets, the EU (Turkey's main export market) and in global terms of trade-will continue to affect the country's long-term economic performance. The Ukraine crisis may result in increased risk aversion among investors over the long term, boding ill for Turkey, which relies heavily on attracting capital inflows to support growth. We expect export-led industries to play an increasing role in growth. Turkey would benefit from greater global trade liberalisation, but the process of liberalisation is faltering, and trade flows have slowed. Over the long term Turkey may benefit from nearshoring trends. As a supplier of the developed economies, Turkey will face intense global competition, as low- and medium-value-added manufactured goods are likely to remain its main product lines. Its technology potential is relatively limited, and the country is not well placed to become a major supplier of services other than tourism and, to a lesser extent, construction, although improvements in (and diversification of) the domestic financial sector over the past decade may enable Turkey to develop as a provider of banking and insurance services in the wider region. Owing to completed and planned pipeline construction, Turkey has been developing into a major energy hub between Russia, the Caspian region and western Europe. However, the need to drastically reduce global consumption of fossil fuels, tensions with Greece and Cyprus over gas exploration in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean, and the introduction of severe financial and economic sanctions against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine have clouded the outlook. Turkey is itself heavily dependent on imported oil and gas from Russia, and much greater investment and co-operation with the EU would be needed if Turkey were to become a real alternative to Russian supplies. As Turkey shares borders with countries such as Iran, Syria and Iraq, its immediate regional environment is challenging, in particular from a security perspective.
Problems in the EU will dampen Turkey's interest in membership We do not expect Turkey to join the EU in our long-term forecast period, and there is a high probability that the accession negotiations may even be abandoned by one or both sides in this period. Given the limited progress so far in its accession talks, the strength of public opposition in most EU member states to Turkish membership, and the economic and political challenges still facing the EU, we believe that Turkey's commitment to the goal of full EU membership will diminish even further. This increases the risk that government commitment to political and economic reform will weaken further. Harmonisation of Turkey's domestic legislation with EU norms is significantly more important for Turkey's long-term economic stability than actual membership. If the EU were to loosen its structure, opposition within the bloc to Turkish accession might ease, increasing Turkey's chances of joining. However, this is not our core forecast.
Institutions and policy trends: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's victory in Turkey's first direct presidential election in August 2014, followed by the transition from a parliamentary system of government to an executive presidency and his re-election in 2018 and in 2023, has major implications for the country's future institutional and policy-setting framework. The constitution currently does not allow Mr Erdogan to run again for president when his current term ends in 2028. However, there is a high likelihood that discussions around a new constitution would include processes to allow him to stay in power beyond 2028. The issue of Mr Erdogan's succession as leader of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and president of the country could become a source of instability during the long-term forecast period.
There is considerable risk that economic policy will be increasingly political The government has started a shift towards rational economic policy after years of unorthodox policies. However, economic policy will continue to be tailored to political purposes rather than to maintaining macroeconomic stability and further improvement of the business environment. This means that uncertainty surrounding the commitment of the government to rational economic policy will remain high. Nevertheless, Turkey's public finances are structurally sounder following a decade of IMF-backed reforms in 1999-2008, which may allow the government more room to increase public investment in infrastructure and possibly to reduce tax rates. Given the little progress that we expect to be made in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the problems of unpredictability and inefficiency in the country's legal and regulatory environment are expected to continue beyond 2027. Mr Erdogan's assertive approach to foreign relations is likely to limit the influence of international bodies, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, over the direction of policy.
The government's peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed following the June 2015 election, and neither the PKK nor Mr Erdogan have shown any indication that they are willing to revive them any time soon. If the situation continues on its current trajectory, there is a real risk that the PKK and its affiliates will spread the conflict from the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited south-east of the country to Turkey's main cities in central and western regions, where the Kurdish population has grown rapidly in recent years. The mounting death toll would probably encourage Mr Erdogan to resort to increasingly authoritarian means to retain control.
Long-term performance: Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to exceed that of other emerging markets as a result of its more favourable demographic profile, alongside large increases in productivity. However, at a forecast average of 2.9% a year in 2024-50, real GDP growth will be well below the average growth of 4.8% per year recorded in 2000-20. Average growth in GDP per head will be lower, reflecting the expected rise in the population. Income levels will remain well below the EU27 average, but some catch-up is likely. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but the changes in the political environment have created significant downside risks to the implementation of the necessary reforms.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Global land and ocean temperatures have been rising rapidly since the 1980s, a trend that is widely attributed to growing greenhouse gas emissions from expanding human activity and population. This rise in average temperatures implies a higher number of extremely hot days in the summer period, as well as higher minimum temperatures that will lead to greater electricity consumption and a heavier burden on health services due to temperature-related illnesses and parasitic diseases that thrive in warmer climates.
Precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean has been declining steadily over the past decades and is expected to continue to fall, raising the probability of extremely dry spells of weather. In 1998-2012 the eastern Mediterranean Levant (Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey) experienced the worst drought in 900 years. In Turkey, in 2007 this resulted in water restrictions being imposed in the capital, Ankara, with some residents losing access for up to ten days. It also resulted in Turkey's agricultural output contracting by nearly 7% year on year and the government having to provide grants to affected farmers to compensate for the losses. In the future limited average rainfall is likely to be accompanied by torrential precipitation, such as that in 2018-19, with devastating consequences for infrastructure and agricultural output.
The government has recently taken some steps to mitigate the weakness posed by the country's geographical location. In 2010 it established a national climate change strategy that included improved disaster mitigation plans and improved efficiency in water management. Specifically, a substantial number of dams have been built, and efforts have been made to improve some of the highly inefficient irrigation and water supply systems. Although such measures may help to mitigate the effects of climate change, they may also create foreign policy challenges. The construction of several dams along the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, which feed water into Iraq and Syria, has the potential to increase significantly tensions with these neighbouring countries. In 2019 EIU developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we expect that, despite mitigation efforts, Turkey's real GDP will be 2.8% smaller by 2050 than it would otherwise have been.
Technological development The integration of advanced technologies in Turkey's economy is proceeding at a fast pace, but from a relatively low base. E-commerce, computer ownership and internet access have increased rapidly in the past decade. Yet, despite this progress, Turkey remains far behind the technological frontier. In EIU's business environment rankings, Turkey ranks 42nd in the global ranking for technological readiness. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019 (the comparative country ranking was paused in the 2020 report), Turkey ranks 61st overall, but 69th in terms of information and communications technology (ICT) adoption, which includes criteria such as the percentage of internet users. The country ranks just 64th in internet usage and 59th in fixed-broadband technologies.
Across sectors, large, export-oriented private-sector firms tend to be the most technologically intensive. Firms in the automotive sector, usually structured as joint partnerships between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, are a major driver of research and development (R&D) expenditure. Ford Otosan, the joint venture of Ford (US) in Turkey, has become a global hub for the carmaker's commercial vehicle development and output. In 2015 the company opened a US$25m R&D unit-Turkey's largest, employing about 1,500 engineers. Oyak-Renault, a joint venture between Renault (France) and Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund, won government financial support worth US$100m to support hybrid investments at its Bursa plant.
Turkey's technological prospects are unclear. The country has a young, dynamic labour pool, but its education system is inadequate at providing the skills demanded by employers. In fact, this is regularly one of businesses' top complaints. In addition, in recent years many of Turkey's most educated young people have emigrated abroad, which will make attracting top foreign talent and further foreign direct investment (FDI) more difficult.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. EIU's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries and territories covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2019-23) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2024-28). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2019-23. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2024-28 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries and territories falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries and territories in adjacent quintiles. The 2019-23 ranges are then used to derive 2024-28 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2024-28, not to the likely situation in 2028 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2021 or 2026). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Bola Tinubu, who took office as president at end-May, quickly embarked on a series of pro-market reforms, including the floating of the naira and an end to a costly petrol subsidy (which has since been partly reversed). Although welcomed by investors and multilateral creditors, the moves have received a hostile reception from labour unions and the wider public. Mr Tinubu will focus in his first term on trying to conserve these policies (with mixed success) rather than broadening the push towards a less statist economic model. Insecurity will be rampant, with the security forces unable to overcome multiple security crises in different parts of the country.
- An implicit petrol subsidy has already returned, but EIU expects deregulation of the market from late 2024, once a new mega-refinery ramps up production to a scale that will allow the elimination of fuel imports. On the exchange rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria has moved towards a full float, but traders will be wary of any backsliding on this. Foreign reserves will remain under pressure.
- Inflation will remain well above the 6-9% target range throughout the 2024-28 forecast period. The central bank's pro-growth slant, combined with inflationary market reforms, will sustain especially forceful price pressures early in this period. However, we expect budget reforms under Mr Tinubu to reduce reliance on central bank finance, lowering what had been rapid growth in the money supply under his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari.
- Fiscal savings due to cuts to the petrol subsidy will be redirected towards higher civil servant salaries (to placate unions) and infrastructure. Mr Tinubu is expected to run an expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate growth, resulting in large budget deficits (by Nigerian standards) throughout the forecast period.
- Economic growth will stay well below potential in 2024-28, reaching a peak of 3.5% in 2025 as a tight monetary policy is unwound. Extreme insecurity, a highly challenging business environment and a giant infrastructure gap will be the main constraints on growth.
- We expect the current-account surplus to widen in 2024-25 as petrol import volumes decline and as large currency devaluation takes its toll on import spending. The surplus will narrow from 2026 as global oil prices continue to slide and the trade balance narrows sharply.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens in 2024-28, as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, Nigeria's global ranking remains poor and the regional ranking falls.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Policy is aimed at being pro-business, and some effort is made to move away from protectionism.
2026-28: The non-oil sector is largely shielded from external competition, but NNPC Limited, the state oil company, prepares for partial privatisation (probably through an initial public offering).
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: The exchange-rate unification brings in more foreign direct investment, but the impact is minor in the absence of wider reforms.
2026-28: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, but concerted efforts are made to commercialise the national oil company (which is in joint ventures with multinationals).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Current-account restrictions are eased and progress is made in clearing a backlog of foreign-exchange orders.
2026-28: Foreign-exchange shortages re-emerge as oil prices slide, heightening the risk of capital controls and other convertibility restrictions.
Taxes 2024-25: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, accompanied by tax increases, even though the weak state of the economy, amid hard-biting economic reforms and a high cost of living, weighs on enforcement.
2026-28: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is raised from 7.5% to 15% to cut the budget deficit and manage debt-service costs.
Financing 2024-25: The government seeks liquidity support from multinationals, but the international capital market remains off limits for the sovereign until 2025. A large budget deficit crowds out private-sector lending.
2026-28: Higher tax revenue limits recourse to fiscal deficit financing via central bank overdrafts.
The labour market 2024-25: Employers face major problems, lay off staff to reduce costs and raise wages to compensate for a sharp rise in the cost of living to retain highly skilled employees.
2026-28: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff and face high costs from retaining skilled workers. Unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2024-25: A large private refinery starts operating, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependence on imported petrol.
2026-28: Public investment in infrastructure lags budgeted levels and the rate needed to plug the infrastructure gap.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2026-28: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010 his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second and final term in early 2019. In the February 2023 election the presidency was won by Bola Tinubu, who ran on the ruling party ticket.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) was the predominant political force until the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress (APC). With Mr Buhari at the helm, the APC had enough heft to take power in 2015, secure re-election in 2019 and win again in 2023 under Mr Tinubu.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and high unemployment.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, amendments to consumer taxes, specifically value-added tax (VAT, 7.5% currently), are likely.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. Massive infrastructure deficiencies have rendered the non-oil export base globally uncompetitive. The launch of the Dangote oil refinery will reduce petroleum imports and lead to more exports of refined products. The large currency devaluation will also weigh on imports, keeping the current account in surplus in 2024-28.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability EIU expects Nigeria's president, Bola Tinubu, to remain in power until at least 2027, when his first term ends, but his time in office will be highly testing owing to his weak mandate. Only 8.8m Nigerians voted for him, out of a population estimated at just over 220m. Despite his low popularity, Mr Tinubu has embarked on the biggest economic shake-up of a generation, rapidly rolling out market reforms and dismantling vehicles for patronage and corruption. In theory, these reforms would put Nigeria on a higher growth path, but the hasty adjustment poses major risks to political stability.
Mr Tinubu came to power amid pre-existing high inflation, but quickly moved to deregulate petrol prices and float the currency, intensifying cost-of-living pressures. Given threats of mass industrial action on a scale not seen since 2012, his administration has had to compromise and backtrack in some areas, notably petrol subsidies. Facing pressure from labour unions, Mr Tinubu is reluctant to take a firm stance and risk nationwide strikes and weakening the economy; nevertheless, the fiscal deficit is such that taxes may be increased to repair weak public finances.
Dissatisfaction with economic policy is compounded by widespread, entrenched poverty and ethno-religious divides (stemming from largely unsolvable issues such as high population growth and natural resource depletion) put Nigeria's federal structure at risk. Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province, two Islamist terrorist groups, will present an ongoing threat in the north-east and parts of central Nigeria, and tension between farmers and herdsmen in the Middle Belt agricultural heartland is another source of violent conflict. With the security forces overstretched, emergencies will be triaged and resources deployed to the most pressing. In recent years banditry and kidnapping in the north-east have become a destabilising national crisis. The perpetrators are well funded, and have been developing links with terrorist groups and expanding the reach of their operations. In the oil-producing Niger Delta, distrust of the government runs deep and communities feel that they do not get their fair share of Nigeria's oil wealth. Criminal activity linked to militant groups will continue to disrupt oil production and exports, at times heavily so.
Our baseline assumption is that Nigeria's federal government will assert control over "core" areas such as Abuja, the capital, and other places of political importance, at the expense of "periphery" regions that have long been mired in conflict. This will be enough to keep the seat of power safe, but governance will be minimal across much of the country.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch The next presidential election is due in 2027. Nigeria has a highly fractured party political system, where party allegiances are more often a matter of political convenience than ideology. The fact that Mr Tinubu won the 2023 presidential election in the first round with only 36.6% of the popular vote highlights disenchantment with the major parties. The president's party, the APC, won a majority in the Senate (the upper house) and the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives (the lower house). The third-placed candidate, Peter Obi, who stood for the Labour Party and won 25.4% of the vote, sought to capitalise on popular dissatisfaction. We believe that Mr Obi will be a more formidable force in politics and pose a greater challenge to Mr Tinubu at the next presidential election in 2027.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Given its size, Nigeria is a major player in Africa, but domestic security challenges will reduce its ability to contribute troops to regional military forces as it has done in the past, when the country underwrote regional security. The Senate refused Mr Tinubu's proposal to intervene militarily in Niger following a coup in July 2023. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Nigeria in January 2024, when the two countries agreed on the need to strengthen democracy in West Africa and oppose external influence from countries supporting military juntas in the region (such as Russia), but Nigeria also asked the US to secure a ceasefire in Palestine. The US has been a major arms supplier to Nigeria and is likely to maintain some security assistance, given the wider regional threats posed by Islamist radical groups.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends Mr Tinubu's government has attempted to introduce the kind of free-market reforms that would be necessary if Nigeria were to be placed on a higher growth path, but has so far failed to form a coherent plan. Petrol subsidies were initially scrapped, but in October the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association stated that these had been surreptitiously restored. The Dangote refinery, which began production in January 2024, will not cover domestic fuel needs until late this year, and is in any case importing US crude oil for processing, given competitive US prices. The government's counter-inflationary strategy remains hampered by deeply negative interest rates. A large devaluation of the naira was implemented in early February, effectively eliminating the gap between the official rate and the parallel market rate. This is a positive move, but one that will-at least initially-support high levels of inflation, raising the risk of backsliding on the market-driven exchange-rate policy.
The naira devaluation may turn out to be a turning point in Nigeria's reform drive. When Mr Tinubu came to power in May 2023, the naira was trading at about N461:US$1, diverging sharply from the parallel market rate and leading to a shortage of hard currency as foreign investors struggled to covert naira to US dollars. The currency had depreciated to about N899:US$1 by end-January. Following the introduction of a new system of calculating the naira's official daily rate, on February 6th the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reported the currency's central value at N1,418:US$1. At end-January, with one day's notice, the government forced commercial banks to sell their speculative hard currency holdings, and some of the backlog in unpaid dollar transactions has been addressed. These moves suggest that the new currency system could become a genuine currency float, and one that would encourage foreign investment and portfolio inflows, eventually rectifying the hard currency liquidity shortage.
The government has already reported a sharp rise in daily transaction volumes on the foreign exchanges. However, we believe that all areas of government policy will need to align. In mid-January Nigeria took out a US$3.3bn loan from the African Export-Import Bank, secured on oil revenue in a so-called crude oil prepayment facility. This follows a US$1bn loan from the African Development Bank in November. The country is now seeking a US$1.5bn loan from the World Bank. Considering that an audit of the central bank in August-the first since 2018-showed that out of US$33bn in foreign reserves, nearly US$20bn was committed to a number of derivative deals, Nigeria has a much lower level of unencumbered reserves than initial figures indicate. Traders' confidence in the new currency system will remain low for some time, as new controls could be imposed at any point. However, all of these moves reflect economic necessity rather than policy conviction, and we do not believe that the government will be willing to undertake the deep economic and institutional reforms required to put Nigeria on a more sustainable economic footing.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy We expect a relatively wide budget deficit as a consequence of Mr Tinubu's "fiscally active" job-creation and infrastructure spending agenda. The 2024 budget includes a large increase in non-debt recurrent spending as savings from higher pump prices (reduced by the covert subsidy) are recommitted to higher public-sector salaries and cash transfers to poor households, supplemented by higher borrowing. We expect the subsidy reform to have little net effect on the fiscal balance. We forecast a fiscal deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2024, marginally wider than our estimate for 2023. Deficits are projected to average 4.8% of GDP in 2025-28, which exceeds the legal limit of 3% of GDP and translates into an unusually lax era for fiscal policy in Nigeria. Debt service, and social and job-creation projects will underpin the highest spending/GDP ratio since the 1990s. We expect this to be funded by incremental increases in value-added tax (VAT) from 7.5% to 15% by 2027, which will narrow the deficit from the 2024 level.
Rising public debt means that Mr Tinubu is expected to alter the way that budgets are formulated and, as part of the process, overhaul annual borrowing limits, as hinted in his manifesto. Doing so would permit the government to turn to the debt market rather than rely on the CBN when revenue underperforms and budget deficits exceed the target. Inclusion of past deficit monetisation in the officially reported debt stock and an expected rise in formal borrowing will cause the public debt/GDP ratio to rise quickly over 2024-28. A statutory 40% ceiling will be breached by end-2024, and public debt will reach 52.3% of GDP at end-2028, from less than 20% as recently as end-2022.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy The CBN's weak independence has long prevented a concerted effort to tackle inflation, and monetary policy has arguably become more incoherent under Mr Tinubu, who has publicly expressed a desire for lower interest rates. The CBN has not held a monetary policy committee (MPC) since July 2023, when the policy rate was raised by 25 basis points to 18.75%. A number of MPC meetings have been cancelled since then, despite the fact that interest rates are now highly negative in real terms as inflation soars, reaching a 27-year high of 28.9% year on year in December 2023. Given the rise in inflation, we believe that the CBN will have little choice but to raise rates more sharply when the MPC next meets, on February 26th-27th. Our forecast is that the monetary policy rate will be raised by 300 basis points to 21.75% by year-end; however, we do not expect the CBN to deliver a positive real short-term interest rate in 2024 or thereafter, and there is a risk of even greater passivity than we expect. The MPC attaches a large weight to economic growth, and policy will be subject to political interference. We expect that the first rate cuts will be in 2025, when disinflation and monetary easing in advanced markets will have set in, and that the policy rate will fall to 12.5% by 2026 and stay there until 2028.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth Real GDP growth will slide from an estimated 2.8% in 2023 to 2.2% in 2024. This reflects the surge in already high inflation, the likelihood of monetary tightening and the impact of these two factors on domestic demand. Given population growth of about 2.5% a year, this will amount to a decline in GDP per head. Net exports will be the sole growth driver in 2024, supported by the constraining impact on imports of the recent large currency devaluation. We expect oil export volumes to increase as security in the Niger Delta allows higher oil output and the Dangote refinery exports products and displaces some fuel imports. As inflation falls and monetary policy becomes expansionary from 2025, domestic demand will return to (low) growth. Consequently, real GDP growth will rise to 3.5% in 2025-the highest rate since 2014, owing partly to rebound effects-and average 3.4% in 2026-28. Factors such as power outages, rampant insecurity, a lack of land titling and a giant infrastructure gap will hold back the economy.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation Consumer price inflation reached a recent peak of 28.9% year on year in December. Given the pace of month-on-month increases in prices, deeply negative real interest rates and the large currency devaluation implemented in early February, annual average inflation will climb further in 2024, to average of 28.5%, from an annual rate of 24.7% in 2023. As petrol price increases and the recent large currency devaluation fall out of the year-on-year comparison, in line with lower imported inflation, inflation will gradually be reined in, falling to 20.7% in 2025 and 11.7% by 2028. Inflation will thus remain well above the 7-9% target range throughout the forecast period.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates Persistently high inflation, incoherent monetary policy, low foreign reserves and lingering de facto capital controls will continue to sap confidence in the apparent near-float of the naira implemented in February 2024. Traders will continue to be concerned that controls on the currency could be tightened at any point. An important factor in supporting the new exchange-rate system will be its impact on foreign-exchange reserves. The government has pointed to a rise in daily foreign-exchange transactions in early February, but this partly reflects the forced sell-off of foreign-currency holdings by commercial banks and the meeting of part of the backlog of US dollar transactions. Over the longer term, the oil sector's ability to ramp up production will be important in improving foreign reserve levels and confidence in the naira.
The evidence from early February is that the naira will remain highly volatile for some time, and, in view of rocketing inflation, we believe that it will decline from N1,418:US$1 on February 6th to N1,571:US$1 by year-end. This assumption factors in a gradual reining-in of the pace of monthly depreciation. High inflation will continue to depress the currency, although the pace of depreciation will slow. As a consequence, the naira will end 2028 at N2,199:US$1. The gap with the parallel market rate was effectively eliminated recently. If Nigeria stays the course with a more market-determined exchange rate, dollar liquidity will decline, but investment and portfolio inflows will depend on more than the exchange rate, and will require wider improvements in the business environment, keeping the currency weak for some time.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector The huge devaluation of the naira will encourage exports and discourage imports, resulting in a significant current-account surplus in 2024-26; we forecast that it will stand at 6.2% of GDP in 2024 (up from 2.2% of GDP in 2023) and decline to 1.6% of GDP by 2028. As the Dangote refinery ramps up output, imports of fuel will fall (although not to a point of elimination, as the bulk of petrol is likely to remain imported) and some output from the refinery will be exported. Falling international oil prices will take their toll on the trade balance in the latter years of the forecast period, outweighing incremental increases in crude production. Given growing domestic demand, which will suck in imports, the trade surplus will narrow rapidly. The current-account surplus will follow suit as structural primary income and service deficits outweigh a smaller trade surplus. We expect remittances to remain high as the economy strengthens in the medium to long term. Foreign-exchange reserves will gradually build over the forecast period, aided by the market-driven exchange-rate system, but they will still afford only about 7.8 months of import cover in 2028.

Full text: - Cuba's economy is heavily state-managed and relies on tourism and healthcare services exports for inflows of foreign currency. An inflationary shock stemming from a foreign-exchange shortage and a 2021 currency reform is forcing fiscal restraint and reforms.
- The weak state of Cuba's economy will keep the risk of social unrest high, but EIU believes that regime change is unlikely in the 2024-28 forecast period. The ruling Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) will have to contend with stronger public pressure, but its hold on power will not come under significant threat.
- The ongoing shift from a centrally planned to a mixed economy will be unhurried over the medium term. The government will gradually introduce piecemeal liberalising measures but will retain an interventionist and erratic approach in many areas of policymaking.
- Cuba's economic recovery from recession in 2020-21 will remain slow owing to fiscal retrenchment, an ongoing energy crisis and subdued tourism demand. Real GDP will not return to pre-pandemic levels until after 2025. We expect growth-enhancing reforms and private-sector-led investment to spur greater economic dynamism in 2026-28.
- Cautious liberalising economic measures in 2024-28 will include legal and institutional adjustments as new businesses emerge from the opening-up to private firms, a process that began in 2021.
- Inflation will ease only gradually. The resulting economic dislocation will continue to disrupt activity and perpetuate uncertainty and hardship, but the restructuring of relative prices will eventually boost competitiveness and increase efficiency.
- We expect increased export competitiveness, a gradual recovery in tourism and remittances and an expansion of the private sector to strengthen the current-account position over the forecast period.

- Decentralising economic reforms and infrastructure enhancements will gradually improve the investment climate, helping to lift Cuba's score in 2024-28. However, strict state controls will hamper market opportunities. Cuba remains one of the lowest-ranked countries and is ahead of only Venezuela regionally.

Country forecast overview: Cuba's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Despite government efforts to spur growth, limited access to imports, legal uncertainty and stringent regulations weigh on investor confidence.
2026-28: Private business dynamics improve as institutions strengthen, but regulatory environment remains burdensome.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: Investor interest remains muted owing to price instability, weak domestic demand and government-controlled nature of Cuba's economy.
2026-28: Investor confidence improves as US restrictions on Cuba ease. Options for investment in production for domestic market expand, but tight government controls act as a disincentive.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: State control of transactions persists, forcing new private-sector actors to rely on informal exchange markets.
2026-28: Import capacity improves as Cuban peso strengthens, US sanctions ease slightly and tourism picks up. Foreign-exchange controls adjust to allow some flexibility, bringing official rates into closer alignment with market levels.
Taxes 2024-25: Tax collection from local firms improves, but strong activity in informal exchange market hampers progress. Capacity to collect income tax from state workers increases.
2026-28: Tax incentives support emergence of new industrial cluster in Mariel Special Development Zone.
Financing 2024-25: Debt-service burden eases as Cuba reschedules some debt obligations, but US sanctions still block access to international finance. Banking sector activity expands, but foreign-exchange shortages keep lending growth slow.
2026-28: Banco Central de Cuba (the central bank) accelerates development of domestic financial sector to expand credit instruments, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The labour market 2024-25: New private companies absorb former public-sector workers. Flat wage structure in state sector encourages professional staff and skilled workers to move to private sector.
2026-28: Reforms facilitate greater labour mobility and productivity growth. Labour migration from public sector to more lucrative private sector prompts wage rises for senior staff in public sector.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Telecoms infrastructure improves, but investment in new tourism projects slows owing to high borrowing costs.
2026-28: Increased state investment and foreign financing help to update energy, transport and basic services infrastructure.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Public access to internet expands. State administration and enterprises adopt new technologies.
2026-28: Access to internet services continues to expand, but connection speeds remain below international standards.

a EIU estimates. b Actual.
Background: Cuba has been a communist, one-party state since Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed military government in 1959. Mr Castro's firm alliance with the Soviet bloc caused relations with the US to sour, leading to the suspension of diplomatic ties and the imposition of trade sanctions in 1961. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced Cuba to reintegrate into the global economy. A rapprochement with the US in 2014-17 (which involved an easing of some restrictions) ended under Donald Trump (2017-21). Some restrictions have been lifted under the current US president, Joe Biden, and EIU expects a further (albeit gradual) easing of US sanctions in the 2024-28 forecast period.
Political structure: The Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) is the only legal political party. Leaders of the 1959 revolution still hold top positions, but a generational transition is under way. The government calls the political system a "participatory democracy", with a range of official organisations invited to debate policy, and a system of elected national, regional and local government assemblies. A 2019 constitutional reform divided executive power by reintroducing the role of prime minister, who oversees the daily operation of government; the role of president has become more ceremonial.
Policy issues: The economy has been mainly state-owned since the 1960s, but private activity has grown moderately. The government opposes a transition to a full capitalist economy but is expanding the role of markets. Gradual and partial liberalisation began in 2011, with the introduction of five-year "guidelines" for updating the economy. Non-agricultural private businesses have expanded, and foreign investment is being encouraged. However, progress on liberalisation has been slow so far; as a result, there are still foreign-exchange shortages, weak productivity, and low levels of diversification and economic dynamism.
Taxation: Cuba's tax system is unorthodox. Only earnings from non-state enterprises and joint ventures are subject to income tax. Firms pay social security contributions and profit taxes (30-50%, with exemptions). In 2016 income and social security taxes were extended to state-sector workers; a personal income tax has been in place since 2017 for those working for foreign firms.
Foreign trade: Nickel and services (mainly tourism and medical) dominate exports. Cuba relies on fuel and food imports (which together account for more than half of its total imports), sustaining a wide trade deficit. We estimate that total exports reached US$2.2bn in 2023, and that imports came to US$9.8bn.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability EIU expects political stability risks to remain elevated in 2024-28, reflecting the weak state of Cuba's economy. Deteriorating living standards and public frustrations have increased the frequency of protests and fuelled emigration. The government has responded on the one hand by condemning protesters, and on the other by seeking to placate its critics by modernising the way that Cuba is governed. Decision-making is gradually becoming more decentralised, and the government has allowed private-sector activity to expand. However, public confidence in the government has fallen, particularly among younger Cubans, and is unlikely to improve significantly over the medium term. The president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, is driving this reform process, but he has to contend with institutional inertia, lack of capacity among those who have been given new responsibilities and risk aversion at all levels. Given persistent economic constraints and limited political support, we expect Mr Díaz-Canel to remain a cautious leader during his second and final presidential term (ending in 2028), prioritising stabilisation and policy continuity over bold reform.
Despite heightened tensions arising from weak growth, high inflation and public discontent, we believe that regime change is unlikely in 2024-28, owing to the government's ability to defuse dissent through a combination of its domestic security apparatus and efforts to increase public engagement in decision-making. The authorities are expanding the use of the internet to promote citizen communication with the leadership and with the entities that provide public services, but online platforms have also become potent channels for expressing anti-government sentiment. This has made public demands for accountability and for greater freedom of expression more visible, which has in turn raised pressure on the government. Economic hardships are likely to stoke restiveness throughout the forecast period, particularly among younger Cubans. Against this backdrop, fresh bouts of social unrest could break out, fuelling political instability.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch We expect Cuba's one-party system to remain unchanged in 2024-28. Elections to the National Assembly of People's Power (ANPP, the legislature) are held every five years and are next due in early 2028. Candidates are nominated through municipal councils and by members of official "mass organisations", most of which have links to the ruling Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC), the sole legal party. A single candidate is nominated for each seat, but nominees must be approved by a majority of voters. Dissatisfaction with the political system sometimes manifests itself in a greater incidence of nominees being rejected and a higher abstention rate. Turnout for the March 2023 election to the ANPP fell to 66%, from 80% in 2018, illustrating disengagement in a system that depends on public participation. However, the fact that the majority of the electorate still decided to vote rather than to abstain fits with our view that the political environment will not change significantly in the forecast period.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations We expect US-Cuba tensions to endure and most US sanctions to remain in place throughout the forecast period. The US president, Joe Biden, has timidly rolled back some of the restrictions that were imposed under his predecessor, Donald Trump (2017-21); for instance, he has lifted a cap on remittances and allowed the resumption of charter and commercial flights to airports outside the Cuban capital, Havana. However, the benefits of these moves pale in comparison to the more hostile measures that remain in place, particularly Cuba's inclusion since early 2021 on the US's list of "state sponsors of terrorism". As the November 2024 US presidential election approaches, Mr Biden is unlikely to run the political risk of lifting sanctions more fully. If, as we currently forecast, Mr Biden wins a second term, we think that his Cuba policy will remain focused on aspects of sanctions relief for which political pressure within the US is the strongest; this could involve loosening restrictions on US travel to Cuba, exports and remittances. If, however, Mr Trump were to return to office in 2025, US policy towards Cuba would tighten again, wiping out most of Mr Biden's efforts to restore bilateral ties.
On a regional level, sympathetic presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia will continue to foster political and economic ties with Cuba. Although Cuba's staunch defence of the Venezuelan regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, has put relations with other Latin American presidents under strain, the region's leaders all contributed to the overwhelming approval in November 2023 of a non-binding UN resolution calling for an end to US sanctions on Cuba.
International calls for the US to lift sanctions are unlikely to influence US policy, even though the restrictions have extraterritorial reach, affecting finance, shipping, insurance, trade and investment. US security concerns are more likely to provide the impetus for change. For example, the US is concerned about increasing Russian and Chinese influence in Cuba, especially given reports of positive outcomes from Cuban talks with both countries in recent months. In the case of Russia, a relationship that revolved primarily around Russia providing oil and shipments to Cuba once supplies from Venezuela dried up has now evolved to include more significant political and economic agreements, including debt rescheduling and new investment partnerships. Meanwhile, Cuba has been expanding the scale and scope of its bilateral agreements with China. The two countries have established significant biotechnology collaboration, and recent high-level visits indicate that they are actively exploring co-operation in areas such as renewable energy, telecoms and infrastructure.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends In the short term, policymakers will try to boost domestic agricultural output as a way of reducing the country's reliance on food imports. Its success on this front will be limited, as its production incentives will fail to offset a chronic and severe lack of financing for inputs, infrastructure and spare parts. Increasingly volatile weather conditions amid the ongoing El Niño climate phenomenon also weigh on prospects for the primary sector.
The process of opening the country to the private sector will continue in the medium term, albeit unevenly. The transformation from a centrally planned to a mixed economy will be unhurried, as the government will introduce piecemeal liberalising measures while retaining an interventionist approach. For example, we expect distortionary low prices of basic goods and public utilities to remain in place at least until the second half of our forecast period, when disinflation is likely to set in more firmly. Another constraint on domestic productivity is the government's commitment to full employment, as the rationalisation of public administration will have to wait until the economy has grown enough to provide more employment opportunities beyond the public sector.
Ongoing efforts to encourage the germination of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) will be a major component of the broader modernisation of Cuba's economy. Many MSMEs will struggle to expand in an environment of subdued demand, lack of access to finance and burdensome regulations, but as new and more competitive private enterprises take root, their contribution to national income will increase and pressure on the government for further reforms will grow. We think that this will result in changes to the tax regime and less stringent regulations, which will enable gradual improvements in the business environment.
Private companies have been able to access foreign investment since 2021, but US sanctions will still block most international firms from engaging with Cuba. This will be a significant impediment to progress on meeting targets for the energy transition, industrial development and overall economic growth.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy The budget deficit is has been narrowing since 2020, and we expect this trend to continue in 2024-28, albeit slowly. As budgets for health, education, welfare, and subsidies for food and energy are ring-fenced, the scope for reducing expenditure is limited. Long-delayed essential repairs and maintenance of critical infrastructure, as well as the government's commitment to full employment, will restrict possibilities for cutting the state payroll, posing yet another obstacle to retrenchment. The pace of private-sector expansion will therefore be an important determinant of the government's capacity for fiscal adjustment, as it will affect both the degree to which the public sector can be rationalised and the potential for growth in tax revenue. We estimate that the fiscal deficit narrowed to a still-large 9.5% in 2023 (from 11% in 2022). We expect it to diminish to 6% of GDP by the end of our forecast period, assuming that domestic inflation moderates and that economic growth picks up over the medium term.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy We expect the Cuban authorities to make gradual upward adjustments to fixed prices, which will enable them to increase the use of indirect instruments of monetary policy throughout 2024-28. However, the existence of informal markets with divergent prices and exchange rates will create complications in achieving price stability. In January 2021 the authorities tried to unify the dual-currency system so as to ease some of the distortions in the economy, but this initiative misfired, as it combined with shortages to bring an unprecedented surge in prices. The government's hopes of keeping inflation on a downward trajectory in 2024-28 will rest on its ability to reduce the fiscal deficit and on a greater supply of both domestically produced and imported goods, which in turn will depend on the pace of economic restructuring and an improvement in Cuba's foreign-exchange position.
Although the underdeveloped nature of the financial sector has long dampened the scope and effectiveness of indirect instruments, an improvement is on the cards for 2024-28. The government has shown a commitment to increase the capacity of the banking system, as demonstrated by its recent implementation of new rules that require enterprises to process payments through their accounts, rather than in cash. Over the medium term, we expect the role of the financial sector to increase further, which will reduce informality and will enhance the authorities' capacity for macroeconomic management.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth After a moderate estimated expansion in 2023, real GDP will expand gradually in 2024-28. Steady disinflation will support consumer spending, and liberalising reforms will engender productivity and efficiency gains, spurring growth. Another positive factor is that stronger external demand for Cuban goods and services amid falling global interest rates (particularly in the second half of 2024) will lead to higher export earnings. Nevertheless, fiscal retrenchment, structural inefficiencies, recurrent power outages and US sanctions will preclude stronger economic growth over the medium term.
Cuba's inclusion on the US's list of "state sponsors of terrorism" is having wide-ranging negative economic consequences. Because financial transactions are subject to intense US scrutiny, complications in carrying out cross-border operations have dampened remittances growth and curtailed tourism-related earnings in recent months. Inclusion on the list also makes it more difficult to obtain the imported raw materials and spare parts needed to maintain infrastructure and to sustain industrial and agricultural production, let alone to attract the foreign investment required to modernise these.
Given the dampening effect of US sanctions, we do not expect Cuba's real GDP to return to pre-pandemic levels until after 2025. We forecast average growth of 3.7% per year in 2026-28 as tourism and remittances recover more fully from the pandemic-induced crisis. We do not expect Mr Biden to return entirely to the kind of rapprochement implemented by a former US president, Barack Obama (2009-17), which means that any improvements in Cuba's economic performance will rest on how well the country can cultivate new international trade and financial relations and whether it can stimulate restructuring and innovation in the new private sector and the sclerotic public sector. The current low level of productivity and a highly educated workforce suggest that a surge in growth is theoretically possible, but we think that this will remain a distant prospect given Cuba's limited access to international finance, squeezed fiscal resources, the distortions and lack of integration between sectors arising from monetary dualism, and a legacy of centralised decision-making.
Risks to our GDP growth projections are substantial. The main downside risks are external, as the global economy is vulnerable to shocks that could weaken Cuba's terms of trade, disrupt its relations with important partners (particularly fuel suppliers) or prevent a full recovery of tourism. A sudden lifting of all US sanctions could deliver a strong positive shock, but given the political obstacles to such a policy shift within the US, this is not our central forecast.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation Inflation has begun to moderate following a surge over the past few years as the local currency depreciated sharply and basic goods became scarce. After rising to a whopping 96.8% in 2022, year-end inflation eased to an estimated 27.7% in 2023, and we forecast that it will stay on this downward trajectory over the forecast period, averaging 7.8% per year. We expect that fiscal adjustment, easing commodity prices and a recovery in supplies of basic goods and hard currency (in line with a gradual pick-up in economic growth) will eventually outweigh the fallout from the 2021 currency and price shock, taking inflation to 5% by the end of our forecast period. Nonetheless, there is a risk that fresh shocks will keep inflation elevated for longer. The possibility of a strong El Niño weather phenomenon developing in early 2024 (with effects lasting until mid-year) is the main risk to this scenario, as adverse weather could disrupt supply chains and stoke inflationary pressures.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates Currency adjustment efforts have proven highly disruptive. The January 2021 reform initially unified the dual exchange rate by devaluing the official exchange rate by 96%, to CUP24:US$1 (from CUP1:CUC1:US$1), matching the rate that was previously used for personal transactions. However, following a sharp depreciation of the black-market rate, the authorities introduced a second legal exchange rate for personal transactions in August 2022, at CUP120:US$1, (matching the black-market rate). However, the black-market rate has since depreciated further, to CUP265:US$1 as at end-November. Although the rate of peso weakening has moderated in recent months, mostly because the local currency now appears to be closer to its fair value, a persistent hard-currency shortage will continue to drive some depreciation. On this basis, and assuming that there are no major shocks, we expect the informal exchange rate to weaken only slightly further, averaging CUP270:US$1 in 2024-28.
Risks to our exchange-rate forecast remain very high and relate to any shocks to the economy, international relations or exchange-rate expectations. Although we think that efforts to bring the currency towards more competitive rates will be beneficial in the long term-as they will reduce economic distortions and increase efficiency-the short-term consequences of the undervalued peso, currency duality and exchange-rate volatility will remain hard to manage.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector Currency adjustment and the eventual unification of the dual exchange-rate system should stimulate export growth and import substitution, but the benefits are unlikely to materialise until later in the forecast period. Given that US sanctions will keep trade and investment subdued, Cuba's hard-currency shortage will continue and many debt obligations will go unmet, even though a process of reaching an agreement with some of the country's creditors (including the Paris Club) is under way.
Visitor arrivals have still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels and are unlikely to do so until 2025. The external sector will benefit from health-related exports, aided by Cuba's biotechnology research, which has generated effective covid-19 vaccines and promising treatments for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Sympathetic presidents in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, as well as stronger relations with other partners, including Iran, Russia and China, suggest potential for growth in earnings from exports of goods and services.
Meanwhile, the government will try to keep import spending under control as it seeks to resume debt payments and rebuild international reserves. As a result, the current account will shift from deficit to a slight surplus by the end of our forecast period.

Consumer prices: based on estimated weightings for prices in convertible peso and Cuban peso markets, both formal and informal
Exchange rates: on January 1st 2021 the authorities unified the dual exchange rate. The official exchange rate was devalued by 96%, from CUP1:CUC1:US$1 to CUP24:US$1. The convertible peso (CUC, which was used in hard-currency retail outlets, for imports and by tourists) has been removed from circulation, which left the Cuban peso (CUP, used for salaries and locally produced goods) as the sole local currency. However, as the black-market rate spiralled, the authorities introduced a second exchange rate for personal transactions in August 2022, matching the then black-market rate of CUP120:US$1 and thereby returning to official currency dualism
Money supply growth: official data are given for cash in circulation and regular savings; money supply (M2) is taken to be the sum of these two

Full text: - Bola Tinubu, who took office as president at end-May, quickly embarked on a series of pro-market reforms, including floating of the naira and an end to a costly petrol subsidy. Although welcomed by investors and multilateral creditors, the moves have received a hostile reception from labour unions and the wider public. Mr Tinubu's first term will focus on trying to conserve these policies (with mixed success) rather than broaden the push towards a less statist economic model. Insecurity will be rampant, with the security forces unable to overcome multiple security crises in different parts of the country.
- An implicit petrol subsidy has already returned, but EIU expects deregulation of the market from late 2024, once a new mega-refinery ramps-up production to a scale that will allow elimination of fuel imports. On the exchange rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria has already reverted to keeping tight control over the official market-and is expected to keep doing so-to limit inflation and assist monetary policy.
- Inflation will remain well above the 6-9% target range throughout the 2024-28 forecast period. The central bank's pro-growth slant, combined with inflationary market reforms, will sustain especially forceful price pressures early in this period. However, we expect budget reforms under Mr Tinubu to reduce reliance on central bank finance, lowering what had been rapid growth in the money supply under his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari.
- Fiscal savings due to cuts to the petrol subsidy will be redirected towards higher civil servant salaries (to placate unions) and infrastructure. Mr Tinubu is expected to run an expansionary fiscal policy in order to stimulate growth, resulting in large budget deficits (by Nigerian standards) throughout the forecast period.
- Economic growth will stay well below potential in 2024-28, reaching a peak of 4% in 2025 as a tight monetary policy is unwound. Extreme insecurity, a highly challenging business environment and a giant infrastructure gap will be the main constraints on growth.
- We expect the current-account surplus to widen in 2024-25 as petrol import volumes decline, but to narrow from 2026 as global oil prices continue to slide and the trade balance eventually slips into deficit.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens for the forecast period (2024-28), as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings both fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: Policy is aimed at being pro-business, and some effort is made to move away from protectionism.
2026-28: The non-oil sector is largely shielded from external competition, but the state oil company (NNPC Limited) prepares for partial privatisation (probably through an initial public offering).
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: The Central Bank of Nigeria is expected to attempt exchange-rate unification again in 2025, in order to attract hot money.
2026-28: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, but concerted efforts are made to commercialise the national oil company (which is in joint ventures with multinationals).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: Current-account restrictions are eased and attempts are made to clear a backlog of foreign-exchange orders.
2026-28: Foreign-exchange shortages re-emerge as oil prices slide, heightening the risk of capital controls and other convertibility restrictions, most likely on a de-facto basis as lead times are extended on the official window.
Taxes 2024-25: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, accompanied by tax increases, even though the weak state of the economy, amid hard-biting economic reforms and a high cost of living, will weigh on enforcement.
2026-28: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is raised from 7.5% to 15% to cut the budget deficit and manage debt-service costs.
Financing 2024-25: The government seeks liquidity support from multinationals, but the international capital market remains off limits for the sovereign until 2025. A large budget deficit crowds out private-sector lending.
2026-28: Higher tax revenue limits recourse to fiscal deficit financing via central bank overdrafts.
The labour market 2024-25: Employers face major problems, lay off staff to reduce costs and raise wages to compensate for a sharp rise in the cost of living to retain highly skilled employees.
2026-28: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff and face high costs from retaining skilled workers. Unemployment stays high, and the labour market remains loose.
Infrastructure 2024-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependence on imported petrol.
2026-28: Public investment in infrastructure lags behind budgeted levels and the rate needed to plug the infrastructure gap.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2026-28: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010 his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second and final term in early 2019. In the February 2023 election the presidency was won by Bola Tinubu, who ran on the ruling party ticket.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) was the predominant political force until the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress (APC). With Mr Buhari at the helm, the APC had enough reach to take power in 2015, secure re-election in 2019 and win again in 2023 under Mr Tinubu.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and high unemployment.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes, specifically value-added tax (VAT, 7.5% currently), will be made.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2024-28: Political stability Nigeria's president, Bola Tinubu, is expected to remain in power until at least 2027, when his first term ends, but his time in office will be highly testing. An inescapable problem will be his weak mandate; he won only 36.6% of the popular vote, on a turnout of 27%. Only 8.8m Nigerians voted for him, out of a population estimated at just over 220m. Despite his low popularity, Mr Tinubu has embarked on the biggest economic shake-up of a generation, rapidly rolling out market reforms and dismantling vehicles for patronage and corruption. In theory these reforms hold the key to bringing Nigeria onto a higher growth path, but in EIU's view he moved too hard and too fast.
Mr Tinubu came to power amid high inflation, and moves to deregulate petrol prices and float the currency have aggravated cost-of-living pressures. Given threats of mass industrial action on a scale that has not been seen since 2012, his administration has had to compromise and backtrack. Mr Tinubu will be under continuous pressure from labour unions, the renaissance of which will last, given an outlook of stubbornly high inflation. Mr Tinubu got further than many of his predecessors in pursuing market reforms, but as his political capital has already drained away, and because Nigeria's security situation is so fragile, we expect the agenda to peter out.
Widespread, entrenched poverty and ethno-religious divides are on such a scale that the very future of the current federal structure of Nigeria is at risk. With the security forces overstretched, emergencies will be triaged and resources deployed to whichever is most pressing.
Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province, two Islamist terrorist groups that operate in the north and have a demonstrated ability to carry out terrorist attacks elsewhere in the country, will present an ongoing threat. Violence between farmers and herdsmen in central Nigeria-the agricultural heartland-reflects another deep-seated conflict. The causes, such as high population growth and natural resource depletion, are largely unsolvable. In recent years banditry and kidnapping in the north-east have become a destabilising national crisis. The perpetrators are well funded and have been developing links with terrorist groups and expanding the reach of their operations. In the oil-producing Niger Delta, distrust of the government runs deep and communities feel that they do not get a fair share of Nigeria's oil wealth. Governability in the region will be challenging, and criminal activity linked to militant groups will remain a risk to oil output.
Our baseline assumption is that Nigeria's federal government will assert control over "core" areas such as Abuja, the capital, and other places of political importance, at the expense of "periphery" regions that have long been mired in conflict. This will be enough to keep the seat of power safe, but governance will be minimal across much of the country.
Outlook for 2024-28: Election watch Mr Tinubu won the 2023 presidential election in the first round, and will face the electorate again in 2027. The ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, won a majority in the Senate (the upper house) and the largest number of seats in House of Representatives (the lower house). Nigerian politics is fluid, as party allegiances are often more about political convenience than ideology. Frustration with the two-party system was highlighted by support for Peter Obi, of the fringe Labour Party, in the presidential poll. Backed by unions, he will build the party's profile and become a more formidable force by 2027.
Outlook for 2024-28: International relations Given its size, Nigeria is a major player in Africa, but economic policy has a protectionist skew. Domestic security challenges will reduce Nigeria's ability to contribute troops to regional military forces as it has done in the past, when the country underwrote regional security. The Senate refused Mr Tinubu's proposal to intervene militarily in Niger following a coup in July 2023, and we do not expect the idea of a regional force to gain traction. Nigeria's army is tied up with domestic conflicts, rendering overseas intervention unfeasible. The US has been a major arms supplier to Nigeria and is likely to maintain some security assistance, given the wider regional threats posed by Islamist radical groups.
Outlook for 2024-28: Policy trends Mr Tinubu has rolled out pro-market policies in rapid succession since coming to office, but they have not added up to a coherent plan, compromising his government's ability to make the reforms work. On his first day in office a hugely wasteful petrol subsidy was scrapped. Nigeria will continue importing virtually its entire petrol requirement until the second half of 2024, when a new mega-refinery (the Dangote refinery) materially ramps up output. In the meantime landing costs will fluctuate with the exchange rate, which Mr Tinubu wants to be market-led. Since a "float" of the naira in June the currency has lost 63% of its value against the US dollar. Retail petrol prices have been held fixed despite the higher landing costs for marketers, indicating a return to a covert subsidy to forestall mass industrial action. Politics will generally be consumed by cost-of-living pressures well into 2024, tying Mr Tinubu's hands. The same applies to deregulation of the power sector, another landmark reform. Although investment in the power sector should materialise over the medium to long term, the authorities will baulk at raising tariffs to match costs in the short term.
After brief consolidation in June, a wide (35%) spread between the official and parallel-market exchange rates has re-emerged, reflecting an ongoing reluctance by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to allow free access to hard currency, and resulting illiquidity in the Nigerian Foreign-Exchange Market (NFEM, the official window). Pressing harder on currency reform would therefore mean a hefty devaluation, crushing any pretence of petrol price deregulation (assuming that higher pump prices are a political red line) and stretching a fragile fiscal position.
A decision in October to scrap import controls on 43 imported items-historically a factor behind a lively parallel-market currency trade-is in theory positive for a market-led naira, but will generate added demand in the formal market against limited supply. It demonstrates Mr Tinubu's willingness to take on influential business lobbies that have long benefited from protectionism. However, other factors undermining the naira, such as deeply negative short-term real interest rates, require an orthodox monetary policy that the authorities have not demonstrated enough appetite for. We therefore do not expect a currency float to succeed over 2024-28, although it seems likely that the fuel subsidy will end when the Dangote refinery is able to replace imports, from late 2024 onwards. Market-led pricing will incentivise the facility to sell locally rather than export its output.
Deregulated pricing will also allow NNPC Limited, which initially absorbs subsidy costs, to start operating as a commercial entity, as required by the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), a major piece of oil sector legislation. Combined with more competitive fiscal terms under the PIA, eventual commercialisation of NNPC Limited improves the outlook for investment in hydrocarbons, as multinationals in joint-venture partnerships will be more confident about cash-calls being met. Oil output has been falling over the past decade, but we tentatively project a gradual rise from an estimated 1.24m barrels/day (b/d) in 2022 to 1.41m b/d in 2028. This will not necessarily be linear, however, given numerous operational difficulties, in particular insecurity in the Niger Delta.
Outlook for 2024-28: Fiscal policy Relatively large budget deficits are expected as part of Mr Tinubu's "fiscally active" job-creation and infrastructure agenda. The 2024 budget is in an early draft stage, but already indicates a large increase in non-debt spending. Savings from higher pump prices (even with a covert subsidy) will be recommitted to higher public-sector salaries and cash transfers to poor households. We expect the subsidy reform to have little net effect on the fiscal balance. We forecast a fiscal deficit of 5% in 2024, only marginally down from the estimate for 2023. Deficits are projected to average 4.7% of GDP in 2025-28, although this is still in excess of a legal limit of 3% of GDP and will mark an unusually lax era for fiscal policy in Nigeria. Debt service and high social spending will underpin an elevated expenditure profile, but the petrol subsidy is expected to be stopped in full by 2025 (assuming that the Dangote refinery is at full capacity), easing pressure. We also expect incremental increases in value-added tax (VAT) from 7.5% to 15% by 2027 as efforts are made to widen the tax net (the focus in 2024) to fund high expenditure.
Mr Tinubu is expected to relax existing fiscal responsibility legislation, and as part of the process overhaul annual borrowing limits. This would permit the government to turn to the debt market, rather than rely on the CBN, when revenue underperforms. Costly CBN loans are omitted from official debt reporting and have been a notable part of the debt-servicing burden (and attendant high inflation) in recent years, with interest charged at 3 percentage points above the policy rate. Inclusion of past deficit monetisation in the officially reported debt stock as part of a loan-to-bond swap with the CBN in 2023, and an expected rise in formal borrowing, will cause the public debt/GDP ratio to rise quickly over 2024-28. A statutory 40% ceiling will be breached by end-2025, and public debt will reach 55.1% at end-2028, from less than 20% as recently as end-2022.
Outlook for 2024-28: Monetary policy Mr Tinubu has expressed a desire for interest rates to be lower. Since he took office at end-May there has been one 25-basis-point rise in the policy rate, to 18.75% in July, despite inflation rising by roughly four percentage-points, to 26.7% in September. Two leadership changes at the CBN over the period have interrupted policy coherence, with the September monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting cancelled to allow vetting of the new governor, Yemi Cardoso, and four deputies. Having fallen behind developments, the CBN is expected to tighten more decisively when the MPC next sits (on November 20th-21st at the latest), leading a tightening cycle that began in early 2022 into a more intense phase. We expect the policy rate to be raised by a total of 125 basis points, to a terminal rate of 20%, by early 2024. Real short-term interest rates will stay negative, however, and there is a risk of even greater passivity. The MPC attaches a large weight to economic growth in its decision-making formula, and the CBN's independence is questionable, with political interference likely.
We expect that the first rate cuts will be made in 2025, when disinflation and monetary easing in advanced markets will have set in, and that the policy rate will fall to 12.5% by 2026 and stay there until 2028. Inflation will consistently exceed the 9% target ceiling, and real short-term interest rates will be negative, as we expect the CBN to prioritise stimulus over its price stability mandate.
Outlook for 2024-28: Economic growth We expect real GDP growth to pick up from an estimate of just 2.2% in 2023, but to remain sluggish in 2024, at 2.6%. Performance will be dragged down by high inflation and monetary tightening, causing domestic demand to contract for a third year running in 2024. In a country where the population expands at about 2.5% a year, this marks an unusual stretch of decline. Net exports will be the sole growth driver early in the forecast period. We expect oil export volumes to increase as security in the Niger Delta allows higher oil output; the balance will be complemented by the displacement of fuel and chemical imports in 2024 as the Dangote refinery ramps up production. As inflation falls and monetary policy becomes expansionary from 2025, domestic demand will return to (low) growth. Consequently, real GDP growth will rise to 4% in 2025-the highest rate since 2014, owing partly to rebound effects-and average 3.2% in 2026-28, with the PIA and recent deregulation of the power sector expected to support investment over the medium to long term.
Outlook for 2024-28: Inflation Inflation has continued to rise throughout 2023, and the pace has quickened since June owing to market reforms, which are likely to have powerful second-round pass-through effects. Currency losses on the parallel market, where a sizable share of foreign exchange is transacted, will be a major driver of imported inflation into 2024. From an estimated rate of 30.5% at end-2023, inflation will stay high in 2024, at 23.6% on average for the year, owing to a delayed and insufficient monetary response coupled with fiscal expansionism. The decline assumes that petrol prices will be held steady over much of the year. In latter years an undercurrent of softer global commodity prices should foster a continued disinflationary trend until 2028, although in no year will inflation fall within the 7-9% target range. Factors behind this include insecurity, a large devaluation in 2025, the need to deliver cost-reflective electricity tariffs and the CBN's dovishness. We expect inflation to average 13.2% in 2025-28.
Outlook for 2024-28: Exchange rates The naira's "float" in June was followed by heavy losses on the parallel market (of 45% against the US dollar since June), in part driven by low liquidity in the NFEM and speculation. The CBN has since reverted to guiding the exchange rate by limiting access to foreign-exchange sales for banks and other dealers that quote hard currency outside a preferred rate. An unsupportive monetary policy implies that the naira will remain under pressure, and the CBN lacks the firepower to adequately supply the market or clear a backlog of foreign exchange orders, valued at over US$6bn, which will keep foreign investors unnerved. Official foreign reserves are reported at US$33bn, but up to one-third of the assets are encumbered, tied up in derivative contracts or loans. In the short to medium term the official exchange rate will continue to be propped up by access restrictions, implying long lead times at the NFEM.
The CBN is expected to resist another attempt at convergence until petrol imports are eliminated in late 2024, with the naira ending that year at N822.9:US$1, down from an estimated N810:US$1 at end-2023 (accounting for some likely near-term weakening). Sizable devaluations are expected in 2025-or possibly sooner-causing a 38.5% loss against the US dollar over the year, to N1,142.5:US$1 at end-December. However, we do not expect lasting commitment to a market-led naira, as the CBN lacks experience of conducting monetary policy under a float. High inflation and a continued spread with the parallel market will leave the exchange-rate regime unstable and result in periodic devaluations. We project a rate of N1,262.1:US$1 at end-2028, with a continuous spread with the parallel market expected.
Outlook for 2024-28: External sector Strong oil prices, rising crude output and a ramp-up of the Dangote refinery, which should eventually eliminate all imports of petrol (15% of total imports) and export fuels regionally, will deliver a comfortable current-account surplus as a share of GDP, of 2.9% in 2024 and 3% in 2025, up from an estimated surplus of 2.1% in 2023. In later years sliding world oil prices will be a dominant trend, outweighing further incremental increases in crude production. Owing to this and growing domestic demand, which will suck in imports, the surplus will narrow throughout 2026-28, to 0.1% of GDP at end-2028. The narrower trade surplus in these years will sit beside large structural services and income deficits, mainly related to the hydrocarbons sector. This will leave the surplus heavily dependent on remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora. As economic growth strengthens in advanced economies these inflows should also rise, although the ease of operating through unofficial channels or through cryptocurrency will limit inflows formally recorded in the current account.

Full text: - Egypt's political sphere will remain tightly controlled, reflecting the regime's latent vulnerabilities. The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is expected to win a third term in a December 2023 presidential election, against a muzzled opposition, and govern until 2029. The afterglow of his first years in power, during which his government took credit for restoring political stability after years of turmoil following the 2011 Arab Spring, has faded. Egypt's high public debt load precludes expansionary fiscal policy over his third term and the country is in the grip of the worst cost-of-living crisis in modern history. Having been in power too long to escape blame for Egypt's economic problems, the government is expected to fall back on repression to keep dissent at bay, particularly as unpopular economic reform is unavoidable. A prominent risk is the military intervening (as they did in 2013 to remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power) if mass protests were to break out. However, there is little formal opposition, and generally little appetite for Egypt to return to a state of upheaval, working in the regime's favour.

- Egypt's business environment score improves for the forecast period, and its global and regional rankings rise by four places and one place respectively. As Egypt faces the real prospect of sovereign default, market-led reforms will be front and centre of the policy agenda in the short to medium term to reassure foreign investors and the IMF. Investment and licensing reforms are helping to reduce high levels of red tape and to boost incentives for private enterprise.

- The economic outlook is considerably more muted in the short term than in the medium to long term. High inflation, rising interest rates, currency devaluation, import controls and fiscal tightening will cause economic growth to slow sharply in 2024. Tighter credit conditions and fiscal policy will depress domestic demand, leaving real GDP growth dependent on the performance of the export sector, which is being supported by high prices for gas and a more competitive currency. The Central Bank of Egypt is expected to switch to a more market-led foreign-exchange regime in 2024, once the presidential election passes and the political will to back unpopular reforms becomes greater.

- Egypt remains the most populous state in the Middle East, and its working-age population is set to grow fast. This will present both a demographic opportunity, owing to the presence of a sizeable, youthful workforce, and a demographic challenge if new job opportunities are unable to keep up. The historical role of the Gulf in absorbing surplus Egyptian labour is likely to diminish, given indigenisation efforts in that region. Egypt is highly urbanised, with nearly one-tenth of the population living in Cairo.

- In population terms, Egypt boasts the largest consumer market in the Middle East and North Africa. However, the potential of this market will be constrained in the short to medium term by weak purchasing power per head in US-dollar terms, given high inflation, devaluations of the Egyptian pound and a downturn in the economy. Poorer consumers will remain wary of spending owing to subsidy reform and recent economic instability. GDP per head figures mask deep income disparities between the rich and the poor, with most of the population in the latter category.

- Egypt has started to address long-standing market distortions as a result of balance-of-payment pressures, but tends to revert to a politically convenient status quo whenever economic pressures dissipate. The gross national savings rate is chronically low, leaving total factor productivity gains as the driver for sustained economic growth. The autocratic nature of the political environment, cronyism, a large bureaucracy and an incoherent legal code all weigh on the long-term outlook. EIU expects average annual real GDP growth of 3.3% in 2031-50 and 3.6% over the 2024-50 horizon.

Background: In 1952 an army coup brought an end to the monarchy in Egypt. Gamal Abdel Nasser, a former military officer, took power two years later and remained president from 1954 until 1970, introducing nationalist policies. Under his successor, Anwar Sadat (1970-81), Egypt's political stance shifted towards the West and its economic policies became more liberal. Mr Sadat's signing in 1979 of a peace treaty with Israel eventually led to his assassination and the appointment of his deputy, Hosni Mubarak, as president in 1981. However, Mr Mubarak grew increasingly unpopular, and a popular uprising, backed by the military, forced his resignation in early 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood, which had been banned since 1954, won the parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012; however, in the wake of mass protests, it was ousted by the military in July 2013. The former army chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president in a landslide victory in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018. The next presidential election will be held in December 2023.
Political structure: Egypt's semi-presidential system is based on the 2014 constitution, which granted parliament wider powers, including the right to withdraw confidence from the president. However, the current parliament-which was elected in late 2015-lacks an effective opposition bloc. In April 2019 the constitution was amended to extend the presidential term and strengthen the powers of the office, including over parliament, the judiciary and the military.
Policy issues: Weak institutional capacity and opposition from vested interests often block economic reform. Nonetheless, the Sisi regime is keen to enhance the business environment and consolidate the public finances through fiscal reform, under a new IMF agreement designed to restore market confidence and meet external payment needs.
Taxation: The top tax rate on firms and individuals was cut in mid-2015, from 25% to 22.5% on incomes of E£200,000 (US$22,523 at the pre-2016 flotation official rate) or above. A capital gains tax (set at 10%) was introduced in January 2022 but has since been reduced to 5% for some share transactions, but only temporarily. Value-added tax (VAT) of 13% was introduced in August 2016 and raised to 14% in fiscal year 2017/18.
Foreign trade: Egypt has a large structural trade deficit. Despite declining hydrocarbons output, oil and gas remain the country's leading export earners. Suez Canal transit fees provide about US$7bn a year in foreign-currency inflows, and the current account fluctuates, normally registering a modest deficit.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Present government: The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, won a second four-year term in March 2018, and has confirmed his candidacy in the upcoming presidential election, in December 2023. He will stand against minimal opposition after the main contender, Ahmed Tantawi, an outspoken critic of Mr Sisi and an independent member of parliament (MP), decided not to run. Dozens of Mr Tantawi's supporters, relatives and affiliates have been arrested. The electoral process is coercive and EIU judges the result to be a fait accompli victory for the incumbent. Turnout will be a more interesting gauge of the regime's popularity, and will probably be low. Parliament is dominated by rubber-stamp parties and does not represent a meaningful check and balance on executive authority.
The technocratic government is subservient to the president Domestic policy will remain largely focused on economic and social reform. Among the most important ministers are the finance minister, the foreign minister and the planning and economic development minister. The cabinet is largely technocratic, which reflects a constitutional bar on MPs serving in the executive. Many ministers are highly educated, but the cap on public-sector salaries has made it harder to recruit ministers who have had success in the private sector. The president has taken steps to boost the representation of Copts and women in the cabinet, which now has eight female ministers following a reshuffle in August 2022.
The armed forces and their various affiliates have assumed an increasingly important role in the economy, and particularly in infrastructure projects, during Mr Sisi's rule. This trend is likely to be gradually reversed in the coming years, as the government will come under pressure from the IMF and prospective foreign investors to address the issue of the crowding-out of the private sector by military and other state-sector enterprises. However, while Mr Sisi remains in power the army will continue to be conferred enormous political influence in exchange for supporting the regime.
Parliamentary forces: The complex make-up of parliament changed during the 2020 elections, with Mostaqbal Watan, a new party formed by pro-Sisi activists, having secured large majorities in both the House of Representatives (the lower house) and the restored Senate (the upper house). However, parliament remains in effect a rubber-stamp body loyal to the president. The previous, unicameral parliament was dominated by a Sisi-loyalist bloc, including figures with close ties to the security services and businesspeople, but this was made up mainly of independents, and no party held a majority. The first election for the Senate (which was abolished in 2013 but restored in 2019) took place in August 2020; the next is due in 2025. The ostensible reason for the Senate's revival was to provide an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny. However, given that 100 of its 300 members are appointed by the president and that candidate lists for the elections for both houses were closely scrutinised, it has also enabled Mr Sisi to tighten his control over the legislature. The turnout in the lower house election in 2020 was below 30%, indicating growing public disengagement with a political process that is so tightly controlled by the president and his backers.
Political outlook: Political stability We expect the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to remain in power throughout 2024-28, assuming that he stands for a third term in the presidential election, which has been brought forward from February 2024 to mid-December. Mr Sisi will face little to no genuine competition in the poll. The main risk to stability will be in the form of a popular uprising; with this in mind, Mr Sisi's next term will be his most challenging yet. Egypt is in the grip of the greatest cost-of-living crisis in its modern history, and inflation is under all scenarios expected to stay high over the medium term. The social contract on which the regime's legitimacy rests in part involves a strong economy, coupled with poise on the world stage and maintenance of internal security. The regime is increasingly unable to deliver on the first two; Egypt is heavily dependent on financial aid from the Gulf, and economic reforms on the horizon (in particular subsidy cuts and currency devaluation) will compound the financial strain on households.
As its case to the Egyptian people becomes less convincing, we expect the regime to turn to stricter authoritarianism. There is little appetite for Egypt to return to the instability that followed the 2011 uprising, and the regime can tap into such fears to gather some popular support against dissenters. Destabilising levels of unrest are not our core scenario, but the risk cannot be ruled out; declining living standards and reforms aimed at reducing the military's (large) presence in the economy carry serious risks to overall stability. If a popular movement against the regime was to break out, the military would have an opening for an opportunistic power grab to protect its business interests. As the catalyst could be any number of minor incidents, repression is expected to be intense in the medium term, when economic pressures will be most acute. Erraticism in the form of regular military, and possibly cabinet, reshuffles and changes to the business environment is likely. High turnover at the top of the army indicates that tensions with the executive are already present.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Egypt's bureaucracy is the largest in the North Africa region-and among the most bloated globally-with nearly 6m workers employed by the central government (this excludes about 3m additional workers who are employed by the state on temporary contracts and a military of about 1.5m.) Overstaffing often means inefficiency, placing a heavy burden on the public finances and leaving fewer funds for improving public services and upgrading systems. The populist bent of parliament sometimes holds back domestic reform and, despite public debt pressures and a large budget deficit, the government has continued to fund large increases in compensation for public-sector workers.
Corruption remains entrenched despite government commitments Mr Sisi has professed his determination to make the government more efficient and to crack down on corruption. Despite an anti-corruption drive by the government, the practice remains deeply entrenched, if often subtle. The agency tasked with combating corruption, the Administrative Control Authority, is closely tied to the presidency and is restricted to the civilian bureaucracy. This renders institutional provisions for scrutinising the expanding role of the military establishment and the intelligence services in the economy insufficient.
The prerogatives of the military were strengthened in a set of constitutional amendments that were approved in April 2019. These amendments also reinforced the presidency's control over the judiciary (and over military appointments). A tightening of restrictions on public expression has also hit civil society organisations, which are heavily constrained. The increasing centralisation of power within the presidential office and among senior military and intelligence figures might yield some improvements in the efficiency of government operations, but at the expense of accountability and at the risk of fostering corruption within these privileged echelons of the state.
Government operations are being transferred to the new capital Another important development during the forecast period will be the transfer of government operations from Cairo to the new administrative capital, to the east. Ministries have already been migrating over to the city. The project is being led by a joint venture between the Ministry of Defence and an arm of the Ministry of Housing. Khaled Abbas, a deputy housing minister with no military background, has headed the board since late 2022, after replacing a military general. This could be part of a government effort to lower the profile of the military, the influence of which in the economy will be rolled back or at least made less conspicuous. The move to the new capital provides an opportunity to streamline government operations by having a dedicated zone for them, with modern infrastructure and information technology services. However, there will inevitably be some disruption during the transfer, and the location of the new city (in largely disused land) does not aid the development of other, established cities.
Political outlook: Election watch The next presidential election will now be held in December 2023, brought forward from February 2024. Candidacies for presidential poll open in October. Elections are less a democratic exercise than a means for Mr Sisi to consolidate power. Associates of opposition figures have been arrested, and the electoral process is not expected to be free or fair. Turnout will be a more useful gauge of the regime's underlying popularity than the result. Turnout was just over 40% for the 2018 presidential election (in which Mr Sisi won 97% of the vote) and even lower for the 2020 legislative election, when rubber-stamp parties won a majority. Assuming that Mr Sisi wins comfortably, he will govern without serious political opposition until the next election, which is due at end-2029.
Political outlook: International relations Medium-term balance-of-payments pressures will leave Egypt dependent on financial support from the Gulf states early in the forecast period, when other liquidity channels will be restricted or inadequate against financing needs. Gulf states view Mr Sisi as a natural ally, recognising Egypt's large market and geopolitical importance, which in essence make the country "too big to fail". However, there are signs of impatience among Gulf partners about endless support for Egypt, making this financial reliance unsustainable and catalysing market reform, which is expected from 2024.
Relations with Ethiopia will be highly tense over the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which threatens the volume of water flow from the Blue Nile to Egypt. Ethiopia recently completed the filling of the reservoir behind the dam, years ahead of schedule. Egypt has threatened military strikes against the GERD, and diplomacy appears close to exhaustion without a concession from Ethiopia. We view Egypt's military deterrent as credible; Mr Sisi's worsening domestic situation makes an overseas adventure against the GERD-which is widely seen in Egypt as an existential threat-a useful distraction from domestic economic pressures ahead of the election. The regime's autocratic nature also means that a decision to attack the dam could be made quickly, without broad consultation.
As Ethiopia's government has scored a major political win by filling the reservoir, we believe that it will be more willing to make concessions from a position of strength, especially as the threat of war from the Egyptian side is likely to get louder. Our baseline view is that a water-sharing agreement will be made, reinforced by pressure from Ethiopia's international partners and donors, who will be concerned by the prospect of a new conflict in an already fragile region. However, the risk of conflict is high.
Crisis in Sudan and Egyptian foreign policy In April conflict broke out between the Sudanese army, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti). Militarily, both sides are evenly matched, and a drawn-out and brutal war appears more probable than any other scenario.
Egypt wants a quick resolution to the conflict, both to prevent a massive refugee crisis on its southern border and so that Sudan can continue to participate in tripartite negotiations over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Diplomacy on ending the Sudan conflict will be led by Gulf and Western powers, as Egypt is not formally part of the UN-backed peace process for Sudan. Egypt is therefore likely to have an undersized role in ending a conflict that could easily spill over and create a direct threat to its own national security, despite having recently hosted talks between the two warring sides in Sudan. Egypt's calls for peace on the international stage will carefully chime with those of Gulf powers, which will have a more weighty part to play.
However, layered underneath, Egypt will have a private interest in General Burhan emerging victorious over Hemedti. Egypt and General Burhan share a mutual suspicion of Ethiopia and both have not shied away from aggressive posturing, unlike Hemedti, who has indicated a greater willingness to compromise. For Egypt, the GERD question is of utmost importance, but unilateral intervention to tip the balance of power in the Sudan conflict is unlikely. Gulf powers have long-standing ties with Hemedti, will be eager for the conflict to be contained and have considerable leverage over Egypt as co-financiers for its IMF programme. We expect Egypt to tread a careful path.

Overview: Egypt's overall score improves for the forecast period (2024-28), and its regional and global rankings rise by one and four places respectively. However, the rise in the rankings is largely attributable to the sharp deterioration in the outlook for countries that Egypt has overtaken, including Russia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. The enhanced scores for Egypt in the forecast period come in categories that will be affected by structural reforms designed to improve the performance of the economy and to upgrade the operating environment for the private sector.
Strengths: Market opportunities will continue to be the most positive element in Egypt's business outlook. The government has set a target of doubling the private sector's share in total investment to 65% by 2025. This will entail the potential sale of billions of US dollars in state assets, and greenfield investment will be encouraged by streamlining of regulations. Much of the new investment will come from foreign companies, and the privatisation process will boost the capital market, as reflected in the improvement in the financing category of Egypt's rankings.
Weaknesses: Deep-seated weaknesses in Egypt's macroeconomic position will dampen investor sentiment early in the forecast period. External debt servicing will be a major pressure point on the balance of payments, with about US$18bn in payments due to the IMF alone by 2028. High inflation in 2024 and frustration with the authoritarian rule of the president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, will aggravate social tensions, reflected in the fall in the political stability ranking.
What to watch
- A critical test of the government's commitment to structural reform will be whether the role of the military establishment in the economy is reduced. Thus far the military has resisted pressures to sell assets and to refrain from using its competitive advantage to dominate important sectors of the economy.
- Repayments due to the IMF will peak in 2024-25, when US$11.8bn of the total US$18bn outstanding is scheduled to be repaid. Egypt will find it hard to meet these payments on time without sufficient finance from fresh borrowing, aid from Gulf Arab states and direct and indirect foreign investment inflows.

Business environment outlook: Egypt's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2024-25: The government sells stakes in about 30 companies, mainly to Gulf Arab investors. However, the military retains control of most of its core assets, presenting a barrier to the growth of private-sector investment.
2026-28: Business interests elected in the new parliament try to build pressure for the enactment of new legislation to ensure free and fair competition.
Policy towards foreign investment 2024-25: The government enhances incentives for foreign investors, through new tax breaks, wider access to fast-track "golden licences" and discounted land prices.
2026-28: Foreign investors operating in newly established special economic zones will receive additional incentives.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2024-25: The import backlog stemming from restrictions imposed during 2022 is gradually cleared, but access to import finance remains difficult as the Central Bank of Egypt continues to try to manage the exchange-rate system.
2026-28: Under close scrutiny from the IMF, the government and the central bank maintain a relatively liberal foreign trade and exchange-rate regime.
Taxes 2024-25: The government starts to apply new taxation rules for the public sector and the military, according to a law passed in mid-2023 to withdraw tax breaks for state enterprises. Military companies exploit loopholes in the law, however.
2026-28: Discounts on capital gains tax are phased out. The government considers cutting the corporation tax rate, from 22.5%. The value-added tax (VAT) rate is raised from 14% to 15%. New fees are introduced to boost indirect tax revenue.
Financing 2024-25: Lending to the private sector is subdued, owing to rising interest rates.
2026-28: Domestic credit conditions improve as interest rates ease. Subsidies on lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and other designated groups are phased out.
The labour market 2024-25: Labour unrest grows as workers demand higher wages to compensate for rising inflation. Unemployment remains low, but this partly reflects the low participation rate, particularly among women. A new labour law comes into force.
2026-28: Labour participation gradually increases. Trade unions resist pension reforms that raise the retirement age to 65.
Infrastructure 2024-25: Major new rail projects, including a monorail serving the new administrative capital, progress. A second container terminal is built at East Port Said. Suez Canal development, new cities, slum clearance and Sinai infrastructure are prioritised.
2026-28: Road and rail connections to 14 new satellite cities are completed. Investment in seawater desalination increases.
Technological readiness 2024-25: Tax payments are digitised, and e-government is expanded.
2026-28: E-government portals are put into general use to automate processes of business-licensing applications.

Overview: Egypt's macroeconomic environment will be challenging early in the forecast period, but is expected to improve overall in the longer term. A core assumption is that Egypt will reconnect with a stalled US$3bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF by devaluing the Egyptian pound in early 2024 and accelerating the privatisation agenda. Such reforms are expected to unlock higher private-led investment later in the forecast period, and reassure markets about the public finances in order to regain access to external finance. The near-term outlook is held down by the adjustment phase, which will involve exchange-rate volatility, high inflation, tight credit conditions and austerity.
Strengths: A few sectors of the economy have the potential to grow rapidly, creating jobs and boosting foreign-exchange earnings. The recovery of tourism following the coronavirus pandemic gained momentum in 2023, which is likely to be a record year for both visitor numbers and revenue. By 2028 tourism is expected to bring in about US$15bn per year. Devaluation of the Egyptian pound will bring down asset prices to a more attractive level for foreign investors, while conferring a strong competitive advantage on Egyptian exporters. Egypt's natural gas production has fallen, but major international companies are investing heavily in offshore exploration. If these efforts yield significant new discoveries, Egypt will be in a position to benefit from rising liquefied natural gas revenue in the second half of the forecast period.
Weaknesses: Egypt depends on external borrowing and foreign investment inflows to cover its large structural current-account deficit. As Egypt's credit rating has deteriorated, these props will no longer be so easily available. Egypt has already used up its IMF quota, and a US$3bn loan that was approved at end-2022 was based on exceptional access. The government has US$11.8bn of repayments due to the IMF in 2024-25, with a further US$4.6bn due to be repaid in 2026-27. Interest payments on the US$30bn stock of sovereign bonds will average US$1.6bn a year during 2024-28, with $6.5bn due in bond redemptions. Portfolio investors were previously attracted by high real interest rates, but this is no longer the case. Egypt will rely heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) and continued financial support from its Gulf Arab allies. If these inflows fall short, the government will struggle to meet its debt-service obligations.
What to watch
- Relations with the IMF will have a major bearing on macroeconomic policy and performance. The EFF that was signed in December 2022 is meant to last until October 2026, but the agreement was suspended after just three months as the government reverted to a fixed exchange-rate system. Both sides will try to ensure that the deal is revived. Egypt will reiterate its commitment, in principle, to a flexible exchange-rate regime, and press ahead with structural reforms to limit the role of the state sector. It is also likely to push for an increase in the loan and an extension to repayment deadlines for previous loans. Negotiations will be tough; further suspensions of the loan agreement are likely.
- Beyond headline GDP growth figures, the performance of the domestic savings component of GDP will provide a clearer indication of the economy's underlying health. Domestic savings-comprising private consumption, government consumption, investment and stocks-contracted in the first half of fiscal year 2022/23 (July-June). Overall growth has been sustained mainly by the sharp fall in the domestic resource gap, reflecting the level of trade in goods and services. EIU expects this pattern to continue until inflation and interest rates start to come down, from late 2024.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
Overview: Egypt's policy towards private enterprise and competition will improve over 2024-28 as the government seeks to streamline the regulatory system and promote private investment. The global and regional rankings both rise as a result. In May 2023 the government announced a strategy aimed at increasing the private-sector share in total investment from 30% to 65% within three years. Targets included raising US$40bn over four years through the sale of state holdings in companies and infrastructure. In a bid to streamline investment, the terms for businesses to secure land for projects on a usufruct basis will be enhanced, so that they will only be charged for infrastructure services. The government has also passed a law designed to create a level playing field for the private sector by abolishing tax exemption for state companies, including those controlled by the military, and defining sectors from which state investment is excluded. However, the law has loopholes that will make it hard to enforce against determined and entrenched state interests.
Strengths: Egypt has an established judicial framework for commercial competition, and this has recently been strengthened with the approval of amendments to the 2005 competition law. The main change is the requirement for companies planning mergers to secure clearance from the Egyptian Competition Authority before the transaction is concluded. The original law only obliged the transaction party to notify the regulatory authority within one month after closure. Fines for non-compliance have also been stiffened, to 10% of turnover, from 1%. More broadly, Egypt has a large and diversified private sector, buttressed by a well-developed commercial and investment banking system and by a vigorous capital market.
Weaknesses: Private businesses operate at a disadvantage in many sectors, given the presence of state entities, including those controlled by the military establishment, that benefit from a wide range of exemptions from fees and taxes, and which have privileged access to critical resources such as land, finance, utilities and labour. The government regularly professes commitment to increased private-sector investment in an environment of free and fair competition. However, state interests are strongly represented at all levels in the political and administrative system, and the judiciary is heavily politicised. The grip of the military and state intelligence services over the business sector has strengthened in the decade since Mr Sisi seized power.
What to watch
- The government has instructed state-owned enterprises, including military firms, to provide regular quarterly financial statements. However, the schedule for this remains vague, and there is as yet no clear enforcement mechanism.
- In mid-2022 the government issued a strategy document outlining detailed targets for the restructuring of the state sector. There were three categories: sectors from which the state should divest within three years; sectors in which the state would remain, while sustaining or reducing investment; and sectors in which the state would remain, while sustaining or increasing investment. These targets establish criteria for assessing progress on structural reforms, and will form part of the IMF's monitoring of this aspect of the economic policy.

Overview: Egypt's score for policy towards foreign investment improves markedly for the forecast period, and its global and regional rankings rise by seven and four places respectively, to 58th and seventh. This reflects government plans to sell stakes that it holds in up to 50 assets by 2025. In 2022 sales of shares held by state entities in five listed companies raised more than US$3bn, helping to boost FDI to US$11.4bn, the highest level in 15 years. ADQ, an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund have been the leading institutional investors. The government is also seeking to attract more greenfield investment by broadening the criteria for fast-track "golden licences" (which were originally restricted to strategic projects), enhancing terms for operating in special economic zones and offering preferential credit terms to finance land acquisitions.
Strengths: Egypt offers foreign investors a wide range of opportunities and attractions. These include: a domestic market of over 100m people; a large, predominantly young, labour force, including skilled technicians and professionals, many of whom have had experience of working in the Gulf, Europe or North America. Egypt has considerable untapped natural resources, notably minerals, a sector that is starting to attract more interest following amendments to the mining code. Egypt's geographic location is an added advantage; the Suez Canal offers opportunities for logistical and industrial development targeted at export markets in Europe, Africa and Asia. Abundant sunshine, plentiful open land, and established wind corridors make Egypt a good location for solar and wind power, potentially linked to green hydrogen.
Weaknesses: Despite repeated government assurances of speedy approvals and timely processing of tax affairs, investors face bureaucratic obstacles, alongside delays in clearing materials and equipment through customs, and in securing foreign exchange to finance imports and to repatriate dividends. The abolition of the Ministry of Investment in 2019 means that investors seeking to raise issues with the executive branch of government have to gain access to the office of the prime minister, or even the president.
What to watch
- The next wave of privatisation will include the 580-MW Gabal Zeit wind farm and the 4.8-GW Beni Suef combined-cycle power station. Valuation issues will be a factor in efforts to sell two banks-Banque du Caire and United Bank of Egypt-and Misr Insurance Company. The batch of sales currently under negotiation includes two military companies, Wataniya (service stations) and Safi (bottled water). An important issue with these sales will be how much of the proceeds return to the military.
- The government has announced a series of framework agreements for new investment zones. They include an industrial development zone linked to the East Port Said container transshipment terminal, a Chinese industrial development zone by the Suez Canal, and the Golden Triangle zone, which is dedicated to phosphate processing and linked to Safaga, a Red Sea port.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
Overview: Egypt's score in this category improves-although its rankings are unchanged-owing to the recent lifting of import restrictions, and in the light of our forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink as a percentage of GDP. Egypt will continue to face elevated currency risk, owing to a rapid increase in external borrowing, an escalation of commodity import costs, a thinning foreign-reserve buffer and lengthened lead times on foreign-exchange transactions. Importers and investors looking to repatriate dividends will continue to face the periodic prospect of difficulty in securing foreign exchange in the short to medium term.
Strengths: Egypt has a relatively open trading system, and scores in the middle range for capital-account liberalisation, similar to Tunisia, and just below Morocco. Customs clearance remains sluggish, but systems have improved with digitisation and with rollout of the advanced cargo information system for both maritime ports and airports. The current account will benefit from strong growth in tourism and from the increase in income from the Suez Canal following the expansion of the waterway, which has enabled swifter transit.
Weaknesses: Exchange-rate policy is in a state of flux. As part of an agreement that was signed with the IMF at end-2022, the government committed to establishing a durably flexible exchange-rate regime. A new governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Hassan Abdalla, allowed the currency to depreciate, until, under political pressure, the CBE reverted to a fixed rate regime in March 2023. The parallel foreign-exchange market has meanwhile been revived, and a devaluation is an essential condition for restarting an IMF programme that Egypt needs to address a balance-of-payments crisis.
What to watch
- The CBE will eventually return to a flexible regime, but may intervene once more if the currency depreciates too far and too fast. We expect a devaluation of about 15% after the presidential election in December.
- Mr Abdalla, an experienced banker with a low profile, was appointed governor temporarily. His mandate has been extended until August 2024. A new governor is likely to be appointed for a full five-year term, with an opportunity to chart a new medium-term strategy for Egypt's monetary policy.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
Overview: Egypt's global ranking falls by three places owing to excessive fiscal deficits and the risk of tax rises, but its regional ranking is unchanged. According to a five-year tax strategy published in 2023, the 22.5% rate will stay in place. Corporate tax collection will improve following the digitalisation of the system. The government is seeking to boost tax revenue through newly introduced charges of 5-20% on entertainment and a 10% fee on luxuries. A new top rate of personal income tax has been set at 27.5% for annual incomes of more than E£1.2m (US$38,804). The previous top rate was 25%. At the bottom of the scale, the tax threshold was raised in the 2023/24 budget, to E£36,000 (US$1,164) per year, from E£24,000. The government has since increased it further, to E£45,000.
Strengths: Value-added tax (VAT) was introduced in 2016 after lengthy deliberations going back to the mid-2000s. It has become the bedrock of government tax revenue, accounting for about half of total tax receipts and almost one-third of total fiscal revenue. VAT is currently charged at a standard rate of 14%. The government may eventually increase the rate, but this is unlikely to happen before the inflation rate comes down substantially. The assurance from the Ministry of Finance that no change is envisaged for the 22.5% rate of corporation tax for five years confers the benefit of predictability, although many in the business community would like to see the rate lowered.
Weaknesses: The approach to capital gains tax (CGT) has been inconsistent. The implementation of the 2015 CGT law had been deferred repeatedly, given concerns about its impact on stockmarket investment. The tax was finally applied in January 2022. Residents are liable to 10% CGT on net portfolio earnings at the end of the tax year. Non-residents are exempt. In March, as part of a package of stimulus measures, the government lowered the CGT rate for investments in initial public offerings to 5% for two years, after which the rate will rise to 7.5%. Resident and non-resident investors in non-listed companies are charged withholding (or dividend) tax at a rate of 10%. The withholding tax rate for foreign investment in loans and other forms of debt securities is 20%.
What to watch
- The government has declared its intention to abolish the extensive tax privileges enjoyed by state-owned companies, including military firms. Parliament passed a law setting out these principles in July 2023, but provided for exemptions to continue for activities related to national security, defence, basic infrastructure and projects covered by international agreements. The finance ministry has indicated that it expects this law to provide a major rise in tax revenue. However, much will depend on the details of its implementation, which should be spelled out in executive regulations during 2024.
- The government may reconsider the complex set of tax incentives that are part of the investment legislation. During the 2000s the government judged that tax exemptions were not effective in attractive long-term investment, and the law was changed to subject investors to the standard rate of corporation tax. The new system under Law 72 of 2017 is a hybrid, with exemptions replaced by different scales of discounts based on a wide range of criteria.

Overview: Egypt's score improves sharply, pushing the country's ranking from 69th globally to 48th. This is based on an expectation of privatisation. Sovereign wealth funds from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar will continue to pump capital into Egypt via acquisitions of both listed and unlisted assets. Bank lending to the private sector will remain subdued, because of the government's chronic requirement for deficit financing and because of the deterrent effect of high interest rates on corporate borrowers. About two-thirds of domestic credit is made up of lending to the government, mainly in the form of Treasury bills and bonds, with the private business sector accounting for only about 21%. These ratios are unlikely to change substantially during the forecast period.
Strengths: Egypt has access to finance from a wide range of international and regional institutions. The World Bank remains heavily engaged in Egypt, with a US$7bn pipeline of development loans, including major projects supporting the health and education sectors and social safety-net programmes. The European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan, Germany, France and South Korea will continue to provide credit for infrastructure projects. Egypt will also make extensive use of credit lines from the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and Arab development agencies. It is a member of the National Development Bank, an institution established by the BRICS group, a bloc created by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which Egypt has recently been invited to join.
Weaknesses: Egypt has rapidly accumulated external debt, which increased fourfold over a decade, reaching US$165bn in mid-2023. A large portion of this debt must be repaid or refinanced over the next five years. This includes about US$18bn to the IMF, with a bunching of US$11.8bn in interest and principal payments due in 2024-25. Egypt also needs to pay about US$1.6bn per year in interest on its stock of US$30bn in sovereign Eurobonds, with a further US$6.5bn in principal payments during 2024-28. Balance-of-payment pressures have been reflected in a switch in the net foreign asset position of the commercial banking system, from a comfortable surplus to a deficit of about US$15bn as at mid-2023.
What to watch
- The government will seek to diversify sources of external finance. This will include more borrowing from China, which currently accounts for only about US$8bn of Egypt's total external debt, according to the CBE. The debt to China includes a US$2.6bn currency swap. The government is aiming to offer US$500m of Panda bonds in the Chinese market in late 2023 or early 2024. It will also issue more sovereign sukuk (Islamic securities) following a successful US$1.5bn debut in February 2023.
- Gulf Arab investors will seek to expand their presence in Egypt's investment banking sector. This follows the recent acquisition by Chimera, an Abu Dhabi-based finance company, of a 55.9% stake in Beltone, one of Egypt's leading investment banks. Chimera has also acquired a minority stake in the market leader, EFG Hermes. However, an earlier bid by First Abu Dhabi Bank to acquire a controlling stake in EFG Hermes was withdrawn in April 2022.

Overview: The score and both regional and global rankings rise, reflecting the depth of Egypt's labour pool. From a business perspective, the Egyptian labour market offers an abundance of young workers, with graduates, post-graduates and skilled and semi-skilled workers available at competitive wages.
Strengths: The unemployment rate has fallen sharply in recent years, but there is still plenty of scope to raise the level of labour participation. After reaching almost 13% in 2016, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7% at end-March 2020, but then soared to almost 10% owing to the effects of the pandemic. The preponderance of agriculture, which accounts for about one-fifth of the workforce, helped to maintain employment levels. As tourism, manufacturing and retail recovered unemployment fell to just over 7% on average in 2021-22. The labour participation rate also returned to the pre-pandemic level of about 43%, but this remains low by developing market standards.
Weaknesses: With an estimated 30% of Egyptians living below the World Bank-defined poverty line, workers face strong pressures to emigrate. Egypt is a major source of irregular migration across the Mediterranean to Europe. Outward migration includes skilled workers and professionals from sectors including health and education. Remittances from the estimated 9m Egyptians working abroad provide an important stream of foreign exchange (US$32bn in 2022), but are also a symptom of poor state of the domestic economy.
What to watch
- A new labour law is set to go into effect in 2024, following extensive debate in parliament since it was introduced by the government in early 2022. The law will make it easier for employers to dismiss workers, and sets stiffer conditions for strikes. The law also provides for an increase in the normal retirement age, from 60 to 65. Details of the timeframe for this change will be spelled out in the executive regulations.
- The system for setting the minimum wage for the private sector is separate from the government-dictated rules for public-sector wages. In practice, the notionally independent National Council for Wages tends to fall more or less in line with decisions taken for the state payroll, although typically with a delay to allow for consultation with business. The minimum wage for the private sector was raised by 11% in July 2023, to E£3,000 per month, following a 12.5% increase in January. A further increase is likely following Mr Sisi's announcement in September that the state sector minimum wage should be raised from E£3,500 per month to E£4,000. Private companies are also obliged to pay annual bonuses equivalent to 3% of employees' insurance contributions.

Overview: Egypt's score for the quality of its infrastructure improves markedly in 2024-28, with the global and regional rankings rising by 11 and two places respectively. This reflects heavy ongoing investment in upgrading infrastructure, with a particular focus on energy and transport, but gaps remain. Energy has been a principal focus of the investment drive. Power generation capacity has almost doubled since 2014, to 58 GW, and is comfortably above the peak load, which reached 36 GW in mid-2023. However, this was not sufficient to prevent rolling power cuts during the summer of 2023, as there was a shortfall in natural gas supply during a surge in demand. Preliminary agreements have been signed for the development at least 25 GW of new wind power capacity, and Russian contractors are working on an estimated US$25bn project to build Egypt's first nuclear power station. The first of four 1.2-GW units is likely to near completion at the end of our forecast period. New high-speed rail projects, including a freight-focused line from the Gulf of Suez to the Mediterranean, will start up in the next two to three years. Port capacity will increase with the completion of new projects at East Port Said, Sokhna, Damietta and Alexandria.
Strengths: Private investor engagement in infrastructure projects has boosted growth in this sector. Most of the existing solar capacity, including a 1.65-GW, 41-lot solar park, has been developed by private firms. Private investors from Gulf states, Europe and Asia are involved in a series of major new wind projects, some of which could be linked to green hydrogen facilities. Private investors are involved in all of the new maritime port expansions. Egypt's first dry port, at 6 October City, is being developed as a public-private partnership (PPP). More dry ports are in the pipeline.
Weaknesses: A recent fall in Egypt's natural gas output poses a risk to energy security. After a recovery since 2016, largely due to the Zohr field, gas output fell by 5% in 2022, to 64.5bn cu metres. It is likely to dip below 60bn cu metres in 2023, given technical issues at Zohr and declines at mature fields.
What to watch
- The government is looking to garner billions of US dollars from selling energy assets. These include three 4.8-GW combined-cycle power stations built by Germany's Siemens. Bids are under evaluation for the first of these, at Beni Suef. There are also multiple bidders for two wind farms, Gabal el-Zeit (580 MW) and Zaafarana (545 MW). Critical issues for these sales will be the asset price and the terms of the new power sales agreements.
- Major new urban developments, notably the new administrative capital and New Al Alamein, will put considerable strains on infrastructure, in particular water supply and wastewater. This comes amid uncertainty about the effects on Egypt's water supply of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which will restrict flows from the Blue Nile. The government has launched a programme to build 21 desalination plants, with a combined capacity of 8.85m cu metres/day. They will be undertaken on a PPP basis.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
Overview: Egypt's technological readiness score for the forecast period improves from a low base, owing to expected innovation, driven both by the government and by private ventures. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology will prioritise telecommunications, digital citizenship, human capacity, industry development and innovation. To date progress has been slow, as indicated by Egypt's low ranking in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's 2022 Global Innovation Index, at 89th of 132 countries, just below Kenya, but above Nigeria and Algeria. However, progress is being made in institutional capacity, market sophistication and business complexity, with rapid growth in the financial technology sector.
Strengths: The government envisages the technology sector-including the development of new information and communication technology investment clusters, such as a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone-as a leading driver of economic growth. One of the largest projects in the zone is a plant designed to manufacture 60 km of fibre-optic cable a year, built by a joint venture including the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, a military-industrial group. Trial production started in early 2023.
Weaknesses: Download speeds lag behind many of Egypt's regional peers, although its performance for mobile speed is better than Tunisia, Nigeria, Kenya and Algeria, and it is ahead of India, Turkey, Morocco, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Iraq, Lebanon, Iran and Algeria for broadband speed.
What to watch
- New investors are lining up to take stakes in the telecoms sector. Sovereign wealth funds in Qatar and Saudi Arabia are reported to have expressed interest in buying Telecom Egypt's 45% stake in Vodafone Egypt, the market leader for mobile services. The remaining 55% is owned by South Africa-based Vodacom, which acquired it from its UK-based parent, Vodafone, for US$3.1bn.
- The fintech segment will continue to expand rapidly. Egypt currently has more than 150 fintech start-ups, among which the major established players include Fawry, e-Finance AMAN and MNT-Halan. Investment funds in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi have acquired stakes in Fawry and e-Finance, and both companies are preparing to launch operations in Saudi Arabia.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Early in the forecast period Egypt will face intense fiscal and balance-of-payments stresses. In December 2022 Egypt began a four-year, US$3bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF, but political will to follow through with programme targets, particularly regarding exchange-rate flexibility and fiscal adjustment, has been lacking. The programme is therefore at a standstill. Under pressure from the government the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reverted to a fixed exchange rate in March to shield consumers from rising prices. A September announcement that benefits and salaries would be uprated from October-widening the budget deficit well beyond the target level for fiscal year 2023/24 (July-June)-similarly shows that government priorities ahead of the election are incompatible with the EFF. A first review is only expected to take place once there is movement on reform after the poll, probably in early 2024.
The credit default swap spread on sovereign debt is currently at more than 1,500 basis points, leaving the international capital market largely off limits. Foreign reserves are relatively low, at a forecast 4.3 months of imports in 2024. A maturity wall on sovereign debt will be reached in that year. As Mr Sisi's administration promotes itself as a safe custodian of the economy, and as default would entail political risks, we expect the election to be a turning point, after which there will be a large devaluation of the currency to bring the IMF programme back and reassure foreign investors. The government intends to sell stakes in 50 state-owned companies and raise US$5bn by mid-2024. Only US$2.5bn has been realised so far, but the target should be achieved once the currency becomes more market-led. Foreign direct investment will be an important bridge in meeting financing needs; interest-rate cuts are expected in the US, which should encourage demand for emerging-market assets in the medium term, although monetary loosening in the US is not expected until the third quarter of 2024.
Egypt is expected to run primary budget surpluses of varying extents, although lower than envisaged in the EFF, to reduce a large debt overhang, which is estimated at more than 90% of GDP. Policy will tilt towards austerity, improved tax collection and a push for private-sector-led economic growth. The IMF will probably tolerate fuel subsidies into 2024, making the EFF politically easier for the regime, but subsidy spending has become unsustainable. In 2024/25 Egypt is expected to move towards market pricing for bread and fuel. Regulated bread prices will be replaced with means-tested welfare support for low-income groups. Public debt will fall but stay high in 2024-28, ending 2028 at just over 80% of GDP. Future shocks would not be absorbed easily.

Budget balance -6.7 -8.3 -7.5 -6.7 -6.0 -5.9
Government debt 90.0 88.1 85.3 82.7 80.8 80.2
Egypt will post large budget deficits in the medium term, given spiralling interest costs, costly fuel and electricity subsidies, capital spending around the development of a new administrative capital and higher welfare and salary spending. The budget for 2023/24 is based on optimistic revenue projections, given the challenging economic backdrop, and understates the subsidy and debt-service bill, which will elevate the spending/GDP ratio. We project a fiscal deficit/GDP ratio of 8.3% in that year, compared with the Ministry of Finance's target of 7%.
The spending/GDP ratio is expected to stay high throughout 2024-28, falling only modestly in the longer term as lower interest rates ease debt-service costs. The current spending bill will stay large as subsidies are replaced by more means-tested support, and capital spending will remain an important feature of budgets, given numerous ongoing government-backed housing and transport projects. Revenue gains will be the main driver of fiscal consolidation. Digitalisation of the tax system and other administration efficiencies will be central to increasing revenue in the short to medium term. We expect the revenue/GDP ratio to outstrip the average for the ten years to 2020/21, helped by a pick-up in economic growth later in the forecast period. Given these gains, we expect the primary balance to record surpluses of varying extents, and the overall budget deficit to narrow, to 5.9% of GDP in 2027/28.
We suspect that budget deficits are being part-financed by the CBE, judging by low demand for government debt and strong growth in money supply. Monetisation is expected to continue until market sentiment improves in 2024. We expect that the sovereign will issue international bonds (including sukuk) once monetary conditions in the US begin to ease, which is expected from late 2024, and that external finance will be tapped heavily once available to get around high local borrowing costs.

3-month Treasury-bill rate (year-end) 23.6 19.2 13.0 12.2 12.0 12.2
Since 2022 the CBE has added 1,100 basis points to the policy rate, which now stands at 19.75%. The approach to monetary tightening has been fitful, with rates held in four of the six monetary policy committee meetings so far in 2023, most recently in September. We view hesitancy to act in the face of high and rising inflation as a function of public financial stress, with debt service at up to 65% of government revenue. We continue to forecast that 50 basis points will be added to the policy rate by year-end, which is gentle considering inflation of 37.4% in August (up by one percentage point from July). The CBE is expected to largely wait until base effects reduce inflation. We do not expect interest-rate cuts until 2025, once disinflation is cemented.
We expect the CBE to broadly let the pound float in the medium to long term (although this will be uneven in application), allowing monetary conditions to be generally looser than over 2018-21, when policy was focused on exchange-rate stability. We expect the policy rate to fall to a reasonably low level (for Egypt), of 9.5%, in 2026. We project that foreign reserves will cover 4.5 months of imports on average in 2025-28, compared with an average of 6.1 months in 2018-21, when real short-term real interest rates were among the world's highest.

We forecast growth of 3.1% in 2023/24, down from an estimated 4% in 2022/23. High inflation and tight monetary policy will depress demand from households and firms, and real government spending outside of debt service will be limited. Net exports will be the primary driver of growth, supported by past devaluations of the Egyptian pound. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) output is expected to decline owing to low domestic natural gas production, but tourism should register a considerable growth benefit. Import volumes will contract, in line with currency weakness and slumping fixed investment. Tight monetary policy over the first half of 2024/25 will keep growth at 4.3% that year, higher than 2023/24, as inflation eases and interest rates are cut from 2025.
Domestic demand will be stronger later in the forecast period as the CBE pursues a pro-growth monetary policy, with investment supported by measures to improve the business environment by speeding up bureaucratic processes and continued privatisation. A greater commitment to exchange-rate flexibility should also encourage a continued strong real export performance. We expect economic growth to peak in 2026/27, at 6.2%, subsiding t0 5.1% in 2027/28 as global economic growth and external demand slow.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The manufacturing sector (excluding oil refining) accounts for about 13% of GDP, but the challenges facing the sector are numerous. Local manufacturing suffers from quality issues and is often unable to match competition from imported goods. Expected exchange-rate flexibility over the medium term should confer a competitive advantage on export-oriented industries, but currency losses will also push up costs of importing equipment and raw materials. Fuel and electricity are subsidised, but energy-intensive industries such as fertilisers, petrochemicals, aluminium and iron and steel are charged US-dollar-based prices for supplies of natural gas. The automotive sector is likely to continue to struggle, as it will remain heavily reliant on imported components, and Egypt will find it hard to match the performance of other regional manufacturers, notably Morocco. Government efforts to attract Chinese companies to set up electric vehicle projects in Egypt have made little headway. Overall, we expect the manufacturing sector to perform relatively well during the forecast period, helped by foreign investment in upgrading existing industries and in setting up new projects in development zones, but Egypt will not become a hub. There is scope for Egypt to generate more value-added from agro-industry. Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP.
Tourism and new cities will boost the construction sector The construction sector will continue to be a major driver of economic growth, on the back of continued investment in infrastructure. This will include the new cities programme. The initial phase of the new administrative capital is nearing completion, based on investments by the state-owned master developer. The next phase will depend more on the activities of private real estate developers. The construction sector will also benefit from growth in tourism, as annual visitor numbers are likely to climb to 20m-25m over the next five years, from an estimated 15m in 2023. Construction accounts for about 7.5% of GDP, roughly the same as oil, gas and mining (extractive industries).
The energy and mining sectors have the potential to expand rapidly, but this will depend on geology, levels of investment and market conditions. Oil output has stabilised at about 600,000 barrels/day, and there is the prospect of increased output from the Western Desert, based on a new agreement reached with the leading operator in that area, Apache (US). Major firms including ExxonMobil and Chevron (both US), TotalEnergies (France), Eni (Italy), and BP and Shell (both UK) are preparing exploration campaigns in the Mediterranean, where most of Egypt's natural gas reserves have been found. Fresh discoveries would usher in a new phase of development, which is needed to stem the recent decline in natural gas output. Supply is currently being supplemented by imports from Israel. These are set to increase, which will allow for exports to continue from the LNG plants at Idku and Damietta. The LNG plants could even be expanded if increased Egyptian output could be combined with supplies from fields in Cyprus.
Green hydrogen is emerging as a potential focus for the energy sector Egypt's aspiration to become an energy hub includes the potential development of green hydrogen. At least ten agreements in principle have been reached with investors from Europe, the Gulf and Asia to build green hydrogen plants in the Suez Canal region, with a view to turning this into a centre for exports and for green bunkering. Making this happen will require a major increase in renewable energy generation. Work on major wind and solar projects led by Gulf Arab investors will start during the next five years.
Despite instability the outlook for the tourism sector is positive Services will remain an important employer and foreign exchange-earner, particularly through tourism, on which more than 2m jobs depend. Inward travel accounted for more than 16% of all goods and services export receipts in 2022. The outlook is brightened by past and expected devaluations of the Egyptian pound, which should keep Egypt an attractive destination despite cost-of-living pressures in target markets. Instability in the region caused by the Israel-Hamas war will be a point of uncertainty in the short term, but a large number of flight options-including from Russia since mid-2021 (after these were paused after a terrorist attack in 2015)-are a positive factor.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Consumer prices 36.8 26.9 9.7 8.3 7.3 7.5
Strong inflationary pressures will persist into 2024. The driving forces include devaluations of the pound in 2022 and early 2023, periodic rises in subsidised prices for fuel and electricity, and the liquidity caused by deficit monetisation. Inflation was at 37.4% in August, and we forecast a rate of 41.5% at year-end. Base effects should kick in before March 2024, but devaluation of the pound-which we expect soon after Mr Sisi's re-election-will keep inflation high, at an average of 26.9% over that year. We do not expect headline inflation to fall under the 9% target ceiling until late 2025.
The inflation target is planned to be lowered to 5%± 2 percentage points from 2025, but we are not convinced that this will be viable. We expect the CBE to broadly favour economic growth in the medium to long term, involving a shift away from a high real interest-rate environment that was used in 2018-21 to hold the pound steady at the cost of wide budget deficits. Inflation will average 7.7% in 2026-28.

Purchasing power parity E£:US$ (av) 4.94 5.37 5.71 5.96 6.15 6.32
The Egyptian pound lost more than 90% of its value between January 2022 and February 2023. The CBE has since held the pound steady at E£30-31:US$1, compared with about E£40:US$1 on the parallel market. Given deeply negative real interest rates, low foreign reserves and impatience among Gulf backers, the fixed exchange rate will come at the expense of hard-currency availability in the official market. We expect the currency to be devalued by almost 20% in early 2024, after the election, with a view to restarting the IMF programme, appealing to investor confidence and regaining access to market finance. This will take the rate to E£37.6:US$1 at end-2024, roughly in line with the parallel rate by then, assuming that monetary loosening in the US boosts demand for emerging-market assets.
The longer-term forecast is based on more determined currency flexibility as policy moves permanently away from the high real interest-rate environment that kept the pound relatively stable in 2017-21. The pound will weaken fairly continuously, reflecting higher domestic inflation than in trading partners, high public debt, current-account deficits and lower portfolio inflows than in the past. However, the rate of annual loss against the US dollar will be far gentler than over the balance-of-payments "crunch point" of 2022-24. We expect the exchange rate to end 2028 at E£47.3:US$1.

Economic forecast: External sector From an estimated 2.6% of GDP in 2023, the current-account deficit is expected to shrink to 1.9% of GDP in 2024, based on a weaker pound that year. The CBE's decision to fix the exchange rate over most of 2023 has resulted in a build-up of real effective exchange-rate appreciation that a devaluation in early 2024 should partially correct. With high interest rates, import demand will be subdued, and service exports will benefit from improved external competitiveness. However, goods exports will decline as LNG prices and output fall.
Over 2025-28 the current-account deficit will widen to an average of 2.9% of GDP, still shy of the ten-year average to 2023 (3.6% of GDP). A recovery in domestic demand-particularly private-sector investment as interest rates are cut and privatisation proceeds-from 2025 will be reflected in a higher import bill, widening the structural trade deficit. Privatisation will also engender high primary income debits as a greater share of foreign ownership in the economy increases dividend repatriation. However, the services surplus will be relatively wide, given external competitiveness and high tourism receipts. Increased transit fees and expanded waterways on the Suez Canal will offer further ongoing support.
Financing will be challenging early in the forecast period. Egypt will depend on short-term debt (foreign-currency deposits at the CBE) in the short term, along with proceeds from privatisation. Assuming that global monetary conditions ease into the latter half of 2024, Egypt is expected to issue international bonds to plug financing gaps over the longer term.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Egypt Stocks and flows In July 2018 the government changed its methodology for assessing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to include all undistributed realised earnings (whereas previously it counted only reinvested earnings), and equity stakes of below 10%. After a fall in FDI during 2020 and 2021, net inflows rose sharply in 2022, to US$11.4bn, and 2023 is estimated to have been another strong year, at US$9.2bn. The outlook is positive for FDI. Assets will become more attractively priced once the Egyptian pound is devalued-as is expected in 2024-and the Central Bank of Egypt commits to exchange-rate flexibility, and 2024 is set to be a bumper year for FDI, with inflows of US$12.3bn projected, followed by an average of US$8.3bn per year in 2025-28.
In recent years FDI has been concentrated in hydrocarbons and services, notably finance. As a privatisation agenda progresses inflows are likely to become more diverse. The government intends to sell stakes in the transport, real estate, technology, power, tourism, manufacturing and agriculture sectors, and in financial services and petrochemicals companies. Up to 50 companies are to be sold by early 2024, according to government plans, with six sold as at October 2023. ADQ, an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund, has been a heavy investor in recent years, along with the sovereign wealth funds of other Gulf States. Efforts to improve the environment for foreign investors are running in parallel with the privatisation plan. Legislation has been aimed at creating a more level playing field between state and private enterprises by abolishing the tax exemptions that have given state-owned firms a competitive advantage. However, measures have fallen short of compelling all companies owned by the military (which has extensive business interests) to do the same, as defence, national security and "essential" infrastructure projects will be exempt. Military companies may also be shielded from retroactive taxes and fees. Separate measures designed to attract FDI include the streamlining of bureaucratic procedures-which are often cited as a prominent obstacle to doing business locally-with fast-track options for various permits and licenses, as well as streamlining and rationalising of tax payments.
Origin and distribution European and Arab investors have accounted for about two-thirds of total inward FDI flows to Egypt over the past five years, and the Gulf is likely to become the biggest source as the privatisation agenda progresses. Italy, the UK and The Netherlands have consistently featured among the largest sources of FDI, reflecting the scale of the investments by Eni (Italy), BP (UK) and Shell (UK) in the oil and gas sector in recent years. Inflows from the US have averaged about US$2bn a year over the past five years. This figure could increase in the forecast period following the recent entry into the market of two major US oil companies, ExxonMobil and Chevron. Another US company, Apache, is also stepping up its investments following the renewal of its concession agreements. The UAE, which is Egypt's closest regional ally, has been the largest source of investment among Arab countries by a large margin, followed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with Qatar a particularly notable source of potential growth. The Public Investment Fund (Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund) will also be increasingly active in the Egyptian market. Chinese companies have shown some interest in investing in Egypt, with China's share of total FDI inflows rising from 0.5% to 3% in the decade to 2022. Oil and gas have typically accounted for about 60% of FDI inflows, but we expect their share to diminish over the forecast period. However, flows into infrastructure, technology, financial services, logistics, mining, manufacturing, healthcare and real estate will increase.
Determinants Besides market size and the availability of cheap labour, the main determinants of FDI include the business and legal environment and the availability of foreign exchange for imports and profit repatriation. Political considerations also play an important role, as Gulf Arab investment is geared partly towards maintaining stability in Egypt through long-term economic support. Under the current regime, the government is seeking to resolve a number of long-running disputes with Gulf Arab (and other foreign) investors, as part of a broader effort to encourage regional players to increase their activity in Egypt. Efforts to establish new free zones-such as the Suez Canal Development Zone-could help to draw investments, and the Sovereign Fund of Egypt, which was established in 2018, has been designed a channel for FDI. Downside risks to FDI will persist, and include business environment deficiencies, weak lending by domestic banks and the risk of the post-coronavirus recovery stalling.
Impact FDI has helped to transform Egypt into a more modern market economy, and inflows under the privatisation plan will help to bail Egypt out of balance-of-payment stress in the near to medium term (until global monetary conditions loosen slowly from late 2024). Foreign firms are aiding economic diversification, improving the quality of human capital through better managerial and technical skills, increasing employment opportunities and assisting the transfer of technology. Egypt has a growing base of technology entrepreneurs who have the potential to create new jobs and investment opportunities. One recent example is Swivl, a transport app founded by Egyptians that recently secured a Nasdaq listing. Investment into the technology sector will bring international expertise into the field, strengthening its long-term growth potential. Similarly, Egypt's well-established healthcare and pharmaceutical sector is likely to draw in investment, in particular, allowing the expansion of domestic manufacturing capabilities. The current acquisition drive by Gulf Arab sovereign wealth funds is providing much-needed support to Egypt's balance of payments. However, there is a risk that the growing influence of these Gulf investors could breed resentment among sections of the Egyptian population, and foreign ownership (and profit repatriation) will add to Egypt's current-account deficits in the long term and potentially reinforce dependence on capital inflows for finance.

Egypt's population will reach more than 110m by the end of the forecast period Egypt's growing population provides opportunities for economic development, but is also among the biggest challenges facing the government, as it places additional strains on the labour market and public services such as healthcare and education. EIU forecasts that the population will rise from 103.6m in 2022 to 115.3m in 2028, an annual growth rate of 1.8%, which is higher than the average for most developing countries.
Almost one-third of the population is below the age of 15, and more than half is below 24. About 700,000 new entrants join the labour market annually, requiring job opportunities both for unskilled and skilled entrants. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of more than 13% in 2014 to 7.3% in 2022, but is expected to rise as the economy slows amid high inflation and tighter credit conditions. Although real wages are low, attempts by the government to raise the minimum wage and widen enforceability will be a friction that leads to higher joblessness, with a rate of 9.1% expected in 2024. Privatisation as a medium-term policy objective for the government could unlock job opportunities, but might also lead to operational streamlining and retrenchments in state-dominated sectors, which are often labour-intensive, such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing.
Outward migration to the Gulf states, Europe and North America will fall Outward migration from Egypt to neighbouring Gulf Arab states, Europe and North America is likely to resume, but indigenisation of the workforce in the Gulf means that there will be limitations. Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians could be forced to return from the Gulf as a consequence of such efforts. Kuwait has already announced a plan to replace expatriates with locals in all municipality jobs; 3,000 Egyptians were deported in 2022, and hundreds of thousands could lose their jobs. Expatriate remittances are among the major sources of foreign-exchange receipts for Egypt.
Egypt has a highly urbanised population, with nearly 10m people living in Cairo alone. The current government has taken steps to promote internal migration from the overcrowded Nile Valley into unpopulated tracts of desert. These include a demarcation plan to create three new governorates-Central Sinai, Al Alamein and Al Wahat-bringing the total to 30. The government is also undertaking a number of major industrial projects outside urban centres, such as the Suez Canal Development Zone, with the aim of boosting employment opportunities in long-neglected rural areas. The government has embarked on the construction of 14 new satellite cities. The largest of these is the new administrative capital, where some government ministries have relocated and which is envisaged as eventually housing some 6m people.

A slowdown in domestic demand looms Egypt's large population and a record of reasonably strong economic growth make it one of the largest in Africa, alongside South Africa and Nigeria. An expected devaluation of the Egyptian pound in 2024 (of about 15%) will cause GDP in US-dollar terms to dip in 2024. However, stronger economic growth later in the forecast period will leave the economy 20% larger by 2028 than in 2023, and raise GDP per head in purchasing-power-parity terms. However, much of the increase in GDP will derive from export-oriented sectors. Beneath the headline GDP numbers, high inflation and tight credit conditions will weigh on private demand. Household consumption is expected to fall in 2024 and only recover to its 2023 level by 2027. Imports are estimated to have contracted sharply in 2023, and another drop in value terms is expected in 2024 as demand reaches a forecast-period nadir; this will be followed by a recovery along with the wider economy.
Even with monetary and fiscal adjustments reducing income per head in the short term, as the most populous country in the Middle East and North Africa, Egypt's large size makes it an important regional market, with huge potential (particularly in the second half of the forecast period) that will continue to grow over the long term. The population is easily accessible, not least because it is located in an extremely concentrated geographical area. However, the headline figures mask wide income disparities between rich and poor.
Wide income disparities remain The spending power of a large minority of Egyptians, residing mainly in newly built cities and neighbourhoods such as 6th of October City, is comparable to that of consumers in the industrialised world. They will be affected by currency devaluation, high inflation and constrained credit conditions in the short to medium term, but retain substantial disposable income.
Retail markets are still underdeveloped Egypt's retail sector is under-saturated, and assets are under-priced. This could provide investment opportunities, with e-commerce finally beginning to gain substantial ground. New urban developments will also provide abundant opportunities for retail investment.

Basic household needs will continue to dominate consumer spending In common with the rest of the region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of consumer expenditure. This will remain the case, particularly with intense cost-of-living pressures early in the forecast period. Food price growth in 2023 exceeded 70% by the third quarter. Spending on basic household items, primarily food and beverages, as well as spending on housing, will continue to dominate household expenditure even in later years. This reflects a substantial chunk of the population living at or just above the poverty line, with disposable income sufficient only for subsistence. However, once the macroeconomic picture stabilises more disposable income will be redirected towards other spending categories, in particularly high-end consumer goods, in line with the trend prior to the inflationary spiral. We expect spending on healthcare to increase, reflecting the impact of the rollout of a universal health insurance scheme. Spending on leisure and education will also rise markedly. Transport and communications will increase in importance as the forecast period progresses. As car ownership rises and demand for mobile and internet technology takes off, a rising proportion of household income will be spent on these items.

Initial conditions: EIU judges exchange-rate and fiscal reform to be inescapable. The political will to get behind unpopular reform will strengthen after the December presidential election. Devaluation of the Egyptian pound is expected to encourage the foreign investment needed to support a privatisation agenda and restart Egypt's extended fund facility with the IMF. Painful initially, pro-market reforms will encourage a reasonably fast rate of economic growth in 2024-30. However, we take a cautious view about Egypt's long-term growth prospects. The country has a chronically low national savings rate, of about 4% of GDP, which will limit domestic investment and opportunities for long-term growth. Pension systems are underdeveloped, as the informal sector is large, and trust in pension systems is also low after past scandals. Total factor productivity will increase fairly rapidly over the 2024-30 "reform years", but there is limited reason to expect these gains to be sustained into the much longer term. Egypt has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency to backtrack on exchange-rate reform and fiscal control, for example. The autocratic nature of the regime generates a large and ineffectual bureaucracy, arbitrariness in the legal system, constricting regulation and cronyism. As Egypt approaches the limits that its low savings rate can provide in terms of economic growth, and assuming that there are limits to foreign direct investment as a driver for the economy, modest total factor productivity gains will hold back long-term growth.
Egypt's population is young, fast-growing and densely packed Demographic trends: Egypt's high population density has some advantages: access to consumers is relatively easy, especially in the two urban centres, Cairo and Alexandria. Population growth will slow relative to 2023-30 in the longer term, given higher levels of development and government family-planning policies, but stay high, reflecting cultural norms. Demographic trends are broadly favourable to growth prospects, as the working-age population will rise more rapidly than the overall population over the forecast period, creating a youthful demographic bulge in the labour force. The government will press ahead with projects to develop areas of the desert beyond the Nile Valley to alleviate pressure on infrastructure. This will be supported by government efforts to reclaim 1.5m feddans (630,000 ha) of land. With most of the land surface uninhabited, the government might push ahead with long-awaited plans to create several new governorates. The idea was mooted in 2005 and later revived by the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has since pushed ahead with major urban construction projects, including a new administrative capital.
External conditions: External conditions will remain dependent on demand from major export markets in North America and the EU, which is Egypt's largest trading partner and market for tourism and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Although demand for Egypt's LNG will stay high as Europe searches for alternatives to Russian energy supply, there will be constraints to natural gas supply and in the near to medium term this will weigh on exports. In the longer term exploration efforts mean that new fields should come on stream, with Egypt holding large untapped reserves. However, with local gas demand rising, especially given increasingly hot summers, Egypt will not be a dependable supplier of LNG. Investment into creating extra capacity (beyond the 12m tonnes/year already installed) is unlikely.
Wealthier Gulf states will view Egypt as a high-yielding destination for investments, but their outbound investment capacity will be tied to both oil prices and their ability to diversify their economies over the long term, neither of which is assured. Tensions with Turkey will be a concern, particularly in terms of Egypt's ambitions to leverage its growing natural gas resource capacity and processing facilities to solidify its role as a regional energy hub. Despite these concerns, this will be an important area of growth and co-operation with countries such as Israel, Cyprus, Greece and other southern European countries.
The government remains heavily influenced by vested interests Institutions and policy trends: Present and future governments will work to streamline the bureaucracy and boost the accountability of public officials, but within limits, as politics will get in the way (as the large public sector is an important source of patronage). There are deeply entrenched interest groups in the government, and the influence of business lobby groups and of the military on the state is powerful. Democratic accountability will stay low, with authority centred on the presidency. Threats to long-term political and social stability might persist, reflecting the stand-off between the state and its liberal opponents, as well as high unemployment rates and high levels of poverty.
Long-term growth will depend in part on government effectiveness Long-term performance: There is potential for the economy to expand fairly dramatically over the long term. Egypt is a prime location as a base to export to Asia, Africa and Europe, and has a plentiful and low-cost workforce. However, success will also depend on a lasting commitment to economic reform and major improvements in political and institutional effectiveness. The government must increase the efficiency of the bureaucracy, develop a more effective commercial legal system, continue to withdraw the state from economic activity and reform the public finances. Progress is likely to be flawed, and we expect real GDP growth to average 3.3% a year in 2030-50. Total factor productivity gains will be limited in the long term, assuming that the autocratic nature of the regime presents a meaningful constraint.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Egypt has been struggling with rising temperatures in recent years, with summer heat typically averaging above 35˚C. This results in spikes in energy consumption by both households and industrial users during the hot summer season. Successive heat waves and worsening climate conditions globally could create new health dangers for residents of the country, as well as the broader Middle East and North Africa region, particularly as the summer season lengthens, humidity levels rise further and growing water scarcity causes problems for food production, industry and municipal use. This might also reduce arable land in Egypt, which is already facing the threat of worsening water scarcity as construction and the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (located downstream on the Nile, in Ethiopia) is now complete. Egypt is especially concerned that Ethiopia has not agreed to terms that will dictate water filling according to hydrological and climatic conditions. In addition to aggressively pursuing an agreement on the issue (if needed by threat of military force against the dam), Egypt will accelerate efforts to develop other water sources, especially desalination, with plans for several new desalination facilities over the next few years. Higher temperatures will boost demand for energy further as time goes by and weather conditions deteriorate, circumscribing energy exports. The government is increasingly looking to renewable sources, especially solar, to meet power demand, and is also beginning work on nuclear energy provision, but remains heavily dependent on natural gas. As part of management of the greater demand for energy, local authorities will need to diversify the energy mix to include more renewable sources of power. According to EIU's climate change model the Egyptian economy will be 5.4% smaller in 2050 than without the effects of climate change.
Technological developments The government envisages the technology sector-including the development of new information and communications technology (ICT) investment clusters, such as a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone-as one of the main drivers of economic growth over the next five years. Telecommunications and the ICT sector have grown rapidly in recent years as 4G rollout has accelerated. Future growth is highly likely, considering the growing interest by foreigners in Egypt as a budding offshore information technology (IT) centre. Despite its modest performance by regional comparison, Egypt has been gaining increasing attention by foreign companies as an outsourcing centre for IT operations, owing in part to the abundance of skilled workers and the country's proximity to European markets.
There are currently more than 6,000 Egyptian companies active in the ICT sector, most of them in activities related to the internet. E-commerce and financial technology (fintech) have grown strongly during the pandemic crisis, albeit from a low base. The government estimates that Egypt earns about US$1.5bn a year from exports of ICT-related services, and this figure is likely to climb markedly in the long term. The government is targeting growth of 12% a year in the sector, which accounts for about 7% of GDP. Exports of digital services have also grown strongly. The government is rolling out e-government services for households in select areas; internet penetration is still fairly modest, although it is used more widely in the business sector. The number of internet users has expanded rapidly, with the government estimating that almost 78% of individuals were using the internet on a daily basis in May 2023, a large increase even on recent years. Following fast growth in digital uptake during the pandemic, about 45% of households had fixed broadband at end-2022, compared with about 20% a decade earlier, and about 65% of households used mobile broadband (with nearly all households having access to a mobile phone). Household home internet coverage in urban areas is far higher than in rural areas, where improved mobile services could play a particularly important role.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The previous centre-right coalition lost the September 2021 parliamentary election and was replaced by a minority coalition of the Labour Party and the agrarian-populist Centre Party, supported by the Socialist Left Party (SV). Despite the SV's aim to bring an end to oil exploration, the ongoing war in Ukraine and the resulting focus on energy security across Europe have increased the importance of Norway's hydrocarbons sector, which is likely to slow any move away from oil. In the medium term policies to diversify the economy and accelerate green initiatives remain likely.

- Norway's business environment score improves in the forecast period (2023-27), in response to ongoing reforms and as uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine and rapid monetary tightening dissipate. The country's global ranking remains steady at 14th, with Norway ranked as the eighth most attractive business location in western Europe. A shift to a left-leaning government is driving modest changes to tax and labour market policy. Strengths of the business environment include stable and transparent political and regulatory structures, openness to trade and foreign investment, a low regulatory burden, a skilled labour force and high-quality network infrastructure, backed by the country's substantial oil wealth. Weaker aspects are Norway's small market size, high labour costs and restricted access to some product markets.

- The Norwegian economy grew by a robust 3.2% in 2022, owing to base effects following the removal of the final covid restrictions and soaring oil and gas export revenue following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. EIU expects growth to slow in 2023 as private consumption is held back by accelerating inflation and a negative wealth effect following a decline in home prices, while a decline in hydrocarbons prices negatively affects the external sector's contribution to growth. Nevertheless, growth in 2023-24 will remain firm compared with European peers, owing to the significant degree of accumulated wealth and ongoing revenue from the oil and gas sector. Norges Bank (the central bank) will conclude its tightening cycle in late 2023, with rates stable at 4.5%, which will persist until the bank begins to loosen policy in late 2024.

- Annual population growth has slowed over the past decade, mainly in response to reduced net immigration, alongside a gradual fall in the "natural increase". In 2021 net migration rebounded from a pandemic-induced multi-decade low in 2020, and is likely to have surged to an all-time high in 2022, owing to an influx of Ukrainian refugees and an end to pandemic travel restrictions. We expect it to return to trend in 2023 before gradually declining thereafter. A gradual ageing of the population will continue amid a slowly declining fertility rate and increasing life expectancy. Compared with other Nordic countries, Norway's demography is better suited to future growth, with a higher share of the population of working age. Nevertheless, an ageing population will push up costs in the pension and healthcare systems over the forecast period.

Household consumption per head (US$) 34,310 33,360 38,050 42,700 44,830 46,560

- Market opportunities are constrained by the small size of the population (5.5m in 2022). However, Norwegian households are the fifth wealthiest in the world, measured by GDP per head in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The consumer goods market is modest in size, similar to those of Denmark and Portugal, and about one-tenth that of the UK. Household consumption per head (at US$34,315 in 2022) is among the highest in western Europe and above all its Nordic peers. Norway's private consumption as a share of GDP is lower than in most west European economies, mainly owing to a large public sector.

- High labour market participation means that future growth will depend on gains in productivity and investment, both of which will steadily accrue over the forecast period. Diminishing oil and gas reserves will force continued reform of the healthcare and pension systems, with the vast Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) supporting the public finances over this period. Further integration of technology and a steady improvement in the population's skills levels will encourage long-term growth.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously from 1935 to 1965, and dominated until 2001, when a minority coalition of the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals came to power. The Labour Party returned to office in 2005 in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party-the first majority government for two decades. The 2013 election produced a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the far-right Progress Party, which remained in office after the 2017 vote. The election in September 2021 saw a swing in support to left-leaning parties, culminating in a minority coalition government comprising the Labour Party and the Centre Party.
Political structure: There is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system: 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The September 2021 election was dominated by the issues of climate change, energy policy and inequality, with the role of Norway's large oil and gas sector expected to come under increasing policy scrutiny, although this has been mitigated in the near term by European energy security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Amid calls for an immediate end to exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf, the consensus remains to develop rather than discontinue the industry. Considering the economy's still-high dependence on the petroleum sector, this is likely to sit alongside policies aimed at further diversifying the mainland economy, accelerating green initiatives, raising the tax burden on the wealthy and strengthening the welfare system. Spending from Norway's huge oil fund will remain within fiscal guidelines.
Taxation: The headline corporation tax rate is 22%, having been lowered in stages from 27% in 2014. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on costs of exploration for oil and gas. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%, but reduced rates apply widely. The top marginal income-tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social-security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of all goods export revenue. Amid pandemic-driven fluctuations in trade and capital flows, the current-account surplus narrowed to a 20-year low in 2020, but bounced back to a double-digit share of GDP in 2021 as oil prices rose and reached a multi-decade high of over 30% in 2022.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Norway is a multiparty parliamentary democracy; minority governments are normally supported by one or more parties in opposition. The constitution is the second oldest in the world after the US and provides for a single legislative chamber (Storting) of 169 members, with elections every four years. Similarly to the other Nordic countries, there is a clear left-right divide among the political parties, and the political system has consolidated into blocs of parties with fairly similar views. As in many countries, the political scene has become gradually more fragmented over the past decade, amid more polarised positions on specific issues such as immigration and the environment. Overall, however, domestic politics in Norway remains more collaborative and tends to produce more stable governments than in many other developed countries. This is in part because parliament does not have the right to call an early election, so spikes in instability do not often result in a change of parliamentary arithmetic. Moreover, the Storting uses a committee system for passing legislation, with an emphasis on building cross-party consensus, and only the most contentious policies lead to a parliamentary vote. Extensive powers are devolved to the 11 counties and 356 municipalities (reduced from 19 and 428 respectively since 2020 following an administrative reform). The parliamentary election in September 2021 saw a rise in support for left-leaning parties after eight years of centre-right governments. The election saw a return of the centre-left bloc to government, in the form of a minority coalition of the Labour Party and the populist-agrarian Centre Party, supported by the Socialist Left Party (SV). We expect the government to remain stable until the next election in 2025.

Political outlook: Political stability The former ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two smaller centrist parties (the Liberals and the Christian Democrats), lost the September 2021 general election and was replaced by a centre-left coalition led by the Labour Party. The Conservatives lost significant support compared with their 2017 result, securing 36 seats (down from 45) out of a total of 169. The party's popularity had ebbed after eight years in power, whereas the Labour Party's emphasis in its election campaign on addressing social inequality resonated with the electorate, particularly following the coronavirus-induced recession. The Labour Party secured 48 seats and leads a minority coalition with the populist-agrarian Centre Party (28 seats). Despite the lack of a working majority, EIU expects political stability to remain firm in the forecast period by international comparison. This reflects Norway's solid track record of cross-party co-operation and consensus-building, as well as the fact that the Labour Party and the Centre Party are fairly well aligned in terms of policy priorities; these are likely to include addressing social inequality through increasing public investment in education and healthcare, as well as streamlining government services. The Centre Party is likely to press for measures to accelerate decentralisation and bolster infrastructure and incomes in rural areas.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Norway boasts a high-quality governance framework, similar to its Nordic peers. With its long tradition of transparent parliamentary democracy, the country's multiparty structure and consensual style of politics have tended to deliver legislation that is typically passed after broad consultation with opposition parties and interest groups. Elections are free and fair, with universal suffrage, and the transfer of power is peaceful and accepted. Corruption is low, the public administration is competent and the legal framework is stable and non-discriminatory. These factors all underpin an effective political system that is characterised by higher levels of public trust and political legitimacy than in most other countries.
We expect Norway to retain its high score for government effectiveness, and the country's robust institutional structures will remain one of its main strengths. The consensus-driven nature of Norwegian politics can at times lead to sluggish progress in the passage of legislation and implementation of reforms relative to some peer countries, but it is a matter of opinion as to whether this is a positive or negative feature.
As European integration has proceeded since 2007, the Storting has taken a more strident role in scrutinising European rules transposed into law as part of Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the context of the UK's exit from the EU, there is support in some sections of parliament for a more distant relationship with Europe, particularly within the FrP. However, we view a substantial revision of Norway's relationship with the EU, either for or against future integration, as unlikely.
There is a large amount of devolved power to regional authorities Policymaking is centred in the capital, Oslo, but implementation is largely left to regional authorities, which decentralises the government's functions. The system works well, with sub-national government comprised of municipalities and counties that have equal rights and responsibilities, regardless of their size. Functions are divided between these regional branches. Municipal government supervises junior education, health and social care, and town planning and infrastructure. County government oversees region-wide development and planning, including roads, public transport and adult education. The growing role of digital administration has contributed to a steady reduction in red tape across all aspects of government, and successive governments have attempted to make central and municipal administrations more efficient. However, disparities persist in digital capabilities among different local governments, with more populous regions, such as Oslo, providing more expansive services than rural regions.
A reform of local government was implemented in January 2020, reducing the number of municipalities from 428 to 356 and the number of counties from 19 to 11. The stated aims of the restructuring were to reduce costs, strengthen local democracy, and improve the quality of local services by giving municipalities more autonomy and greater scope to exploit economies of scale. The reforms destabilise some aspects of regional government and devolve new areas of responsibility, including road networks, broadband development and innovation, to the restructured municipalities. The reform has been met with some strong public and political criticism, especially among more rural and isolated communities, amid fears over reduced local influence and a loss of financial autonomy compared with the previous framework.
Political outlook: Election watch The last general election was held on September 13th 2021. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election before the next poll in September 2025. The political scene is fairly fragmented; in the last election, the Labour Party secured the largest share of the vote (only 26.3%), followed by the Conservatives (20.4%), the Centre Party (13.5%), the far-right Progress Party (FrP; 11.6%) and the Socialist Left Party (7.6%). Before the election, there had been significant focus on two smaller parties, the left-wing Red Party and the environmentalist Green Party; they polled only 4-5% each, but fared much better than in the 2017 election and collectively increased their parliamentary representation to 11 seats, from just two previously.
Voters' preference in opinion polls shifted over the course of 2022, with both coalition partners seeing their polling numbers decline. The Labour Party is polling at 19%, while the Centre Party's support fell to just 6%. The most significant beneficiary of this decline has been the Conservative Party, which has seen its support increase to over 30%. Polling has remained largely stable at these levels in 2023.
Political outlook: International relations EU relations will remain a significant foreign-policy focus. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contributions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24th 2022 has led to most Western economies, including Norway, imposing strict sanctions on Russia on most non-energy goods, while banning firms from engaging with Russian businesses, banks and key individuals. Norway is particularly critical to the EU's stated ambition to move away from Russian oil and gas imports. Russia has been periodically reducing its gas flows to Europe since the invasion, causing the EU to scramble to find alternative sources of gas. As the next-largest exporter of natural gas to the bloc, Norway has come under pressure to increase supply to make up for Russian gas exports to EU countries dependent on the imports. Equinor, the state-owned energy company, has said that it will work to increase production, although significant bottlenecks in the production process will limit the increase. The Baltic Pipe project, a gas pipeline from Norway to Poland and the Baltic states via Denmark, came online in October 2022 and will cover roughly 60% of Poland's historical imports from Russia.
Norway is also typically a net exporter of electricity (much of which is generated by hydropower) to its neighbours, including Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany and the UK (the latter two via high-voltage undersea cables that were only completed in 2021). The cheap cost of domestic hydropower, high regional demand and increased transmission capacity have made increasing exports at the expense of domestic supply attractive. However, the government is under pressure to keep domestic electricity prices low amid the cost-of-living crisis. After droughts depleted reservoirs, the government briefly proposed suspending electricity exports, drawing criticism from the affected countries. Increased rainfall headed off this risk, but in February 2023 the government created a commission to consider ways to protect domestic consumers, including a potential electricity export levy. Changed terms of access to Norway's electricity exports therefore remain a risk to neighbouring countries.
Norway is a NATO member and shares a border with Russia. Its relations with Russia had already deteriorated before the invasion of Ukraine. Norway has accused Russia of orchestrating a cyber-attack on its parliament, particularly targeting the Labour Party. The government responded with a drive to upgrade defence infrastructure in the north of the country. We expect Norway to continue to bolster its defensive capabilities as the war continues. On September 26th-29th 2022 a series of explosions hit the two non-operational Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany, consistent with sabotage. The explosions coincided with the opening of the Baltic Pipe. Although Russia has denied orchestrating the sabotage, it may be a signal that Russia views the Baltic Pipe or other gas pipelines from Norway as potential targets for future sabotage.

Overview: Norway's score in EIU's business environment model rises modestly to eight (out of 10) in the forecast period (2023-27), from 7.9 in 2018-22. The countrys relative status is unchanged, ranking 14th globally (out of 82) and as the eighth most attractive business location in western Europe. We expect slight improvements in infrastructure and in the foreign trade category, with higher scores for the macroeconomic environment and market opportunities partly a reflection of lower volatility after recent exogenous shocks.
Strengths: Norway scores reasonably highly in most categories, reflecting its stable and transparent political and regulatory environments, openness to trade and foreign investment, resilient macroeconomic structures, a low regulatory burden, a skilled labour force, good financing options, and high-quality transport and digital infrastructure. Policy towards foreign investment will remain fairly attractive.
Weaknesses: Less favourable aspects of the business environment mostly relate to Norway's small market size, elevated living and labour costs, restricted access to some product and services markets, skills mismatches and capacity constraints due to worker shortages. Amid cost-of-living pressures and an increased public focus on social inequality and the environment, the left-leaning government is targeting slightly higher taxes on wealth and energy, while easing the labour tax burden on lower-income earners.
What to watch
- Despite a 21% increase in house prices between January 2020 and the peak in mid-2022, and over 90% of new mortgages being variable-rate, house prices have declined only slightly. However, the ongoing monetary tightening and sustained uncertainty may limit consumer spending and raise financial risk.
- Oil and gas prices have fallen from their 2022 levels, but prices remain high relative to historical levels. As a result of the fall, growth in both the offshore and onshore sectors has slowed, reducing private consumption and exports, making a sharp rebound in either exports or household consumption unlikely.

Business environment outlook: Norway's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: State involvement in the economy remains at a higher level than in pre-pandemic period. Some restricted market access amid relatively high level of state ownership. Low regulatory burden for most firms.
2025-27: No significant privatisation expected. State intervention continues to push green and digital goals.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Generally positive stance towards foreign investment, but inflows constrained by tightened investment-screening regime and regional pushback against inflows from China.
2025-27: Ongoing efforts to attract investment in non-oil sectors, such as information and communications technology, business services, life sciences and marine.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Expanded hydrocarbons exports to Europe in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Deteriorating EU-China trade relations likely to hinder (already sluggish) progress towards Norway-China free-trade agreement.
2025-27: Gradual progress on bilateral trade deals via European Free-Trade Association. Changes to European Economic Area membership unlikely. US-China trade tensions become entrenched.

Overview: The macroeconomic environment is robust, bolstered by the fiscal security provided by the vast sovereign wealth fund-the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG)-that invests profits from the oil and gas sector. Diversification of the mainland economy has increased over the past decade, with professional services and technology-focused industries growing, but the country's GDP per head-among the highest in the world-remains dependent on the hydrocarbons and shipping sectors. As the biggest energy exporter in Europe, Norway enjoyed windfall gains from the 2021-22 commodity-price spike, boosting its already substantial fiscal and current-account surpluses.
Strengths: Underpinned by the GPFG, Norway has extremely strong sovereign and external balance sheets. The wealth fund largely shields the public finances from cyclical fluctuations and operates through defined budgetary guidelines, providing flexibility to respond to short-term stimulus demands while contributing to a solid track record of fiscal management. Average income levels are high and unemployment is low.
Weaknesses: The importance of the oil and gas sector to the economy-contributing about half of all goods export revenue-and its high exposure to fluctuations in global demand can lead to volatile trade flows and shifts in the Norwegian krone exchange rate. The insulation of the GPFG (valued at US$1.4trn in August 2023) may hold back structural reform progress, with the mainland economy less diversified than some peer countries. Pressures from worker shortages in a tight labour market, ageing demographics, a leveraged housing market and a fairly complex tax regime constrain competitiveness and productivity.
What to watch
- An aim of the current government to accelerate green initiatives and diversification away from hydrocarbons has been overshadowed by supporting European energy security amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict (and by the benefits of a revenue windfall). Amid climate change, scrutiny of energy policy and the wider role of the hydrocarbons sector is likely to rise over the forecast period. This will include calls to end exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf, but the political consensus is likely to remain to develop rather than discontinue activity, alongside policies to further diversify the mainland economy.
- House-price trends in 2023 have been more resilient than in most regional peers, with the hike in interest rates by Norges Bank (the central bank) contributing to only a slight cooling of the real estate sector. EIU expects the lagged pass-through of tightened financing conditions to dampen prices slightly over 2023-24, but there is a risk that structural imbalances in the real-estate sector and recently loosened lending rules could trigger a more substantial correction.

Overview: Norway offers a fairly attractive environment for private enterprise, supported by a robust institutional structure, limited price controls and low levels of corruption. However, market access is more limited than in most other regional economies, owing to a high level of direct state ownership, including in the energy, telecommunications, transport and banking sectors. State intervention in the economy has increased in recent years (as in most European countries) amid the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. A global drift towards "industrial sovereignty", tighter foreign investment screening rules and a moderate leftward policy shift under the current government (an example being a halt to further competitive tendering of passenger rail services) mean that state involvement will be a more prominent feature of the business environment.
Strengths: Norway has a comparatively low burden of regulation, strong property rights protection, an effective legal system and a generally supportive framework for entrepreneurship. Administrative processes involved in establishing a new business, payment of taxes, cross-border trading and contract enforcement compare favourably with most peer economies. Regulatory barriers in most professional and digital services are generally moderate, with high integration across the Nordic-Baltic region.
Weaknesses: State ownership limits the scope for private enterprise in a range of product and services markets. The broad involvement of Norway's large public sector across the economy at national and local level is a partial constraint on start-up activity. Relatively high barriers to competition persist in insurance, air transport and banking. Enforcement powers of the Norwegian Competition Authority are weaker than in some peer economies.
What to watch
- Some 70 companies are directly state-owned, including the largest energy group, Equinor; the largest telecoms provider, Telenor; the largest financial services institution, DNB; the postal service; and other major businesses in the transport, energy, chemicals, finance, forestry and communications sectors, among others. The eight-year term of the previous centre-right coalition saw limited divestments of state shareholdings, and we expect little privatisation activity under the current Labour-led government.
- An auction system was introduced in 2023 for securing concessions for offshore wind power, similar to that for oil. The government is aiming to complete the first tender process for two areas on the Norwegian continental shelf by end-2023. This will cater for around 3 GW of offshore wind, as a first step in plans to allocate 30 GW by 2040.

Overview: The category score does not change in the forecast period, but Norway sees a relative improvement in its rankings, driven by recent more protectionist policy steps in some countries towards foreign takeovers and external investment in "strategic" sectors. Given its small market size, Norway has long adopted a broadly welcoming approach to inward investment, albeit with access to certain markets inhibited by a relatively high level of state ownership. Mirroring global trends, political and public resistance to foreign influence has risen, but specific restrictions on foreign ownership are fairly limited, applying mainly to parts of strategic industries (maritime and transport) and natural resources. Amid efforts to diversify the mainland economy, focus areas for foreign direct investment (FDI) include green energy, "cleantech" (such as battery production and data centres), marine industries, life sciences and a growing professional services sector. There have been gradual advances, but the hydrocarbons sector remains by far the most appealing to foreign investors.
Strengths: Foreign and domestic investors receive equal treatment in the awarding of licences for exploration and production of oil and gas. Aside from the potential large returns available in the petroleum sector, Norway offers a comparatively stable political and macroeconomic environment, a strong institutional framework, a generally low regulatory burden, high-quality infrastructure, a skilled workforce and established high-value-added industries.
Weaknesses: The constraint posed by Norway's small market size is partly mitigated by its membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), but its geographical location implies comparatively high transport and logistics costs, and limits its attractiveness as an outsourcing base. High labour costs will tend to deter most employee-intensive industries, while fairly extensive direct state ownership does restrict the overall scope of potential FDI activity. Amid a focus on the petroleum sector, a majority of non-oil inward FDI has tended to involve the acquisition of existing Norwegian-based companies, rather than new greenfield investment.
What to watch
- Policymakers have made the development of the "High North" (the areas adjacent to the Arctic) a policy priority in recent years, offering incentives and grants, including a reduction in the scale of employer contributions, with a focus on encouraging stronger growth in the maritime, healthcare and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors there. Nevertheless, the bulk of opportunities for foreign investment will remain in the energy sector, encompassing oil, gas and green energy (such as wind power).
- Tensions over state aid are likely to intensify (within the EU/EEA and outside the bloc) as policy in Europe responds to increased US spending on green industrial policy under its Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which risks diverting investment away from the EU by providing tax credits and subsidies for North America-based production. The issue of region-specific subsidies will be a growing source of EU-US-China friction in 2023-27.
- Amid an increasing global focus on climate change and the environment, public sentiment towards new exploration and investment in the petroleum sector is gradually shifting. In light of the recent fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war, there is unlikely to be any major near-term change in official policy towards fossil-fuel production in Norway, given its revenue-raising importance for the wider economy. A gradual tightening of tax-relief measures and other incentives in the sector is quite possible later in the forecast period, however, slightly reducing its overall attractiveness for new investment.

Overview: An improvement in the category score and rankings in the forecast period reflects our expectation of less volatile trade flows and mild progress in diversifying Norway's export base. Global trading conditions will be challenging, given unstable geopolitics, increasing regionalisation, tighter bilateral controls on technology and worsening West-China relations. Norway has adopted about three-quarters of EU single-market legislation, with notable exceptions around agriculture and the fisheries industry (among the largest in Europe). Trading outside the EU is promoted mainly through free-trade agreements (FTAs) concluded by the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA).
Strengths: Norway's EEA membership means domestic and foreign-owned firms have full access to the EU single market, which accounts for about 60% of exports. Norway's institutions are largely welcoming to foreign trade and bureaucratic barriers to cross-border flows are low. Profits and dividends earned in all sectors may be repatriated, with no restrictions on capital flows.
Weaknesses: Norway's market size and geographical location are logistical constraints and limit its attractiveness as a re-exporting base. The regulatory environment within a complex multi-member trading bloc can at times be more constraining for individual firms than could be the case under a country-specific trade regime. The export sector's high exposure to oil and gas implies often volatile shifts in externally driven demand and prices.
What to watch
- The substantial boost to hydrocarbons export revenue amid the Russia-Ukraine war will bolster near-term investment in the oil and gas sector. Persistent global supply frictions and structurally higher costs of energy, labour and raw materials will hinder efforts to diversify the mainland economy.
- EU-China tensions have risen in recent years as China has come to be viewed more as a systemic rival, with the EU adopting a more forceful stance on human rights abuses, investment screening and efforts to "de-risk" economic ties. Amid US pressure for tighter alignment on trade and investment restrictions relating to China, we expect a deterioration in EU-China ties in 2023-27. Decoupling of trade links will be gradual, given the volume of trade between the two jurisdictions. A likely shift will see firms adopt "China plus one" supply-chain strategies. Negotiations on a bilateral Norway-China FTA have been ongoing since 2008, but any agreement in the forecast period is highly unlikely.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: The tax regime is one of the weaker aspects of the business environment, reflecting its complexity and relatively high marginal rates and indirect taxes. An overall tax/GDP ratio of around 42% is slightly above the EU average, but below that of its Nordic peers. The shares of receipts from income taxes and value-added tax (VAT) are above the regional average, whereas social security contributions and revenue from taxes on property, energy and non-VAT indirect taxes account for a below-average share. Recent tax changes mostly comprise temporary relief measures for households and firms to ease the commodity-price shock, and will largely expire in 2024.
Strengths: The tax regime for companies is generally more favourable than that for individuals-the statutory corporate income-tax rate of 22% is close to the OECD average. Additional rates are levied on offshore petroleum firms (56%) and hydropower production (37%). These have trended higher, but effective rates remain largely stable owing to changes to the tax treatment of losses, depreciation and deductions. A shift to a more cashflow-oriented system aims to improve the system's "neutrality" and improve liquidity for oil-sector firms.
Weaknesses: Following a recent 5-percentage-point increase in employers' social security contributions for high earners, the top marginal income-tax rate is an elevated 56%. The standard VAT rate of 25% is also comparatively high and although reduced rates apply to a wide range of goods and services, these add to the overall complexity of the tax system.
What to watch
- No large-scale tax changes are likely, but the government is targeting a gradual increase in progressivity, via modest tax relief for lower earners, slightly higher taxes on wealth and share dividends, and a tightening of exemptions and "exit tax" rules.
- Temporary revisions to the petroleum tax regime introduced over the pandemic are being amended, including a less favourable "uplift rate" amid the recent energy-price windfall. Phased increases in Norway's relatively high and broad-based carbon tax are likely, as is implementation of further corporate tax-avoidance provisions under the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Other possible changes are a tightening of VAT reductions, a broadening of the scope of withholding taxes, revised tax incentives for oil sector investment and higher taxes on onshore wind and hydropower.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Overview: Financing conditions for business will remain favourable, with Norway retaining elevated global and regional rankings. This reflects the underlying resilience of the banking sector, comparatively modest risk exposure, and a comprehensive regulatory framework. As elsewhere in the Nordic region, there is a preference for bank borrowing among firms, with equity and debt financing limited in scale. Foreign companies have access to the same capital sources as domestic firms, but often work through foreign banks, which tend to have offices in the capital, Oslo, and in cities where the oil industry is based, especially the cities of Bergen and Stavanger on the North Sea coast. Demand for (and supply of) venture capital and private equity has strengthened gradually and this trend will continue.
Strengths: Financial balance sheets appear resilient, and indicators of asset quality are strong. Stress tests prior to the pandemic and since show the banking sector to be more profitable than most regional peers, with solid capital and liquidity buffers and low levels of credit losses and non-performing loans. Exposure risk to the real estate sector is mitigated by fairly robust indicators of debt-servicing capacity and a recent softening of credit growth. Firms' access to finance is considered above average in regional terms.
Weaknesses: Banks are more reliant on wholesale funding than in many peer economies, reflecting limited scope to expand the deposit base. This implies some liquidity risk via exposure to global markets, although long maturities of this funding and diversfied overall funding structures mitigate this risk. Since 2018, major money-laundering scandals involving Nordic-Baltic banking groups have prompted a tightening of previously lax anti-money-laundering legislation across the region, and further measures are expected in line with recommendations from the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force.
What to watch
- Risks to financial instability appear generally low, but a fairly high share of variable-rate mortgages, more leveraged commercial real estate borrowing over recent years and the integrated nature of the Nordic-Baltic banking system imply some vulnerability, against a backdrop of considerably tighter financing conditions (and higher inflation) compared with the past decade. As monetary policy acts with a lag, the full pass-through of the current rate-rise cycle will be felt well into 2024. A large asset-price correction and more strained liquidity conditions could raise bank funding costs and restrict credit availability.
- Macroprudential measures introduced over 2018-22 aimed to strengthen bank capital buffers and tighten rules on consumer credit and higher-risk mortgage lending. Recent house-price inflation has been stronger than in most peer countries, underpinned by structural factors such as generous housing-related tax incentives, rental regulations and limited new housing supply. Further macroprudential measures are likely and could include tighter mortgage regulation limits in the major cities (particularly Oslo) and sectoral risk buffers.

Overview: Norway's score for the labour market in the forecast period remains near the regional average, with a modest decline reflecting structural rigidities and our expectation of a slightly higher occurrence of industrial action. An employment rate of about 75% is above the EU and OECD averages, but trails many regional peers. Policy efforts over the past decade aimed at strengthening work incentives to boost the labour supply and tax base, amid a backdrop of demographic ageing and concerns over future skilled-labour shortages, have had only a limited impact. There is a high level of unionisation and a highly centralised system of collective bargaining between government, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. Public opinion remains broadly supportive of tighter immigration measures, limiting scope for foreign-labour inflows.
Strengths: The labour force is productive and highly educated, with a strong level of technical and language skills. There is a low level of joblessness, high participation of adults in lifelong learning, a well-developed social safety net and strongly established employer-employee relations. Median wage levels are high and earnings inequality fairly low relative to many OECD countries, although regional and sectoral variations have increased since the pandemic.
Weaknesses: A shortage of labour (skilled and unskilled) will constrain activity and efforts to diversify the mainland economy. Two long-standing constraints on labour supply are relatively high levels of participation in a generous disability benefit system and above-average early-retirement take-up. Living costs are among the highest in the world, and housing affordability among younger workers is a growing concern. These factors and the less diversified mainland economy relative to many peer countries contributes to a relative lack of labour mobility, in turn restricting opportunities for development in more remote regions.
What to watch
- The government plans to strengthen workers' rights (by favouring full-time and permanent employment contracts over temporary forms of work), bolster digital skills and incentivise job creation for young and migrant workers, via increased vocational training and a youth guarantee scheme.
- Given labour-supply and demographic issues, there remains a need to bolster labour participation among older workers. An independent commission has proposed pension reforms relating to the retirement age, minimum benefits and disability pensions, but no significant near-term changes are likely.
- Industrial action has been part of the wage-bargaining process in recent years, particularly in the public sector and offshore petroleum industry. Lederne, the trade union for the crude oil industry, staged a series of work stoppages in 2022. The government reserves the right to enforce arbitration in disputes likely to have a major impact on the economy or be detrimental to public health, but the combination of recently elevated energy-sector profits, a tight labour market and heightened cost-of-living pressures imply ongoing risk of industrial action.

Overview: Norway has well-developed transport networks and high-quality digital infrastructure. Gradual improvements to road and rail networks and port facilities are scheduled over the forecast period, based on a rolling ten-year national transport plan (2022-33). This includes new double-track rail lines for two intercity routes (Oslo-Skien and Halden-Lillehammer) and a second light-rail line in Bergen. Good ferry and internal air transport services, including oil-rig links, mitigate the logistical challenges posed by the country's diverse topography and weather-related vulnerabilities, but transport options can be limited in rural areas. Road tolls are an important source (about 10%) of infrastructure funding, although they are politically unpopular. Norway is the global leader in electric-vehicle (EV) adoption, with an extensive charging network. Digital infrastructure is among the most advanced in the world.
Strengths: The land transport network is of good quality and less exposed to issues such as traffic congestion that affect countries with higher population densities. Ports offer important international shipping routes for passengers and cargo, reflecting Norway's global influence in merchant shipping and marine services. High-speed fibre broadband and mobile services are extensive, with rollout of 5G and commercial services comparing favourably at a regional level.
Weaknesses: Norway's remote and rugged geography can imply relatively high logistics costs. Connectivity costs are also above the regional average, reflecting in part the market position held by the part-state-owned incumbent, Telenor.
What to watch
- The strategic importance of the country's offshore rig and pipeline infrastructure has meant that security risk has increased in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. Air and sea patrols of offshore facilities have been stepped up, but vulnerabilities will persist.
- Battery-powered EVs comprised 79% of new car sales in 2022, with conventional hybrids accounting for a further 10%. A government target is for all new passenger cars and light vans to be zero-emission from 2025, with a related objective to reduce transport sector emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2005 levels.
- A Broadband Development Act and targeted state funding to local governments aim to facilitate the development of ultrafast broadband networks and 5G by encouraging co-operation in construction, promoting joint utilisation of existing capacity and developing new regional networks, with the objective of achieving a nationwide gigabit-capable fast-broadband network by 2025.

Overview: Norway scores relatively well for technological readiness, reflecting the scope and quality of its digital infrastructure and a robust framework for research and innovation. Total investment in R&D corresponds to just over 2% of GDP-slightly below an OECD average of 2.4% and well below levels of more than 3% in Denmark and Sweden. Norway ranks as a "strong innovator" in the second-highest group of countries in the European Innovation Scoreboard. According to the Global Cyber-security Index, published by the International Telecommunication Union, Norway ranked 17th globally for its commitment and capacity to deal with cyber-related attacks.
Strengths: The overall quality of Norway's digital connectivity is high. E-commerce and e-business technology, and e-government services are widely used. Internet usage, digital skills levels and cyber-security preparedness are all well above average. There is a good network of public-private research linkages and small and medium-sized enterprise collaboration, and structures supporting research and lifelong learning.
Weaknesses: Despite its comparatively strong research ecosystem, Norway is below average among peer economies in translating innovation capacity into entrepreneurial output. Structural constraints in the labour market will contribute to ongoing challenges over the availability of specialised ICT-skilled workers, partly constraining the pace of digital transformation.
What to watch
- As one of the world's most digitised economies, with tense relations (and a direct border) with Russia, state-sponsored cybercrime and cyber-espionage pose an increasing threat. Cyber-attacks on companies and government ICT infrastructure in Norway in 2021-23 have driven a sharper focus on bolstering cyber-resilience and strengthening collaboration, at the Nordic and EU level.
- Recent budgets have directed funding to the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to strengthen various digital platforms used by the public, including the digital ID portal and Altinn (which offers a broad range of online services such as tax filing and digital mail from public agencies). A major focus of the government's digital strategy is to bolster digital skills levels and expand the available stock of higher-skilled ICT workers.
- In April 2023 the government put forward an eID strategy, aimed at ensuring that all residents in Norway have access to electronic identification for use in the public sector. The government wants to create an alternative for groups such as seniors and children under 15, who have difficulty securing an electronic BankID (Norway's dominant form of electronic identification).

Economic forecast: Policy trends The coalition's long-term policy priorities include long-running efforts to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons, particularly towards fishing, professional services and light manufacturing. The government is also likely to pursue efforts to increase spending on healthcare and education, accelerate progress on green initiatives, and incentivise job creation (particularly in industries affected by skills shortages). However, in the short term the hydrocarbons sector will increase in importance: with the withdrawal of Russian gas, Norway now provides more than 25% of Europe's gas supply.
As a result, the government is likely to focus on reliability of supply in the short term. In the longer term the move towards decarbonisation is likely to exacerbate divisions within the Labour Party between its youth and trade union wings over oil reimbursement allowances (which allow 70% of oil exploration costs to be reimbursed if there is no discovery). This could threaten the tax incentives for investment in offshore oil. The broader role of the oil and gas sector in the Norwegian economy faces growing scrutiny amid climate change, societal shifts, net zero emissions targets, and the gradual diversification of global energy demand away from oil and gas. This could hamper investment growth towards the end of the forecast period and affect exports more significantly beyond the forecast period. However, given the imperative of providing for European energy security, any change is unlikely during this parliamentary term.
Although inflation in Norway peaked at a lower level than in other European countries, owing to its status as an energy producer and net exporter, higher prices are eroding Norwegian growth outside the energy sector. In September 2022 the government unveiled a package of targeted support for households and businesses struggling with higher prices, with further support announced in the May 2023 budget. High profits in the energy sector, along with tight labour markets and increasing cost-of-living concerns, have led to labour unrest, with Lederne, the trade union for the crude oil industry, staging a series of work stoppages in July 2022. The government implemented compulsory arbitration, in effect ending the strike. However, high energy sector profits, tight labour markets and accelerating inflation make labour unrest an ongoing risk.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
General government expenditure 39.4 42.5 43.9 45.2 45.8 46.6
General government revenue 65.5 53.3 53.7 54.5 54.8 55.4
General government budget balance 26.2 10.8 9.8 9.3 9.0 8.8
General government debt 37.5 33.3 29.4 26.4 24.1 22.0
Fiscal conditions are supported by the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the country's US$1trn sovereign wealth fund, which has insulated the public finances from cyclical fluctuations. The fund lost 14% of its value in the first half of 2022 owing to its exposure to equities of major global tech companies such as Meta (US). However, it has partly rebounded from this loss, and remains well capitalised, with a valuation of more than Nkr15.4trn (US$1.4trn) in its 2023 mid-year report. Owing to its long history of fiscal probity, and support from the GPFG, Norway has more fiscal space than most countries, meaning that it remains in a strong position to increase stimulus again in 2023 if high inflation requires increased support to households, without placing any pressure on public debt, which remains low.
The fiscal surplus came to 26.2% of GDP in 2022. Booming hydrocarbons sector revenue more than offset increased social support amid accelerating inflation and higher social spending under the new government. The 2023 budget, released in May, committed to drawing down 3% of the sovereign wealth fund's revenue (Nkr56bn, or US$5.3bn), to cover additional aid to Ukraine and provide support for households suffering from high inflation. Norway typically runs a significant fiscal surplus, of more than 10% of GDP, in periods of high oil prices, and despite the higher level of spending; we expect this to continue in 2023, with the surplus estimated at 10.8% of GDP. A combination of gradually falling oil prices as new global supply comes online and reasonably firm expenditure growth in the second half of the forecast period is likely to erode the surplus gradually, to 8.8% of GDP by 2027.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

10-year government bond yield (av) 3.0 3.4 3.2 2.9 2.7 2.5
Norges Bank (the central bank) began tightening monetary policy in September 2021, lifting the policy rate (which had been at a record low of 0% since May 2020) initially by 25-basis-point increments in early 2022, accelerating to 50-basis-point rises in June, August and September 2022 before slowing back to 25-basis-point rises. Norges Bank has continued its tightening cycle and by August 2023 had raised interest rates to 4%. Persistent high inflation has prompted the central bank to signal that it will continue its tightening cycle deeper into 2023, and we forecast two further rate rises in September and November, with the rate stabilising at 4.5% at end-2023. We do not expect any loosening of monetary policy before late 2024.
Norges Bank's inflation target of close to 2% means that there is some latitude for the central bank to raise rates gradually, even as inflation remains elevated. However, Norway's limited dependence on imported energy means that it will not benefit as significantly from falling energy prices as its European peers.

In full-year 2022 growth reached 3.2%, largely on the strength of the rebound from the covid-19-related lockdowns in 2021, along with robust hydrocarbons export growth. Growth has slowed significantly in 2023, with 0.3% quarterly growth in the first quarter and zero quarterly growth in the second, and we expect full-year growth to reach only 1.4%. Private consumption is depressed by the higher cost of living, business and household uncertainty, and a declining housing market creating a negative "wealth effect". We forecast private consumption growth of only 0.5% in 2023. Investment will grow by just 0.8%, which disproportionately represents offshore investment in oil and gas, with onshore investment stagnating amid higher interest rates and crowding-out by offshore investment. Export growth will slow owing to falling hydrocarbons prices.
We forecast that the economy will rebound in 2024 as the consumer sector and onshore investment recover, with growth in 2024-27 averaging 2%, roughly in line with the pre-pandemic trend. This assumes growth in both the energy and non-oil sectors (with the former slowing across the forecast period as energy prices decline gradually and Europe's energy transition gathers pace). Exports will remain firm, which will help to support a fairly strong medium-term pace of overall growth. In the hydrocarbons sector, a temporary tax break in 2020 that spurred new exploration, resilient sectoral investment and exploration activity during the pandemic will lead to new capacity coming on stream over the forecast period, offsetting reduced output from ageing fields. This revival in offshore activity is likely to raise production to a 15-year high in the second half of the forecast period, although it will remain below the peak reached in the early 2000s. Prices will also gradually fall over the forecast period as new supply comes online globally and industries substitute away from gas where not economical, offsetting the rise in production with reduced revenue.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In common with most advanced economies, the majority of the Norwegian economy consists of services, at 69% in 2022. However, this figure is the fourth highest among the five Nordic countries (with only Sweden at 64% scoring lower), highlighting the importance of natural resource extraction, particularly in the hydrocarbons sector, to the Norwegian economy. Industry accounts for 29% of the economy, with agriculture making up the remaining 2%. Services have generally risen as a share of GDP over recent decades, although they remain below their all-time high of 70% in 2019. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing comprises a fairly modest 7% share of GDP (as compared with 19% for Sweden and 18% for Denmark). The construction sector comprises further 7% of GDP, although it is at risk of declining in 2023 and 2024 as input costs rise and property prices stagnate, supressing new construction.
A 2020 tax credit and surging demand will boost oil production in 2023-27 The oil and gas sector has been the primary driver of economic development since Norwegian oil was first exploited in the 1970s. The influence of the oil and gas sector (as a share of GDP) has declined steadily in recent decades, from about 30% in the early 2000s, amid growth of the services sector, volatile oil prices, disrupted production on major (and in some cases ageing) oil platforms and shifting environmental pressures. After falls in output in 2018-19, oil and gas production rose in 2020 despite the pandemic, supported by a temporary tax break in mid-2020 that encouraged new exploration, and increased further in 2021 and 2022 following rising hydrocarbons prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As at end-2022 a total of 93 fields were producing, up from 83 in 2018, with four new fields beginning production in 2021, one further new field in 2022, and two more in the first half of 2023. Five new fields are currently in development. Early phases of exploration took place in the North Sea (on the country's south-west coast, with 68 platforms currently operating), but later efforts have also concentrated on the Norwegian Sea (on the north-west coast, with 23 platforms) and the Barents Sea (further north, two platforms).
The exploration of new fields is likely to offset declining production in ageing fields (of the 122 fields that have been active, 30 have been shut down), which will raise production to a decade-high level by 2024-25 (although this will remain below the peak in the early 2000s). Official forecasts from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), a government agency, point to continued growth in output to 2024-25, before it tapers off thereafter, with gas output continuing to grow until 2026. This is partly attributable to the reactivation of several oil platforms after maintenance operations, but the main factor behind the jump in production is the Johan Sverdrup field, which came on stream in late 2019. It is the fifth-largest oil discovery ever made in Norwegian waters and will account for 30% of all Norwegian oil production by the mid-2020s, according to the NPD.
The broader role of the oil and gas sector in the Norwegian economy faces growing scrutiny amid greater public and societal commitment to moving towards "net zero" emissions targets and diversifying the economy. Most political parties and the public remain broadly aligned in the view that the focus should be to "develop rather than discontinue" the industry, given the economy's still high dependence on petroleum sector revenue, which has only been reinforced by the energy crisis. However, the longer-term influence of the sector on the Norwegian economy is set to decline gradually from the mid-2020s as the energy transition continues.
Non-oil manufacturing has declined over the past decade Since the exploitation of oil, Norway's manufacturing sector has diminished in economic importance, from an 18% share of GDP in 1970 to about 7% in 2022. Manufacturing is split between an oil-oriented component dominated by machinery, chemicals and ship-building, and a consumer-oriented component, of which the largest is production of food and beverages. The sector is highly capital intensive, with activity having rebounded since mid-2020 more quickly than most services sectors, amid a recovery in global trade and being less exposed to pandemic-related restrictions. Momentum slowed over the first half of 2021, hampered in part by supply-chain disruptions such as the global semiconductor chip shortage and rising freight costs, which have led to a spike in producer price inflation. Investment has since been hampered by rising borrowing costs for firms as monetary policy tightens, and a decline in oil and gas prices stifles the offshore sector. Non-oil manufacturing may receive targeted support in the coming years as part of a broader economic diversification strategy. The link between the krone and global oil prices will, however, continue to pose a challenge to efforts to boost the global share of manufacturing exports.
In the services sector, government and public administration account for the largest share of activity and employment, reflecting in part high-quality and extensive healthcare, education and social welfare structures. Wholesale and retail trade, business services, financial services, real estate, and information and communications technology (ICT) all make a sizeable contribution to services value added. Much of the sector services the internal market, but there are many service industries that have developed a significant advantage compared with their European and global competitors. Given Norway's geographical location and the influence of the oil and gas industry, these tend to be firms specialising in logistics or research and development.
Partnership with the oil sector has enabled transport and maritime services, alongside other professional or technical services (such as engineering, chemicals and research), to develop outside the oil sector. Business services, ICT, and wholesale and retail trade have been among the main growth drivers in recent years, and remained fairly resilient throughout the pandemic. In contrast, activity in contact-intensive services such as hospitality, tourism, entertainment and arts was severely curtailed in 2020 and early 2021, and despite a significant rebound in 2022, are unlikely to regain their pre-pandemic level until 2023. However, the relative importance of these sectors to the Norwegian economy is smaller than in many peer countries, limiting the overall fallout.

Headline inflation peaked at 7.4% in October 2022, and has since gradually slowed, reaching 5.4% in July. Falling energy prices have driven some of the inflation in Norway, but, as Norway is a net energy exporter, this has represented a smaller driver than in most European countries, limiting the speed of the slowdown. Inflation as measured by Norges Bank's preferred measure, which excludes energy prices and taxation, is now higher than headline inflation, at 6.4% in July, down from a record 7% in June, well above the central bank's 2% target rate. This suggests that inflation is increasingly broad-based as energy-related drivers are abating but the still-tight labour market is driving increases. We forecast that inflation will continue to ease gradually amid slow economic growth and a slackening labour market, averaging 2.8% in 2024 and stabilising at 2% in 2025-27.
In contrast to consumer price inflation, Norway's producer price inflation was much higher than in the EU in 2022, reflecting both high energy costs and significant supply bottlenecks in the oil and gas sector as it expands to meet European demand. Producer price inflation averaged 52% in 2022, amid ongoing bottlenecks in the energy sector, but slowed sharply in the final quarter of the year, owing to easing bottlenecks and falling energy prices. We expect producer prices to fall sharply in 2023, leading to a full-year decline of 21.6%, before settling into a growth rate of 2.2% in 2024 and an average rate of 2% thereafter.

Historically, the krone has largely followed the changes in global energy markets, experiencing a substantial devaluation in 2020 before strengthening in 2021 and early 2022 as oil prices rose and economic conditions improved. This was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but has reversed as the initial shock to energy prices has subsided, with the krone gradually weakening as energy prices have fallen. We forecast that this trend will continue in 2023, driven by declining energy prices and interest-rate increases by the European Central Bank. From 2024 the krone will stabilise against the euro. We expect it to strengthen slightly against the US dollar in the forecast period, following the unwinding of a flight to safety among investors in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, as the rapid tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) abates. Further sharp shifts in oil prices from continued shocks to global demand, including the end of China's zero-covid policy and potential further Russian actions in Ukraine, remain a risk to these forecasts.

Norway's current-account surpluses have historically been supported by large inflows on the trade and primary income accounts, reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG, with the size of the surplus strongly correlated to oil prices. Sustained high hydrocarbons export prices (by historical standards) have more than offset a modest deterioration in the income and services balances brought about by the relaxation of international travel restrictions. Norway's current-account surplus reached 30.4% of GDP in 2022 on the back of high oil and gas prices, its highest level in over 30 years. Export earnings will decline sharply in 2023 as gas prices fall but remain elevated by historical standards, with the current-account surplus falling to a still-high 17.1% of GDP. Gradually decreasing commodity prices in the remainder of the forecast period, combined with steady growth in imports, will contribute to a moderation in the size of the current-account surplus, to 12.7% of GDP in 2027.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Norway Stocks and flows Developments in Norway's large oil and gas sector and global energy prices are major determinants of annual inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which tend to be more volatile than in many peer economies. According to data from the IMF, the stock of inward FDI totalled US$271bn at the end of 2021, equivalent to 56% of GDP. Per head, the FDI stock was US$50,060, comparatively high on a regional basis and a similar level to Sweden. There was a rebound in inward investment to US$14bn in 2021 representing the second largest increase in the FDI stock in US dollar terms since 2012. Other substantial swings included a disinvestment of US$19bn in 2016 and a stronger inflow of US$16.3bn in 2019. There was disinvestment of US$4.1bn in 2020, mirroring a global cooling of FDI activity given the elevated uncertainty and restricted mobility posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Origin and distribution Norway's oil-intensive economy means that FDI is largely focused on the oil and gas sector, in addition to ancillary services such as transport, infrastructure and finance. Most of the world's major oil and gas companies are involved in Norwegian oil production, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon (all US-based), BP (UK), RWE (Germany), Engie (France), Eni (Italy) and Shell (UK). According to Statistics Norway, in 2021 the mining and quarrying sector (which includes direct oil and gas extraction), usually the largest sector for international FDI in Norway (and still representing 12% of inward FDI flows in 2021) was surpassed by financial services (17%), and manufacturing (13%), with wholesale and retail trade (9%), and real estate (9%) also representing substantial destinations for FDI. Both manufacturing and financial services have considerable overlap with the oil and gas industry. Based on unadjusted FDI data, Sweden is by some distance the single largest investor in Norway, accounting for 21% of the FDI stock in 2021, ahead of Luxembourg (10%), the Netherlands (10%), Denmark (8%), the UK (7%), and the US (6%). However, Norway is not always the final destination of this inward investment, serving also as a pan-regional distribution hub for third-country investment. As in many countries with established financial services sectors, Norway's FDI data are also partly skewed by inflows associated with "corporate reconfigurations"-changes in complex ownership structures of multinationals-rather than greenfield investment. Based on adjusted data whereby Norway is the "ultimate destination" of FDI, the single largest investor is the US (17% of the FDI stock), followed by Sweden (13%), the UK (8%), Denmark (7%) and Finland (6%).
Determinants Aside from the potential large returns on offer to investors in the oil and gas sector, Norway offers a comparatively stable political and macroeconomic environment, a strong institutional framework, a generally low regulatory burden for firms, high-quality public services and infrastructure, a highly skilled workforce, openness to foreign investment and foreign trade, and established high-value-added industry sectors. The constraint posed by Norway's small market size is partly mitigated by membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives Norwegian firms access to the wider European market. However, its geographical location does imply comparatively high transport and logistics costs, while limiting the country's attractiveness as an outsourcing or re-exporting base. High labour costs (in terms of wages, payroll taxes and fairly restrictive labour regulations) will tend to deter most labour-intensive industries, and scope for private enterprise is still constrained in some product and services markets, reflecting Norway's fairly high level of direct state ownership.
Impact FDI has encouraged the transfer of foreign knowledge to Norway and accelerated the development of the oil and gas sector over recent decades. The oil sector has, in turn, encouraged wider growth in the mainland economy through higher wages, consumer spending, and investment in infrastructure and public services, as well as via ancillary services such as transport and finance. Several of these ancillary services, notably supply and maintenance services, have become internationally competitive, despite the historically strong krone. Moreover, high taxation on developed oil wells has led to a resilient fiscal balance and a vast sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund Global. Employment in the oil and gas sector has trended lower since a 2014 peak, but various estimates suggest that it still accounts (directly or indirectly) for about 150,000-200,000 people, equivalent to approximately 6% of the labour force. It can be argued that a long-standing focus on the oil and gas sector has held back investment in other industries, leaving the Norwegian economy less diversified than some of its peers and playing catch up in key sectors. A majority of non-oil inward FDI has tended to involve the acquisition by overseas interests of existing Norwegian-based companies, rather than establishing new companies or facilities. As in many countries, increased foreign investor interest over recent decades has contributed to imbalances in the real estate market.
Potential Gradual diversification efforts over the forecast period are likely to provide more opportunities for FDI in Norway's growing professional services industry, finance, information and communications technology (ICT) and legal, and in areas such as fintech, "cleantech" and biotechnology. Policymakers have made the development of the "High North" (the areas adjacent to the Arctic) a wider policy priority, offering various incentives and grants, including a reduction in the scale of employer contributions, with a focus on encouraging stronger growth in the maritime, healthcare and ICT sectors there. Nevertheless, the bulk of opportunities for foreign investment will remain in the energy sector, encompassing oil, gas and green energy (such as wind power). Amid an increasing global focus on climate change and the environment, public sentiment towards new exploration and investment in the petroleum sector is gradually shifting. This is unlikely to trigger any dramatic near-term change in official policy towards fossil-fuel production in Norway, given its revenue-raising importance for the wider economy, but could lead to a gradual tightening of tax-relief measures and other incentives in the sector, reducing its overall attractiveness for new investment. Norway's robust political, macroeconomic, financial and institutional structures will remain appealing features for potential investors, as will the quality of the labour force and infrastructure. Set against this are the country's high labour costs, small market size and a comparatively high level of direct state ownership, which is likely to persist in 2023-27.

Population growth has slowed recently, but will remain positive in 2023-27 The population of Norway totalled 5.5m at end-2022, up from 4.9m in 2010 and 4.5m in 2000. Population growth averaged 1.2% per year in 2011-15, but has since moderated, averaging 0.7% per year in 2018-22. This slowdown has mainly been due to reduced net migration, alongside a gradual fall in the "natural increase" (annual births minus deaths). EIU expects population growth over the forecast period (2023-27) to remain stable, as increased immigration following the end of pandemic travel restrictions offsets slightly slowing natural population increase. A gradual ageing of the population, a slowly declining fertility rate and increasing life expectancy will continue.
Annual net migration was fairly stable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, averaging about 12,000 per year. Net inflows increased sharply from 2005 to a peak of 47,000 per year in 2011-12. Since then, net migration has fallen steadily in response to domestic economic conditions, shifting regional migration trends, and hardening public sentiment that has driven a tightening of immigration rules in Norway for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Net migration reached a multi-decade low of 11,331 in 2020, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Net migration rebounded to 19,650 in 2021, still well below its pre-pandemic level of 25,327. Net migration then spiked to 57,939 in 2022, owing to the normalisation of travel following the pandemic disruption, as well as an influx of refugees from Ukraine (Norway accepted over 35,675 refugees in 2022, more than double the previous record achieved in 2016). In 2023 we expect migration levels to normalise to near to the 2014-19 trend, as the one-off factors of the war and the pandemic abate. There were just over 877,000 foreign citizens in Norway in January 2023, equivalent to 16% of the total population. Polish migrants accounted for the largest share, with a population of 107,000, followed by Lithuanians (42,000), Swedes (36,000) and Syrians (36,000).
The fertility rate in Norway edged higher during the 2000s, but has fallen steadily since peaking at 1.98 in 2009, reaching a then historical low of 1.48 in 2020. It rebounded to 1.55 in 2021. However, this represented pandemic-related uncertainty delaying births in 2020, rather than a break in the trend, with the fertility rate reaching a new low of 1.41 in 2022. The downward trend reflects in part a sharp decline in births by women aged 20-30 (the median age at first birth is now 30.2 for mothers and 32.2 for fathers). With life expectancy increasing, the overall population will continue to age gradually over the forecast period. The share of the population aged 67 or over is projected to rise to 19.2% in 2027, from 16.3% in 2015. The share of the working-age (15-66) population peaked at 66% in 2009; and has since gradually declined. The size of the working-age population will continue to increase over the coming years, supported by net migration. However, its share of the total population will continue to decline, falling to 63.3% by 2027.
The demographic challenge is not as severe as in other European countries Norway's population is not ageing as rapidly as in some EU countries, but its upward direction nevertheless implies steadily increasing pressures on the public finances. Reforms aimed at bolstering the sustainability of the pension system via flexible retirement ages (from 62 to 75), adjustments for life expectancy and less generous indexation have been implemented since the early 2000s. Further changes are likely over the forecast period, with a focus on disincentivising early retirement. Healthcare expenditure will continue to rise steadily, along with the median age of the population. Greater fiscal burdens will also be placed on local and municipal government, as the burden of social care for the aged, in the form of live-in helpers or retirement homes, will also steadily increase as the average age of the population rises.
Owing to Norway's unique geography, with a long coastline and separated settlements, rural areas are far more dispersed than in many other European countries, raising the cost of services provision for isolated communities. This is aggravated by an increasingly concentrated population as a whole, with 82.6% of Norway's population living in urban areas in 2022. Areas in the far north of Norway are remote and underpopulated; Finnmark, the northernmost region, has a population of 76,000 dispersed across 48,600 sq km. The cost of maintaining public service provision in rural areas was a driver behind the "municipal reform" implemented by the Conservatives-led government in 2020.

Norway will remain one of the world's wealthiest countries Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, with elevated levels of GDP per head and median household income, and access to the EU single market via membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). Market opportunities are constrained, however, by the comparatively small size of the domestic market, its geographical location and high operating costs. In terms of GDP per head (at market exchange rates), Norway ranked third in the world in 2022, at about US$105,299, behind only Luxembourg and Ireland. Measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), adjusting for different price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates, Norway ranked fifth, also behind Singapore and Qatar. The country's population of 5.5m is among the smallest in western Europe, just above that of Ireland and marginally lower than in Denmark and Finland. In terms of market size, nominal GDP of US$577bn in 2022 was about one-third larger than Denmark and similar in scale to Belgium, accounting for a modest 0.6% of global GDP. Estimates of the distribution of household income (such as the Gini index) point to a comparatively low level of inequality in Norway, reflecting relatively high rates of marginal taxation and redistribution, alongside high levels of trust and co-operation within its society.
Norway's consumer goods market is modest in size, similar to those of Denmark and Portugal and about one-tenth that of the UK. Household consumption per head (at US$34,315 in 2022) is among the highest in western Europe and above all its Nordic peers. Norway's share of private consumption in total GDP is lower than in most west European economies, mainly owing to a large public sector. In 2022 household consumption accounted for 33% of GDP, well below that of the UK (63%), Italy (60%), France (53%), Finland (51%) and Germany (51%), and slightly lower than in Denmark (43%) and Sweden (44%). Real consumption growth averaged 3% per year in 2010-15, moderating to 1.7% per year in 2016-19. The pandemic triggered a slump in consumer spending in 2020, but also a spike in household savings. EIU expects that the savings glut will be exhausted by 2023, with household savings rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Consumer spending is therefore likely to slow markedly in late 2023 owing to higher inflation across Europe (although it will remain positive, unlike in many of Norway's European peer countries). We expect a gradual rebound in 2024-27, with household consumption per head forecast at US$46,020 and GDP per head at US$113,767 at market exchange rates in 2027.

The dominance of the oil sector prevents substantial diversification Most consumer durables markets are relatively open to competition, with many small, medium-sized and niche players competing. As the extent of domestic manufacturing is limited, the bulk of consumer goods are imported. Elevated labour costs are one of the main disadvantages for firms operating in Norway, being among the highest in Europe. Geographically, the country is connected to few of its major export markets (except Sweden) by land, restricting its scope as a major business or commercial hub for the rest of Europe. The dominance of the oil sector, on both skilled labour and the currency, also serves to constrain efforts to diversify the economy into other industries, as has been achieved in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark.

Initial conditions: Aided by its rich endowment of offshore oil and gas, Norway's GDP growth has outperformed that of its European neighbours over the past decade, averaging 1.3% in 2010-20, compared with a euro area average of 0.7%. With only about half of its petroleum reserves extracted to date, the country will retain its pre-eminence in European energy production throughout EIU's long-term forecast period (2023-50). However, pressures on the oil and gas sector will steadily rise as government policy becomes less accommodative and environmental concerns become more prominent in the national debate. Although participation rates in Norway are high, one long-term challenge for the government will be to reverse the trend among older workers to take early retirement. To this effect, the pension system is undergoing more reform, including via a pension adjustment linked to life expectancy, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Technological change has increasingly supported Norwegian growth, with the application of communications and IT becoming more widespread over the past decade, supporting productivity gains. Risk factors are a slowing pace of product market reforms and the overwhelming influence of the oil sector on the economy, limiting diversification and promoting exchange-rate volatility.
Demographic trends: Norway, like many other OECD countries, faces a steadily ageing population, driven by both a socioeconomic trend towards a lower birth rate and a preference for marrying later, which have been evident since the 1960s. However, in the Norwegian case these trends have been slower to materialise, and immigration is higher than in the country's European neighbours, so Norway is in a more favourable position to face the challenges of an ageing population relative to other developed countries. Growth of the total population and the working-age population will remain positive, although the latter will ease from about 1% per year in 2000-20 to about 0.4% in 2041-50. Concurrently, the proportion of those aged 67 years or above, and the old-age dependency ratio (those aged 67 and over relative to those aged 15-66) will increase, leading to greater fiscal pressure on the government, which provides old age services and transfers. Further rises in the participation rate (which is already among the highest in the world) or improvements to worker productivity will be needed to maintain the social safety net.
Even taking into account the flow of oil revenue, pension liabilities will greatly exceed the expected assets of the entire Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund that was created to ensure that future gen-erations would benefit from the country's oil riches). There is concern that current pension reforms do not go far enough in tackling the problems related to work incentives and the generous scale of public-sector pensions. The government will need to take further action over the coming decade to avoid a sharply rising tax burden.
External conditions: As a small country that is highly dependent on open markets and free trade, Norway stands to benefit from its European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which extends the EU's single market to include it. The EU is the world's largest and most integrated regional market, and accounts for the vast majority of Norwegian exports and imports. Set against this, the EU's long-term rate of growth is likely to remain moderate. Another uncertainty in the long term concerns Norway's position with respect to the EU. Within the EU, although some progress will be made in advancing trade in goods and the liberalisation of trade in services, the focus-particularly in the next decade-will be on ensuring that there is no reversal of these policies. Protectionist forces will increase in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, but, as Norway is less well integrated into global supply chains, the impact of this pressure will be less than in other countries. Although effort has gone into improving Norway-China economic relations, we expect collaboration to be confined to specific sectors, such as fish or oil exports, limiting effectiveness.
Institutions and policy trends: Norway has a long democratic history and enjoys stable, democratic and transparent institutions, along with a well-entrenched justice system. Corruption is largely absent from Norwegian political and business life. The prospects for stable growth are enhanced by high levels of benefits and state-funded education, including at tertiary level, which ensures a healthy and well-educated workforce. In the long term, however, the welfare state may not be as well funded as it is currently. Norway favours free enterprise and market competition to a lesser extent than Denmark and Sweden. The state remains a significant player in many sectors, such as telecommunications, banking, energy and the offshore sector, and progress on the government's plan to reduce its stakes in some companies has been slow. Norway also lags neighbouring countries in efforts to promote competition in major product and labour markets, in part because the country's oil riches provide little incentive for policymakers to enact potentially unpopular structural reforms. Similarly, there is a risk that the existence of the GPFG will mask the need for reforms to the social security system. Ongoing pension reforms include incentives to work beyond retirement age, and cut the link between pension payments and wages; these reform efforts are expected to continue in the coming years. However, government projections indicate that the assets of the pension fund will be insufficient to cover the state's liabilities arising from pensions and other demands on the public purse (such as healthcare) in the absence of further reform of both the pension system and the labour market. Measures would have to include further discouragement from taking early retirement or drawing disability benefits (the proportion of the workforce drawing disability benefit in Norway is almost double the average for the OECD). Ensuring the sustainability of Norway's generous welfare state will be an important challenge for future governments.
Long-term performance: Despite more robust population growth than its European peers, we expect Norway's share of global GDP to decline slightly in the long-term forecast period, from 0.6% to 0.4%, as other countries catch up. As Norway has less scope than most other developed economies to raise its labour force participation rate, its long-term economic prospects will depend on a continued high rate of investment, as well as improvements in productivity, which we expect to rise during the forecast period (with annual average growth of 0.8% in 2023-50, up from 0.2% in 2011-20), having been sluggish for much of the past decade. Long-term economic performance will also depend on how successive governments meet the challenge of structural reform. Given regular large surpluses on the general government budget (with the sole exception of 2020 owing to the coronavirus pandemic) it is often easy for policymakers to ignore non-oil budget deficits. A failure to adapt social security and welfare systems to the challenge of population ageing would lead to large fiscal deficits towards the end of the long-term forecast period in 2050, which would necessitate a rising tax burden and dampen growth. This would be exacerbated should oil production fall markedly, making continued investment in exploration important. We expect real GDP growth to average 1.7% in 2023-50.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The majority of Norway's emissions come from the exploitation of the country's oil and gas reserves, with aluminium production also contributing. Domestic energy usage, which is largely met through abundant hydroelectric infrastructure, is not an important contributor to Norway's carbon emissions, unlike in other advanced economies. Norway also has the highest electric-vehicle (EV) penetration by far, with battery-powered EVs representing 87% of new cars registered in 2022, and a full phase-out of petrol-powered cars planned from 2025. The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) has become more strident in its support of environmental concerns over the past few years. In 2016 two new criteria were established by the fund, requiring it to move away from, first, companies with unacceptable greenhouse-gas emissions and, second, companies for which at least 30% of revenue is derived from thermal coal or operations based on thermal coal. In March 2019 the government established a further criterion forcing the fund to divest from upstream firms specialising in oil and gas exploration, although its holdings of generalised energy firms, including all major publicly traded oil producers, have remained. The current government has raised its 2030 emissions reduction target, which now stands at 55% below 1990 levels.
Despite efforts by successive governments to bolster environmental policy, a substantial effort to reduce oil-related activities is unlikely, with further reform only likely to limit the sector's growth, rather than reverse it. Aided by the economic need for further diversification, political pressure is mounting from some smaller parties to curtail the oil sector's development. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis is likely to delay efforts in this area for several years Eventually, EIU expects a gradual erosion of the country's generous tax incentives for oil exploration, and efforts to reduce flaring, leakages and other emissions produced as a by-product of the extraction process rather than an active effort to shrink the sector.
Norway will be relatively sheltered from the impact of climate change. With a small agricultural sector and a mostly urban population, the country is relatively protected from the warming planet. With the majority of economic output concentrated in the area around the capital, Oslo, and the coastal cities of Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim, the protection of urban areas against rising sea levels and weather events will be central to Norway's strategy to mitigate the economic effects of climate change. The high reliance on hydropower for electricity generation also makes it more vulnerable to prolonged drought conditions. The opening up of new areas for oil exploration in the Arctic Circle (as ice cover falls) will be an upside risk to Norwegian growth and should mitigate some costs to output.
Migration and urbanisation Norway has largely adopted an accommodative policy towards migration since the late 1970s, and the migrant population (including those of Norwegian birth, but with two parents born abroad) in 2022 was some 900,000, comprising approximately 17% of the country's total population. Annual net migration was fairly stable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, averaging about 12,000 per year. Net inflows rose sharply from 2005 to a peak of 47,000 per year in 2011-12. The bulk of these migrants came from eastern Europe after the region's transition into the EU. Aside from a spike in 2022 due to an influx of Ukrainian refugees, which we expect to be reversed, net migration largely has fallen steadily since 2012 in response to domestic economic conditions, shifting regional migration trends, hardening public sentiment that has driven a tightening of immigration rules in Norway for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and most recently the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Polish migrants account for the largest share of the total migrant population, followed by Lithuanians and Swedes.
Recent migration has increasingly come from non-European countries such as Syria, Somalia and Eritrea. These migrants have proved more politically contentious, as greater differences in cultural background and socioeconomic status have led to concerns about integration; the far-right Progress Party has included the reduction of non-European migration as part of its policy agenda. However, we expect Norway's collaborative political system to continue to adopt a reasonably accommodative stance on immigration and integration.
Norway's population has become more urbanised as the economy has developed. According to the World Bank, urbanisation rates surpassed 50% in 1960, rising rapidly over the next 20 years to 70.5% in 1980. Since then, the pace of urban growth has been more subdued, with the rate only surpassing 80% in 2013, reaching 82% 2020. Norway remains the most rural of the Scandinavian economies, with urbanisation rates in Sweden and Denmark slightly higher, at 87% and 88% respectively. This is in part due to Norway's large land area and long sea coast, making rural communities more isolated, but also because Norway was historically rural and underdeveloped compared with its Scandinavian peers, and so has further to catch up with its neighbours. The difficulties of paying for high standards of public service provision to an ageing and diminishing population in rural areas are putting pressure on the government to reduce costs. This was the motivation behind the "municipal reform" enacted in 2020, which aggregated municipal and county authorities together to encourage greater economies of scale and information-sharing in local government services.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite its role in fomenting Venezuela's deep socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, EIU expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2023-27 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his control over the country's political institutions, and by his willingness to use repression and electoral fraud to prevent the opposition from making inroads into the political system. The Maduro regime manages internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces. In terms of foreign policy, Venezuela will seek to strengthen its strategic relationships with a small number of important allies-including China, Russia and Iran, as well as some of Latin America's leftist governments-but will otherwise remain geopolitically isolated.

- Our business environment rankings model puts Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations in both the historical period (2018-22) and the forecast period (2023-27). Even though the country's score rises modestly in the forecast period-mainly reflecting improvements in political stability and the macroeconomic environment-Venezuela places last among the 82 countries covered in our rankings, owing to its poor performance in almost all categories. Overall, government policy deters foreign investment through complex regulations, a heavy tax burden and weak commitment to creating a level playing field. Although the Maduro regime has warmed up to private investment (out of necessity rather than conviction), severe US sanctions remain a barrier to economic growth.

- Although the implementation of piecemeal liberalisation measures will help to foster a semblance of macroeconomic stability, the overall business environment will remain dismal. Venezuela's economic recovery from a deep depression that lasted from 2014 until 2020 will be marred by another dip into recession in 2023 and slow growth thereafter. By contrast, mass outward migration, a dearth of private-sector credit, continued US sanctions and weak confidence in the country's legal framework will continue to weigh on the non-oil economy. Weak public confidence in underlying policymaking means that the government will struggle to rid itself of the vestiges of hyperinflation and depression, such as an incomplete process of dollarisation.

- Venezuela's population has declined in recent years, as the political and economic crisis has led to outward migration: more than 7m Venezuelans are estimated to have left since 2014. We forecast that outward migration will continue in the forecast period (albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of the crisis), given persistent goods shortages and the lack of job opportunities. Despite this exodus of millions of working-age Venezuelans, the old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards. However, population ageing will put increasing strain on the heavily indebted social security system, particularly in a context of precarious public finances.

- Venezuela's 2014-20 depression has led to a deep socioeconomic crisis that will severely impair market opportunities: poverty and unemployment have risen sharply, and incomes have collapsed. Acute economic inequality will also limit opportunities in the consumer market. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, extremely challenging political conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

- Assuming that international oil prices remain supportive, we expect Venezuela's recovery to continue over the long-term forecast period (2023-50). Mismanagement and vulnerability to shocks will keep real GDP growth meagre until 2030, at just 2% per year, but we forecast that growth will pick up to 3.6% in 2031-50, based on our assumptions that there will be a change in government and that the country will return to democracy at some point during that period. Capital and labour are likely to be the main contributors to growth (as the skills base and capital stock are gradually rebuilt). However, productivity growth will be disappointing, as structural barriers will prevent the rapid adoption of new technologies.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 were unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet, as his macroeconomic mismanagement-aggravated by wide-ranging US sanctions-has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) granted itself control over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly, which had been under opposition control since December 2015. The ANC was dissolved at end-2020, after the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
Policy issues: Following a deep depression in 2014-20, the most pressing policy issue is the need to curb macroeconomic volatility and promote economic recovery. The monetisation of vast public deficits created an excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Concurrently, mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of almost all foreign-currency inflows into the country) and severe US sanctions on the energy sector that have been in place since 2019 have caused a sharp contraction in oil production. Incremental pro-market reforms, including dollarisation, have brought some stability, enabling the economy to return to growth in 2021-22. However, major macroeconomic and monetary distortions, a lack of confidence in the legal framework and wide-ranging US sanctions continue to limit the extent to which domestic economic policy can drive more robust growth.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 16%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$11.1bn in 2016 (the last year of official data), owing to a long-term decline in oil exports. We estimate that the surplus fell further in 2022, to US$2.1bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República, has been in power since 1999 and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006. The populist-nationalist PSUV was led by Hugo Chávez from 1999 until his death in 2013; since then the party has been led by Nicolás Maduro. While in power the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested authority, initially owing to Mr Chávez's immense popularity, and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and exclude them from state institutions. Mr Maduro is currently serving his second term, which is due to end in January 2025. However, his legitimacy is contested, given that he won re-election in 2018 in polls that were neither free nor fair. In 2019, in the absence of a "constitutionally elected" president, Juan Guaidó, leader of the opposition Plataforma Unitaria (PU) coalition, declared himself interim president as part of a broader effort to delegitimise the regime domestically and internationally. The strategy largely failed, although a number of countries (including the US) still do not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate president. The PU has now divested itself of Mr Guaidó as leader and intends to challenge the Maduro regime in the 2024 presidential election and 2025 legislative election. The PSUV and its allies currently hold a supermajority of 243 seats (out of 277). Alianza Democrática, a coalition that was set up for the 2020 legislative election and includes many of the parties that are in the PU, has just 20 seats.

Political outlook: Political stability Mr Maduro's civic-military regime is likely to retain power throughout EIU's 2023-27 forecast period owing to its strict control over the military, police and paramilitary forces, as well as its unchecked authority over all branches of government and public institutions. Despite its role in fomenting Venezuela's long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, and even though it is hugely unpopular (recent polls suggest put public support for the government at just 15%), the regime is unlikely to face any serious challenge to its rule. This reflects the absence of democratic counterweights, along with an established patronage structure that rewards high-ranking officials and punishes dissent.
The PU is the main opposition force. The PU has shifted away from trying to dislodge the regime by harnessing domestic and external pressure, and is instead pursuing an electoral route. However, winning the next presidential election, in 2024, will be difficult, as the vote is unlikely to be free or fair. The two main opposition front-runners, María Corina Machado and Henrique Capriles, have been barred from holding public office, raising concerns that the regime will incarcerate them if they are nominated. The regime has also instigated violence at opposition campaign events; this is likely to intensify once the presidential race gets fully under way, which will be at some point in 2024 (the election date has not yet been announced). Beyond the presidential race, the regime's control of Venezuela's institutions severely limits the extent to which the PU can make inroads into the political system.
The regime's interference in the electoral process augurs poorly for its negotiations with the opposition over democratic reforms. Talks that took place in Mexico last year have stalled, despite calls from some of Venezuela's regional partners for them to resume. The main impediment is Mr Maduro's refusal to make concessions on holding free and fair elections for as long as the US maintains its economic sanctions on the country. The US administration, led by Joe Biden, provided some sanctions relief in late 2022; a further loosening may incentivise the regime to reciprocate with some concessions of its own, although it is unlikely to give the opposition the kind of space that could threaten its own political dominance. As a result, any accords that come out of negotiations-should they resume-will relate to non-controversial issues such as the complicated legal status of Venezuelan assets abroad (some governments, such as the US and the EU, do not recognise the regime) and humanitarian support (both sides want restrictions on some frozen assets to be lifted so that they can be used to finance aid).
Although there is little chance that the Maduro regime will be removed from power, it will still face numerous economic challenges, stemming largely from the need to revive the economy following the 2014-20 depression. This has forced it to abandon some of its socialist and statist policies in favour of a more market-friendly approach, but that shift has been piecemeal, and some liberalisation measures (such as dollarisation) have been partly rolled back. Corruption among party officials is also prevalent, as are broad patronage networks. Another challenge facing the regime is to establish control over a highly precarious security situation involving powerful "mega gangs" in urban centres, as well as Colombian rebels in border areas. Although these armed groups lack the resources to challenge the regime outright, they will still undermine the enforcement of law and order.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Venezuela will continue to suffer in the 2023-27 forecast period from the weakest political and institutional framework in the region. PSUV rule has engendered low institutional effectiveness and high levels of corruption, largely owing to the centralisation of power in the executive branch. Questions about the credibility of the country's institutions, and about a lack of accountability and transparency, will remain. Extensive corruption and clientelism in the provision of welfare schemes will also limit political and policy effectiveness. Similarly, PDVSA (the state-owned oil company) is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders and will continue to be run by army personnel, rather than by technocrats.
Drug-trafficking will remain a cause for concern, as criminal networks are well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Another worrisome issue is the high rate of violent crime, largely perpetrated by "mega-gangs" in large cities including the capital, Caracas. The homicide rate in 2022 was estimated at 40.4 per 100,000 population, making Venezuela the most violent country in Latin America (excluding the Caribbean). Aside from homicides, high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas have increased concerns about corruption and mismanagement in the police. Crime will remain high in the absence of measures to reduce impunity, boost youth employment and-above all-to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system.
Even in the event of a political transition (not our baseline forecast), there would be little progress on addressing Venezuela's political and institutional shortcomings within our outlook period, as approving numerous structural frameworks and eliminating vested interests would require considerable political capital, which would probably be in short supply. A new government would be constrained on the one hand by public calls to punish corruption in the Maduro administration, and on the other hand by the practical need to preserve at least some of the regime's bureaucratic apparatus, given that the opposition has not been in power for more than two decades. Furthermore, a political transition could exacerbate problems such as violent crime, which is fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement bodies. The issue could be aggravated further by attempts by a future government to disband colectivos (armed pro-PSUV civilian groups), as they would probably continue to operate as armed criminal gangs under a future government.
Political outlook: Election watch The next presidential election is due in 2024, and the next legislative election is in 2025. Polls suggest an overwhelming desire for political change, but prospects for free and fair elections remain remote, in view of the regime's interference in the opposition's candidate selection process. For example, the government recently attracted international condemnation for its move to ban Ms Machado, who has a large lead over her rivals (including Mr Maduro), from holding public office. Another factor working against the opposition is that several of its most popular hopefuls have chosen not to run under the PU ticket, meaning that the anti-Maduro vote is likely to be split. Given these dynamics, we do not expect the opposition to win in 2024, but a strong showing could be an important step towards regaining political influence and momentum during the next term-all the more if public dissatisfaction with the regime rises. Even if Ms Machado wins the PU's primary vote on October 22nd and runs for the presidency (the coalition rejects the ban), there is still a significant risk that the regime will step up its anti-democratic tactics, which may include imprisoning candidates or committing outright electoral fraud.
Political outlook: International relations The Maduro regime will benefit from improved relations with regional left-wing governments and from a less antagonistic US foreign policy stance under Mr Biden than under his predecessor, Donald Trump (2017-21). Venezuela's rapprochement with neighbouring Colombia and Brazil is particularly meaningful given the economic, security and humanitarian linkages that Venezuela has with Colombia and the diplomatic leverage that Brazil can provide. Both countries have recently hosted global summits to encourage negotiations between the regime and the opposition, as well as to push for sanctions relief, although in practice there is little that Latin American governments can do to extract a commitment to greater democracy from the Maduro regime or to encourage the US to lift sanctions. Several regional left-wing governments-notably Argentina, Brazil and Mexico-have also avoided criticising Mr Maduro's anti-democratic actions. Meanwhile, Venezuela will maintain close ties with China, which has been a major source of financing, although lending has softened in recent years, as the Venezuelan government is unlikely to make repayments.
We believe that Mr Maduro's ultimate foreign policy aim of obtaining sanctions relief from the US will remain elusive over the forecast period, despite some modest concessions, such as an agreement in November 2022 to allow Chevron (a US energy company) to resume joint operations with PDVSA and export oil to the US, with payment in the form of debt relief. Some US oil service firms have also been allowed to deal with PDVSA.

Overview: Venezuela is the poorest performer of all 82 countries that EIU covers in its business environment rankings. Although its score rises modestly in the 2023-27 forecast period (mainly owing to improvements in political stability and the macroeconomic environment), a severe economic depression in 2014-20 and a legacy of state interventionism still pose significant operating risks to firms, despite some token liberalisation efforts in recent years. US sanctions also deter investors, particularly in the lucrative oil sector.
Strengths: The Venezuelan regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, has made modest liberalisation efforts in recent years. It has eased currency and price controls, allowed informal dollarisation to expand, and tightened fiscal and monetary policy. These measures played a crucial rule in ending a period of hyperinflation (2017-21), easing goods shortages and restoring a modicum of macroeconomic stability. Although the trajectory of economic policy under Mr Maduro is far from certain, this recent experience of crisis makes it unlikely that liberalisation efforts will be rolled back significantly, given that the regime can capitalise politically on the economic benefits that these efforts have brought.
Weaknesses: Venezuela's poor score reflects political conflict, a dismantling of the legal framework for investors, and a corrupt, poorly managed state-led model that hampers private enterprise and competition. US sanctions, weak respect for contract rights and a dearth of market opportunities limit inbound foreign capital. Physical infrastructure will remain dire and will deteriorate further as the cash-strapped government fails to invest in the transport, water and electricity systems. The labour market will suffer from a loss of skilled labour, given that more than 7m people have left Venezuela since 2014.
What to watch
- US sanctions, which particularly harm the oil sector, are one of the main impediments to economic recovery. The US has insisted that any significant easing of sanctions depends on the regime undertaking democratic reforms and ensuring a free and fair general election in 2024. We do not think that this is likely, and therefore believe that sanctions will remain in place for longer.
- The government keeps monetary policy excessively tight (primarily through high reserve requirements), which means that lack of access to finance is a serious hindrance to businesses that operate in Venezuela. The sovereign has also been in default since 2017, which prevents it from accessing foreign debt markets. This limits the private investments that could otherwise help to improve areas of the business environment such as infrastructure and technology.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: Government relaxes price controls further. Corruption and selective application of regulations are common and undermine free competition.
2025-27: Contract rights remain weak; red tape and ad hoc interventionism pose problems.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: US sanctions continue to impair government efforts to revive foreign investment.
2025-27: Speculative purchases of Venezuelan assets continue. Intellectual property protection and private property rights remain weak.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Government stops enforcing most exchange controls, but access to foreign currency remains limited. US sanctions continue to hamper foreign trade.
2025-27: Government extends tariff exemptions on imports to address continued domestic goods shortages.
Taxes 2023-24: Government explores options to broaden the tax base, but extremely high informality is a constraint.
2025-27: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2023-24: Shallow domestic capital markets mean that only short-term financing is available.
2025-27: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2023-24: Government raises minimum wage before 2024 presidential election, but labour costs remain low by regional and global standards. Emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2025-27: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increased flexibility in hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2023-24: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2025-27: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates.
Technological readiness 2023-24: E-government services remain poor, but private digital services (particularly fintech) expand. Use of cryptocurrency declines following failure of the Petro (the government's own cryptocurrency).
2025-27: Government makes efforts to expand 5G access, but internet and mobile coverage is limited following years of underinvestment. .

Overview: Venezuela has the least attractive macroeconomic environment of all 82 countries that we cover. On a positive note, its underlying score improves in 2023-27, owing to a recovery from a devastating depression in 2014-20 that shaved off more than three-quarters of its GDP. Despite its recovery potential, the economy is marred by significant distortions, mismanagement and US sanctions. This means that the modest average annual growth rate of 1.9% that we forecast for 2023-27 will not be enough to make up for the loss of output during the depression, or to significantly reduce the economy's vulnerability to shocks.
Strengths: The most significant area of improvement in the macroeconomic environment will come in the public finances, as we expect much narrower fiscal deficits. Although the government has not published complete fiscal data since 2011, there is evidence that the fiscal balance has improved in recent years following extremely wide deficits over the past decade. Additionally, we expect a slow but steady improvement in oil production, helped by fairly high global oil prices, even though US sanctions will prevent the energy sector from recovering to pre-crisis and pre-sanctions levels.
Weaknesses: The scale of state interventionism will make it difficult to undo the myriad of distortions across the economy. Keeping depreciation in check has proven challenging; given Venezuela's heavy dependence on imports, this has put significant pressure on consumer prices. The country's vulnerability to shocks was laid bare by an inflationary spike in late 2022 and early 2023 that brought the economy to the brink of hyperinflation again. Even though the government's fiscal consolidation efforts will be positive for stability, they will also prevent it from undertaking necessary public investments to address infrastructure deficiencies, particularly in the energy sector.
What to watch
- The government does not seem inclined to undertake the democratic reforms that would lead to a significant easing of US sanctions (although some piecemeal easing is possible). As such, the oil industry-a critical ingredient in a robust economic recovery-will remain weak.
- The Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) has pursued strict monetary tightening in order to contain inflation. However, this has come at the cost of a highly restrictive 73% reserve requirement on the banking system, which has constrained credit growth. The BCV could come under pressure to loosen this rate, particularly given the need to spur economic growth.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for policy towards private enterprise and competition is still extremely weak, but it rises from a low base, causing the country to jump up four positions in the global ranking and one position in the regional ranking. The improvement in the score primarily reflects the government's piecemeal liberalisation efforts in recent years, in particular with respect to price and currency controls. There has been some informal dollarisation of the economy, although this has been partially rolled back in order to boost demand for the bolívar. Overall, however, excessive state control of the economy will weigh on private-sector activity.
Strengths: The government has recognised the need to attract private investment, which entails fostering a more level playing field between the public and private sectors in the domestic economy. One of the most radical measures has been the re-privatisation of many state-owned assets. This has ranged from partial offers of about 5-10% of a company's equity to full transfers to the private sector. The use of joint ventures, particularly in the energy sector, has also been seen as a form of de facto privatisation. The government is likely to continue to encourage re-privatisations, particularly in the non-oil economy, which it is less concerned about having under full state control.
Weaknesses: The private sector has to contend with challenging operating conditions and the regime's refusal to alter its underlying approach-characterised by bias against free markets, cronyism, and politicised and inefficient institutions. Uncertainty about contract and property rights and the cumbersome burden of government regulation will continue to restrict private businesses' freedom to compete. Given institutional decay in recent years and a significant centralisation of power, improving competition policy (as well as restricting lobbying and addressing corruption) will require a thorough overhaul of regulatory bodies and legal frameworks, which we do not expect to occur in 2023-27.
What to watch
- Recent efforts at re-privatisation and the establishment of joint operations have been targeted largely at government insiders and other figures linked to the regime, allowing these actors to derive rents from activities that were once dominated by the state. The government could step up re-privatisation efforts in order to boost investment at a time of flagging growth.
- State capture of the country's institutions means that regulatory bodies are not independent and will primarily benefit state interests. This adds risks to private investors who face weak protection of their property rights. There is a risk that efforts at liberalisation will be rolled back.

Business environment outlook: Policy towards foreign investment

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for policy towards foreign investment improves in the forecast period, which results in a rise of one position in the global ranking but no change from its last place in the regional ranking. The improvement in the score is due to reduced expropriation risk, given that the government is operating under significant fiscal constraints and has recognised the need for private investment to revive the decimated domestic economy, particularly in the oil sector. Nevertheless there are still considerable legal and regulatory disincentives for foreign investment, such as a 40% limit on foreign ownership in the all-important energy sector.
Strengths: Since 2020 the government has made some efforts to incentivise private (particularly foreign) investment, in recognition that the state alone is in no condition to meet the economy's investment needs. One of the most important moves to this end is an anti-blockade law that includes provisions designed to encourage private-sector investment, including in joint operations with public companies. The legislation also allows such agreements to be fast-tracked without recourse to a public bidding process, and to be classified in order to provide anonymity to foreign investors (allowing them to bypass US sanctions).
Weaknesses: Inconsistent policymaking, a substandard legal framework that gives preference to state interests and US sanctions greatly offset the Maduro government's efforts to attract greater foreign investment. As the government is in default on its external debt obligations, firms will not be able to access investment protection schemes. Moreover, the government has shown reluctance to compensate firms that have been affected by nationalisations in the past. Chinese economic interest in the country has declined in recent years owing to the Venezuelan government's payment difficulties. Another important ally, Russia, has a fairly limited capacity for expanding its investments in Venezuela, owing to the ongoing war with Ukraine.
What to watch
- The World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is currently considering 17 cases involving claims against Venezuela, in addition to 37 cases that have already concluded. Even if rulings go in the firms' favour, Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID in 2012 will make it difficult for them to collect damages.
- The Maduro government has been considering an oil reform bill that would allow foreign firms to control majority stakes in new projects. Although this could encourage new oil-related investments, we think that US sanctions would still prove a strong deterrent, as any company operating in Venezuela would face significant restrictions on their ability to operate in the much more lucrative US market.

Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves just enough for it to rise up the global ranking by three positions, but the country still slips one place regionally. Although the relaxation of capital controls, higher oil export earnings and inflows of workers' remittances from abroad will help to increase the availability of US dollars, supply will still fall short of market demand. Businesses' limited access to hard currency will constrain foreign trade. More generally, trade policy will remain incoherent, and Venezuela will continue to be an unreliable partner, racking up significant debt in unpaid invoices to suppliers owing to the country's financing constraints.
Strengths: Exchange-rate controls were eased in 2018, when a single currency, the bolívar soberano, superseded the previous dual-currency system, which had engendered a large black market for US dollars. Individuals and companies can now buy or sell foreign currency at private and state-run banks, and can use foreign currency for a broader range of daily transactions. It is estimated that the black-market value of the dollar is now only about 5% higher than the official exchange rate. The government has also encouraged the use of the dollar, although it has toned down these efforts since 2022 in order to boost bolívar demand.
Weaknesses: Foreign trade will continue to suffer from US sanctions. Initially targeted at individuals, sanctions have been tightened significantly since 2017 (and even more so since 2019). Restrictions on the energy sector-the country's main source of export revenue-are particularly severe. Venezuela's financial sector has been another main target of sanctions, meaning that the country finds it extremely difficult to obtain financing. For the few companies that the US government has exempted from sanctions, payment is made in the form of oil-for-debt swaps, which limits the export revenue that Venezuela can collect.
What to watch
- In a bid to alleviate domestic goods shortages-resulting in large part from severely diminished domestic productive capacity-more than 3,000 products spanning the gamut of consumer, intermediate and capital goods have been exempt from import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) since August 2021. These temporary exemptions have been extended twice, most recently up to December 31st 2023. They could well be extended again as the government tries to combat flagging growth.
- The government has been attempting to roll back dollarisation to some extent. Although no major new limits on currency transactions have been imposed since May 2022, the government will try to balance dollar use with stimulating bolívar demand. A renewed period of heavy depreciation, however, could prompt new policies to limit dollar demand.

Business environment outlook: Taxes

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for taxes improves slightly in the forecast period, but not by enough to change its poor global and regional performance. Although taxes are not especially onerous and there have been few instances of new or higher taxes being introduced in recent years, the complex and inconsistent tax regime will remain a barrier to investment. In theory, Venezuela offers both foreign and domestic investors a full and equal range of investment incentives, including tax exemptions, special credit financing and export incentives. In practice, however, these do little to encourage investment, owing to other structural impediments.
Strengths: Rates of taxation are moderate and are roughly in line with those in many other Latin American countries. The top personal and corporate income tax rates are set at 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), and VAT is 16%. Capital gains taxes are set at the same level as income taxes. Although changes to the tax regime are common, the introduction of new taxes and major changes to rates are much rarer, which mitigates a certain degree of uncertainty from tax policy. Given the need to stimulate the economy, the government is unlikely to raise the tax burden significantly in 2023-27.
Weaknesses: Tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. The system is also extremely complex. To comply with tax requirements, businesses must make dozens of separate payments each year, which is hugely time-consuming; Venezuela is about three times worse than the Latin American average in terms of both number of payments and time taken to comply. The tax burden is heavy, accounting for 73.3% of profits in 2019, according to the World Bank (the regional average is 46.6%). However, this may be because a small number of firms account for a disproportionately large share of tax intake.
What to watch
- The last official data disclosed by the Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administración Aduanera y Tributaria (Seniat, the tax authority) showed that tax income accounted for just 12% of GDP in 2012. We believe that tax collection may be only half of that now, given the decimation of the formal sector, the sharp increase in domestic poverty and poor tax compliance, all of which will complicate future efforts to boost tax revenue.
- Widespread labour informality and a large underground economy will continue to constrain the government's ability to collect taxes. This will force the tax authorities into a trade-off between enforcing compliance aggressively (which may incentivise informality) or taking a laxer approach (which would reduce intake).

Business environment outlook: Financing

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for this category rises slightly, but financing remains the weakest aspect of the business environment. As such, Venezuela is the second-worst performer globally and the worst in the region. The country's extremely weak score reflects the decimation of bank lending-the product of the authorities' attempts to rein in hyperinflation by pursuing highly restrictive monetary policy. The modest improvement in the score reflects a degree of resilience in the banking sector, which did not face solvency issues during the 2014-20 depression. Nevertheless, Venezuelan corporates will remain shut out of international financial markets throughout the forecast period, as the sovereign is still in default.
Strengths: Venezuela's financing environment has very few strengths, but despite the impact of the 2014-20 depression (and the government's monetary policy response to it), the country broadly avoided a banking crisis similar to those in 1994 and 2009-10, when the government was forced to bail out or take over numerous struggling banks. This resilience is partly due to the large presence of the state in the banking sector (it accounts for nearly two-thirds of assets). Low levels of lending have also helped to avoid a rise in non-performing loans, even in the face of a difficult environment for businesses.
Weaknesses: At 73%, the official reserve requirement for banks underpins a restrictive monetary policy designed to prevent the money supply from spiralling out of control. However, this has severely limited credit to the private sector, which we estimate to be a meagre 0.3% of GDP (from 20% at the end of 2017, which was already low by regional comparison). What little credit banks provide is mostly in the form of directed lending (mostly to agricultural producers and microenterprises) at preferential rates. Fears of a return to hyperinflation will keep reserve requirements remain high in the short term.
What to watch
- Venezuela defaulted on its debt in 2017, which effectively prevented the country from accessing external financing. US sanctions also mean that bondholders are less able to negotiate with the Venezuelan government, which prevents it from restructuring its debt. We do not expect the government to make any significant effort to undertake a broad restructuring and exit default within the forecast period.
- Despite the abysmal financing environment, the Bolsa de Valores de Caracas (BVC, the Caracas stock exchange) has emerged as a source of debt finance for local companies. However, transactions on the BCV must be carried out in bolívares, and companies must submit to regular audits and credit ratings, both of which act as barriers to entry. As such, we expect both the volume of trades and overall market capitalisation (estimated at about 2% of GDP) to remain extremely low.

Business environment outlook: The labour market

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Although the labour market is one of Venezuela's highest-scoring areas, the country still ranks poorly by global and regional standards. The score reflects major skills shortages caused by a mass exodus of Venezuelans in recent years (it is estimated that more than 7m people have left the country since 2014). Many of those who have left are skilled workers who are unlikely to return until the economy is on a much firmer footing (if at all). The informal sector is large and employs the vast majority of the country's workers. Rigid labour laws deter formalisation, although wage regulation is lax and supports the labour market score.
Strengths: Labour costs, particularly for businesses that operate primarily in foreign currency, are low, following a fall in wages during the 2014-20 depression. Likewise, living costs in Venezuela are favourable for workers who earn in foreign currency, which helps to make up for other drawbacks, such as poor services and high levels of urban crime. Despite huge outward migration in recent years, there is still a relatively large pool of people in Venezuela who have spent longer in education than is the case in Brazil, Colombia or Mexico, according to UNESCO estimates.
Weaknesses: The labour market will remain extremely inflexible, which will exacerbate shortages and incentivise informality. Staffing levels (other than for managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements, which typically take the form of extremely generous severance payments that add to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers-a factor that workers and union representatives use to their advantage.
What to watch
- The minimum wage was last raised in March 2022, to US$28 per month, but a sharp inflationary spike that began that year and lasted into early 2023 have significantly eroded workers' purchasing power (consumer prices have risen by a cumulative 563.8% since the minimum-wage rise). Inflationary and fiscal concerns suggest that the government will delay raising the minimum wage for as long as it can; we do not expect it to do so until just before the 2024 presidential election.
- The Maduro government has shown little inclination to address resource shortages at schools and universities, which will not only limit the student intake, but also weigh on the quality of education for the foreseeable future. Educators are grossly underpaid; this contributed to a series of public protests in early 2023, the likes of which could easily re-emerge if the government does not lift wages.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Overview: Venezuela's score for infrastructure remains unchanged; the country remains close to the bottom of the global ranking and is last in Latin America. Venezuela's infrastructure is in a state of disrepair following years of mismanagement and underinvestment. Repeated regime pledges to implement ambitious infrastructure projects have come to nothing, and state-funded investment has dried up entirely in recent years. Failure to carry out even routine maintenance and sustain basic service provision manifests itself most obviously in prolonged power shortages and limited access to running water. Multilateral assistance is unlikely to be forthcoming while the country is in default and US sanctions remain in place.
Strengths: The road network is one of the country's strongest infrastructure assets, accounting for the bulk of passenger and cargo transport. Moreover, paved roads make up one-third of the total (according to the World Bank), which is high by regional comparison. Road quality is highest in the heavily populated north, but many of the more remote regions in the Amazon are only accessible by river or air. The country has adequate port facilities to handle large volumes of crude exports and other cargo. The Maiquetía International Airport in Caracas handles the bulk of the country's air freight, but other regional airports are small and poorly maintained.
Weaknesses: A combination of fiscal constraints and US sanctions means that it is difficult to attract long-term investment into infrastructure projects. Even some of the country's most vital infrastructure assets-such as the 10,235-MW Guri dam (which is the second largest in the continent by reservoir volume and accounts for nearly half of the country's electricity supply)-have fallen into disrepair. This culminated in a 72-hour national blackout in 2019 and has also led to numerous hospital deaths. There is considerable mismanagement and corruption in the awarding of infrastructure contracts.
What to watch
- Reliable access to electricity will be one of the most significant challenges for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2023-27. Some companies have opted to install back-up generators, but this is a costly solution that does not solve all operational problems.
- The country's electricity network remains heavily dependent on the Guri dam. Unless the government makes efforts to improve maintenance, the dam will remain vulnerable, and further blackouts are a significant risk.

Overview: Venezuela's already-weak technological readiness ranking worsens in 2023-27. The dire economic situation has taken a toll on the telecoms sector; a reduction in disposable income helps to explain why mobile-phone penetration, which stood at over 100% in 2013, has fallen to about 66%. Internet penetration has been more stable, at about 60% since 2014, but there are major discrepancies across regions; access in poorer, rural areas is significantly worse than in large cities. The deterioration of the score is mainly due to the decimation of the country's research infrastructure, on top of an already-low level of research and development (R&D) spending
Strengths: Venezuela's private sector has been looking for innovative ways to carve out new market opportunities, paving the way for a recent start-up boom in the country. The initial flurry of start-ups focused on e-commerce, food delivery, real-estate services and social media management. However, start-ups have expanded more recently into fintech, by developing new digital wallets and peer-to-peer transfer systems. The government is seeking to support the start-up boom in the hope that it will spur economic growth. For example, in 2021 it passed an entrepreneurship law that establishes tax exemptions and concessional loans. Nevertheless, start-ups will still face significant structural hurdles as they seek to expand.
Weaknesses: The erosion of purchasing power amid the 2014-20 depression prevents many Venezuelans from accessing tech goods and services. By and large, the expansion of technology in Venezuela is most successful where it fills a gap in existing services; this has been clearest in the relative success of digital finance. There are considerable concerns over online surveillance by the state, including the interception of communications and the blocking of websites that are deemed a threat to national security.
What to watch
- The government launched a cryptocurrency known as the Petro in February 2018. However, the Petro was liquidated in June 2023, following a decline in demand for cryptocurrencies in general and a major corruption scandal involving PDSVA (the state-owned oil company, which managed the cryptocurrency). The decision to liquidate the Petro almost certainly signals that there is no appetite for any other cryptocurrency venture.
- The government is planning to hold a tender for 5G spectrum in 2024 and to phase out legacy systems like 2G by 2025 (most mobile traffic is fairly evenly split between 3G and 4G). This is part of a relatively ambitious national telecoms plan for 2023-25, which also involves an expansion of the fibre-optic network, internet exchange points and data centres.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Policymaking under the current regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, will lack credibility and consistency, and the economic recovery will remain vulnerable to setbacks; indeed, Venezuela fell back into recession in the first half of 2023. The government will make modest progress in boosting oil production, but reviving the non-oil economy will be a much greater challenge. A historic reliance on consumer and capital imports financed by oil revenue had left the country with an extremely weak industrial base, even before the economy began to contract in 2014. Those businesses that have survived the years of capital destruction, brain drain, hyperinflation, limited access to finance and suffocating government regulations since then have had to reduce staffing levels, increase their use of informal practices and, ultimately, contend with weaker profits.
Over the past few years the government has gradually shifted away from its previous statist and interventionist approach by implementing piecemeal economic liberalisation measures. For example, it has dismantled most price and currency controls, allowed informal dollarisation to expand (although there have been efforts to partly reverse this since 2022) and narrowed the fiscal deficit dramatically. It has even sought to privatise some state-owned assets, albeit with little success. As these moves reflect economic necessity rather than policy conviction, EIU does not believe that the government will be willing to undertake the deep economic and institutional reforms needed to overcome the plethora of macroeconomic and monetary distortions still in place, even despite partial liberalisation.

Government debt 291.5 427.8 453.1 417.5 386.0 352.8
Although the authorities have not published fiscal data since 2011, figures on monetary aggregates and private-sector reporting suggest that fiscal policy has tightened sharply in recent years. However, poor economic performance in 2023 will weigh on revenue, causing the fiscal deficit to widen to 4.4% of GDP this year. Much hinges on the performance of the oil sector: the deficit could be wider than we forecast if tepid production increases are insufficient to offset a fall in oil prices (the local Merey mix averaged about US$60/barrel in January-July, compared with US$76/b in 2022). We expect the deficit to narrow to 3.8% in 2024 driven by expenditure retrenchment, which will involve hefty cuts to public works spending, subsidies and current transfers. Widespread business and labour informality will preclude a major improvement in non-oil revenue.
Over the medium term, we expect the government to continue to pare back spending on economic subsidies and federal transfers. However, it will increase spending on other items-including wages, pensions and fixed investment-to prop up the economy and appease voters, especially if political instability rises around the 2024 election. Once again, the pace of fiscal consolidation will hinge on oil revenue. Based on our view that oil prices will weaken gradually towards pre-Ukraine war levels over the medium term, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow only modestly, to 3% of GDP by the end of our 2023-27 forecast period. However, there is a high risk that the deficit will come in wider than we expect, given that the government has a poor track record on fiscal prudence, and that any demand shocks could affect non-oil revenue. Moreover, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain burdensome throughout the forecast period, averaging nearly 300%. US sanctions mean that the regime will have virtually no access to financing other than from the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank).

Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 11.1 21.9 25.9 30.4 30.9 31.5
The BCV will be slow to loosen monetary policy in 2023-27 as it seeks to keep monetary aggregates under control. The BCV's preferred policy instrument is the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which has stood at 73% since January 2022. We assume that the BCV will keep the CRR at this level throughout 2023, before relaxing it gradually as inflation eases. The BCV's overnight interbank rate fell in July-August, to an average of about 75% (from over 100% in recent months), suggesting that liquidity constraints on banks have eased slightly. However, low levels of financialisation and credit mean that monetary policy has limited pass-through effects on the real economy. Transmission from the interbank rate to lending rates will also remain weak as a result of directed lending rules and interest-rate caps. This, along with the extraordinarily high CRR, will stifle private-sector credit, which is unlikely to rise much above its current weak level of barely over 1% of GDP, precluding a faster economic recovery.

The government has not released offical GDP data since 2019, but independent estimates suggest that the economy has fallen back into recession following a 7.6% contraction in the first quarter of 2023 and another 6.3% contraction in the second quarter. An inflationary spiral and currency depreciation in late 2022 and early 2023 appear to have undermined consumer demand and investment more than we had anticipated and cancelled out a rise in oil production in the second quarter. Although inflation and depreciation now appear more contained than they were earlier in the year, conditions for consumers and businesses remain challenging. On that basis, we expect the economy to contract by 0.5% in 2023 and then to expand by a modest 2.5% in 2024.
Oil output reached 810,000 barrels/day in July. This is well above the 2022 figure of 693,000 b/d but still far below the 2013 (pre-depression) level of 2.5m b/d. Capacity constraints mean that PDVSA (the state-owned oil company) would need to bring several new rigs on stream to increase production further; there are now only two active drilling rigs in service, compared with a peak of 70 in 2013. Another factor that is weighing on the oil outlook is the abysmal state of energy infrastructure after years of idleness and poor maintenance. The regime is seeking to resolve these issues and is receiving some technical assistance from Russia and Iran, but progress will be piecemeal given PDVSA's strained finances and its lack of access to capital markets. Although PDVSA's cash flows will benefit from high oil prices, the company will not reap all of the possible gains, as it must still offer discounts to buyers as compensation for sanctions risk. Furthermore, a portion of PDVSA's oil shipments will be used to service outstanding debt and will therefore not generate fresh revenue.
Although there will still be momentum behind the economic recovery going into 2024, election-related instability is a source of significant downside risk to our forecast for 2.5% GDP growth that year. Growth could also come in below that level if oil production fails to pick up as we expect. We then expect economic growth to remain modest in 2025-27, averaging 2.5% in 2025-27. Serious operational problems, inadequate investment and a limited pool of buyers of Venezuelan crude (due to US sanctions) will cause growth in the oil industry to taper off towards 2027. The non-oil economy will strengthen modestly as the benefits of more orthodox policy foster some level of macroeconomic stability, even though the economy will remain highly distorted on the whole. Weak fundamentals, widespread informality and a business environment that is not conducive to risk-taking or long-term planning will limit market opportunities and leave the economy exposed to shocks.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends With proven levels surpassing 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference and crippling US sanctions. The state has exclusive ownership of PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Since 2007 oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%, which has forced foreign companies to establish joint ventures with PDVSA.
According to the latest data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), Venezuelan oil production is in the midst of a modest upswing; production averaged about 800,000 b/d in the second quarter of 2023. This follows several years of sustained declines caused by severe operational constraints at PDVSA that made it increasingly difficult for the firm to maintain production, let alone invest in exploration in order to lift future capacity. PDVSA's problems worsened significantly from 2017 as a result of US sanctions. Restrictions were tightened in 2019, reducing the pool of potential buyers of Venezuelan crude. This has made Venezuela reliant on exporting via third-party intermediaries in order to evade sanctions, at a sharp discount and often leaving PSDVA at risk of fraud from these intermediaries. Sanctions also exacerbate extant operational difficulties by hindering the imports of diluents that are blended with Venezuela's predominantly heavy and extra-heavy oil.
The modest recovery in PDVSA's oil output can be attributed partly to help from Iran and Russia. Most notably, there has been an oil swap agreement between PDVSA and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC, its Iranian counterpart), which has enabled PDVSA to used Iranian condensate to obtain a regular supply of diluents, with which it can then blend its heavy crude. Iranian diluents have provided a vital lifeline for the Orinoco Oil Belt (OOB, Venezuela's largest oil-producing region). In February 2022 the two countries also signed a 20-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), under which Iran agreed to help Venezuela to overhaul and renovate its refining system and gas-processing plants, in addition to providing it with technology transfers and training services. Russia has also invested strongly in its strategic partnership with Venezuela, offering technical assistance to restart oil production and to ensure that its own considerable oil assets in Venezuela are unaffected by US sanctions. On a domestic level, PDVSA has relied on new partnerships with local oil service firms and has outsourced some of its drilling work.
The recent increase in production also reflects a move by the US government in 2022 to allow Chevron (a large US oil firm) to do limited business in Venezuela. Negotiations are under way to allow Eni (Italy) and Repsol (Spain) to resume natural gas production. Despite these positive developments for Venezuela's mainstay energy sector, we believe that PDVSA's plans to lift oil output to 1m b/d by end-2023 are overly optimistic. In theory, PDVSA's cash flows could benefit from current high oil prices (even considering the discount that the company must offer buyers to compensate for sanctions risk). However, PDVSA has been unable to fully capitalise on the tighter oil market because of logistical bottlenecks, and because of the difficulty and high costs involved in bringing dozens of idle oil rigs back on stream. Given the extremely poor state of Venezuela's oil infrastructure, these problems will not be easily remedied. As a result, we do not expect Venezuelan oil production to cross the 1m b/d mark before 2025.
Lifting production more significantly would require huge private investment, prospects for which will remain poor for as long as US sanctions remain in place. These sanctions are tied to commitments for democratic reforms and the holding of free and fair elections in 2024, which we do not expect the regime to entertain. As a result, the regime has pursued unconventional means of boosting private investment in the sector, for example through an anti-blockade law that was passed in 2020 and gives the executive considerable powers to establish confidential new deals with private firms and countries. The Maduro regime has also considered reforming the hydrocarbons law so as to abolish the requirement for PDVSA to have 60% equity in joint ventures, reduce oil royalties and provide exemptions for municipal taxes. However, we are sceptical about prospects for large-scale investments, given the discretionary legal framework, the abysmal state of local infrastructure and the high costs of doing business.

Average consumer prices continued to grow in month-on-month terms in July, with a 6.2% increase-the same rate as in June but well below the recent peak of 42.1% in January. However, with the year-on-year rate at almost 400% in July, and in the absence of commensurate wage increases, consumer purchasing power has suffered grievously. Although there is a high degree of uncertainty attached to the trajectory of the bolívar, we believe that the partial dollarisation of the economy will mitigate the risk of a return to hyperinflation. However, the pace of disinflation will be gradual, reflecting chronic deficit monetisation, supply shortages and real depreciation pressures on the bolívar, which will keep import costs elevated, especially considering the economy's heavy reliance on imports As a result, we expect inflation to remain high, ending 2027 at 51.5%.

Following a period of relative stability in March-April, the bolívar began to depreciate again in May. This trend intensified in August, when the bolívar lost about 10% of its value, ending the month at BsD32.5:US$1. Although this pace of depreciation is much slower than in the months leading up to February (when the currency was losing more than 20% of its value per month), there is still a risk that it will drive up inflation. The BCV has continuously intervened in the currency markets through regular US dollar sales and will step up these interventions if the value of the bolívar slides more sharply. Risks to our benign baseline scenario are high, as the regime's poor economic track record and the structural vulnerabilities of the economy could cause a loss of confidence in the bolívar, particularly if political instability rises.

A poor policy mix, sanctions risk and structural deficiencies will prevent Venezuela from capitalising on firm global oil prices. Gross international reserves have remained stable, at US$9.7bn as at end-August, but this includes a US$5.1bn allocation of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) that the authorities cannot access. Despite a supportive current-account position (buoyed by higher oil export receipts and remittances from abroad), the BCV's errant currency strategy means that reserves will not increase significantly. As such, we expect reserves to stabilise at just over US$10bn (including SDRs) in the second half of the forecast period-barely a quarter of their pre-crisis peak. Nevertheless, given the lack of a credible and consistent policy framework, we cannot discount the risk of tighter controls or an outright currency crisis.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela Stocks and flows According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$21.9bn in 2022, which is less than half of the peak of US$45.6bn in 2006. This decline can be attributed to significant disinvestment as a result of a poor business climate, economic mismanagement and weak investor protections. Investment plunged after Venezuela fell into depression in 2014. However, given the collapse of GDP after that point, the stock of FDI as a share of GDP has actually risen. FDI outflows jumped in 2019, when the country's political crisis was at its peak and US sanctions were tightened significantly. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable but is dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company. After peaking at US$26.5bn in 2013, the stock of outward FDI has begun to decline modestly, reaching US$25.1bn in 2022, according to UNCTAD.
Origin and distribution The energy sector, and oil in particular, has been the main magnet for FDI in Venezuela. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even following changes to the ownership structure of most contracts that forced firms into joint ventures with PDVSA. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). Owing to wide-ranging US sanctions and restricted access to external finance, short-term efforts will focus on courting investment from China, Russia and Iran, although success will be fairly limited.
Determinants Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecoms openings, an uncertain political and policy environment (including threats of nationalisation) and a volatile macroeconomic climate have kept FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, under which PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector and private partners are must pay high taxes and royalties. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt require substantial technical know-how and huge investment to be put to production-an environment where major oil companies would thrive. US sanctions, which have been particularly severe on the energy sector, also impair investment, as companies that deal with PDSVA face significant restrictions in the US. Venezuela's oil sector would be a major draw for FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies and if US sanctions were lifted, but EIU does not consider either of these changes likely over the medium term.
Impact Foreign investment in oil boosted output growth from 2.4m barrels/day in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output that was also caused by poor management at PDVSA. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing and services, resulting in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential Given the scale of economic mismanagement and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and productive capacity, there is huge potential for investment in Venezuela. Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism, and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example leather goods, cocoa and rum). However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns about the government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment, the fragility of the legal framework, and US sanctions. A recovery in investment is unlikely under the current leader, Nicolás Maduro, as exchange-rate distortions and controls on local prices will remain unaddressed. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, and only if the new government were to engage in structural economic reforms.

Mass emigration will continue while the Maduro regime is in power Population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate and large-scale emigration. Annual population growth has been slowing steadily, from 2.6% in the 1980s to 2.1% in the 1990s and 1.6% in 2000-10. EIU estimates that Venezuela's population declined by an annual average of 1.6% in 2018-22 as a result of the country's deep socioeconomic crisis-a product of a depression that lasted from 2014 until 2020. The UN High Commission for Refugees estimates that more than 7m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, and that at least 2m of those reside in neighbouring Colombia. Although the Venezuelan economy returned to growth in 2021, it is a shadow of what it used to be, having contracted by about three-quarters since 2014. Given the dearth of economic opportunities locally, we expect outward migration to persist throughout our 2023-27 forecast period, albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of the crisis. On this basis, we expect the total population to fall to 27.9m by 2027 (from an estimated peak of 31.6m in 2018), with about a quarter of the population aged 14 and under and two-thirds aged 15-64. Population density is low, at 32 people/sq km, according to World Bank estimates from 2020. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with almost 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure and limited job opportunities in the countryside will result in continuing urbanisation in 2023-27.
Official statistics belie the destruction of the labour market Analysis of the labour market is complicated by a lack of credibility in official statistics. Based on official numbers, the labour force participation rate rose from 70% in 2013 to 73% in 2018. However, these data are at odds with official figures for economic activity, which show that real GDP was in a downward spiral from 2014 until 2020. As a result, we believe that labour force participation has broadly kept declining in recent years (to 56% in 2022), as deteriorating economic conditions are likely to have discouraged potential job-seekers from entering the market. We believe that the 2014-20 depression-and the associated large-scale emigration-will have had a pronounced and lasting impact on the size of the workforce. As a result, the labour force participation rate will pick up only marginally over the forecast period on the back of a modest economic recovery, reaching 59% by 2027.
According to the national statistics institute (INE), the unemployment rate fell from 15% in 2010 to 7% in 2018. Although the INE has not produced unemployment statistics since 2018, the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, indicated in January 2023 that unemployment stood at 7.8% (presumably in late 2022). Even accounting for extremely inflexible labour laws, these data seem extremely detached from the country's economic realities. Our own projections put the unemployment rate much higher, at 33.5% in 2022. As macroeconomic conditions stabilise, we expect unemployment to fall more substantially, to 29% by 2027 (still extremely high by regional and global comparison). Moreover, a poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will hamper job quality and make more people dependent on the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for more than half of the country's workers.
Healthcare and education services will remain underfunded The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure and a lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. Equipment is mainly imported or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have been constrained by a lack of US dollars. Mismanagement and rampant corruption also limit the extent to which public spending can improve social outcomes. Other long-standing problems, include a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals (particularly doctors and nurses). Based on these various factors, we expect the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services to remain poor for the foreseeable future.

Venezuela's deep economic depression in 2014-20 caused a sharp decline in living standards, with GDP per head falling by more than four-fifths, from a peak of US$12,921 in 2012 to an estimated US$1,681 in 2020. EIU estimates that GDP per head rose to US$3,440 in 2022, as a result of real currency appreciation and (to a lesser extent) a modest economic rebound. In purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, our estimate of GDP per head is higher, at US$5,676 in 2022, although this is still considerably lower than most large regional economies. We expect a moderate improvement in both GDP per head at market exchange rates and at PPP in the 2023-27 forecast period, even though Venezuela fell back into recession in early 2023. The economy remains highly vulnerable to currency depreciation and inflationary shocks, which are strongly related to one another because of the country's high dependence on imports, particularly of food and consumer goods. Political uncertainty will pose a major risk to the economic outlook in the lead-up to the 2024-25 election cycle (the presidential election is in 2024, followed by a legislative election in 2025).
Poverty rates will remain extremely high despite some recent improvement Apart from weak domestic purchasing power, several factors will constrain market opportunities in 2023-27, including persistently high rates of poverty and income inequality. According to the government, the poverty rate has fallen consistently, from 29.6% in 2004 to just 17.7% in 2021, with extreme poverty at just 4.1% in that year. However, these data contrast starkly with independent measures of multidimensional poverty. According to the Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida (Encovi, an annual survey conducted by three well-regarded local universities), the poverty rate rose from 39.3% in 2014 to 65.2% in 2021, which is consistent with the socioeconomic impact of the country's depression. An economic rebound in 2022 caused poverty to decline noticeably, to a still-high 50.5%, although this belies increased inequality. Based on Encovi figures, Venezuela's Gini index score-a measure of income inequality that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete inequality)-rose from 0.407 in 2014 to 0.603 in 2022. This makes Venezuela one of the most unequal societies on the planet.
A dismal business environment offsets many of the country's advantages Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transitionVenezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location. However, this will not translate into real gains until a more market-friendly administration takes over (not our baseline forecast for 2023-27). The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions and a fairly favourable geographical location (given its proximity to the US). However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and deteriorations in public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, a deterioration in the quality of healthcare and education provision in the past three decades has contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, as has an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

Retail sales volumes will be subdued in 2023-27 As in the rest of Latin America, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure; this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped owing to government controls and the country's severely damaged productive capacity. Moreover, limited availability of foreign exchange has resulted in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically. The weak outlook for economic recovery will subdue retail sales volumes throughout the 2023-27 forecast period.

EIU expects Venezuela's real GDP per head to grow by an annual average of just 2.4% in 2023-30, but the current regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, does not seem inclined to undertake the economic, legal and institutional reforms needed to engender robust and sustainable growth. Our long-term forecast for 2023-50 assumes that successor governments will gradually put forward structural reforms to the oil sector and the business environment. Nevertheless, the country's weak institutions, its dependence on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth. As a result, we forecast that real GDP per head will grow by a modest 2% per year in 2031-50, and that per-head GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) will be just US$17,960 by the end of that period. This will be lower than before the 2014-20 depression-extremely low for a country with Venezuela's endowment of national resources.
The 2014-20 depression will impair productivity in 2023-50 Initial conditions: Under the previous president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), the economy expanded strongly on the back of a global oil price bonanza and aggressive public spending (apart from a slump in 2009-10 caused by the global financial crisis). However, growth decelerated sharply in 2013, leading into a deep depression amid a collapse in oil prices, serious policy mismanagement and inefficiencies stemming from large-scale corruption. We estimate that real GDP contracted by a whopping 78% in 2014-20-the largest recorded collapse for any country not at war. A pivot towards more orthodox macroeconomic policies and the elimination of distortionary controls helped to stabilise the economy in 2021, and the economy returned to growth. Nevertheless, the 2014-20 crisis will have long-lasting effects, many of which will prove extremely hard to reverse. Corruption and cronyism are deeply ingrained in the political culture, and rooting these out will be difficult. The emigration of most skilled labour and underinvestment in human capital will undermine the quality of the labour force for years to come. The infrastructure deficit will also widen, as fiscal constraints will impede public investment.
Demographic trends: As in most other developing countires, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, although the labour force itself will grow more quickly as participation rates rise. Even despite an exodus of young people since 2014, Venezuela will benefit from supportive population dynamics, as the dependency ratio of old to young will remain low by OECD standards. The share of the population aged 65 years and over will only be about 11% in 2050, whereas the share of the population at working age will remain high, at 67%. A particular risk to productivity is brain drain, as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad in recent years and are unlikely to return.
Oil will remain crucial to Venezuela's economic prospects External conditions: We estimate that oil accounts for close to 90% of export revenue. Although there will be a drive to diversify the productive base in the long term, it will be limited, and Venezuela will remain highly dependent on exports of oil and other commodities. We expect Venezuela to develop existing links with China, Russia and Iran; it will not develop links elsewhere until US sanctions are lifted, which we do not expect to happen until later this decade, at the earliest. In the longer term, however, we assume that governments will implement structural economic and political reforms, which will allow Venezuela to diversify away from oil to some degree and will breathe life back into its trade relationship with the US.
Institutions and policy trends: We assume that the Maduro government will take a more pragmatic approach to policy than it did before the 2014-20 depression. This implies that the government will continue its efforts to rein in fiscal imbalances and scale back distortionary controls. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty attached to our outlook, given that the government regards policy efficacy as subordinate to the need to maintain political control. Moreover, even assuming that the government does not reverse course on policy, prospects for improvements in other areas of the business environment are weak, as structural microeconomic reforms will not be forthcoming. Much-needed reforms to the social security system, labour legislation and trade policy will all be left to future administrations. In 2031-50 we assume that an eventual return to democracy will bring policy improvements, but gains will be slow to materialise, given the country's institutional weakness.
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy have been abandoned, Venezuela's GDP growth potential will be constrained by the erosion of the country's skills base and the large-scale capital destruction that has taken place over the last decade. However, there is still scope for recovery: we expect real GDP growth to average 3.4% in 2031-40, before picking up to 3.9% in 2041-50. Higher GDP growth rates are possible in the long term if new, more market-friendly administrations pursue reforms to the country's long-standing economic and political policies. Our forecasts assume that capital and labour will be the main contributors to growth, both recovering from a low base of comparison. However, productivity growth will disappoint, as adoption of new technologies remains challenging. The overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing boom-bust cycles, which will undermine macroeconomic stability and growth and will hamper prospects for catch-up with more developed economies.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, owing both to its geographical limitations and to the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the high concentration of the population along coastal lines on unstable terrains (about 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean Sea). Given poor infrastructure maintenance and little disaster preparedness, population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a recent study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in a rising number of extreme events per year in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded local university, concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration but would also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patterns (which are aggravated by oscillatory climate patterns such as El Niño) may disrupt hydroelectricity generation. This is a major problem, given that hydropower accounts for more than 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infra-structure projects, and minimal attention is given to disaster preparedness. Official data on carbon emissions and pollution in the country are scarce, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialist observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations. EIU has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth; we find that the Venezuelan economy will be almost 5% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century, when the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of the population living in urban centres grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large Latin American countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real-estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spillover from the country's oil wealth, the exodus from rural areas to cities created sprawling shanty-towns across major metropolises, which public-housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, more than 7m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014. Although to some degree this reflects a search for better economic opportunities abroad, some migrants have been driven from Venezuela by political factors and by crime (the country has one of the world's highest murder rates). Anecdotal evidence suggests that most outward migrants are young, well-trained professionals; the loss of these people will do significant damage to the country's long-term economic prospects. Under our baseline assumption that there will not be a political transition in the short term, outward migration will continue (albeit at a slower pace than at the peak of Venezuela's crisis, in 2018-20).
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - After a string of political crises in recent years, EIU expects Italy's political stability outlook to improve. A right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) won a comfortable parliamentary majority at the election in September 2022. Giorgia Meloni, the FdI leader, is the new prime minister. The economic investment plan drafted by the previous national unity government, led by a former president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, has been approved by the EU. This will dominate the legislative agenda in 2023-27, given the vast sums of EU money on offer (about EUR200bn in grants and loans). However, implementation will be patchy, and comprehensive reforms in areas such as taxation, pensions and competition are unlikely.

- EIU expects a small improvement in Italy's business environment score during the forecast period (2023-27). However, the country falls by four places in the global ranking and by one place to second from bottom ahead of just Turkey in western Europe in the regional ranking. Score improvements have resulted in rises in Italy's global rankings for macroeconomic policy, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls. Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, policy towards private enterprise and competition and the labour market. Previous reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact. Despite various past reforms, we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment, and evasion to remain widespread.

- Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU after Germany and France, and the eighth largest globally. GDP per head is below the euro zone average. Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenges include supporting investment and employment, making policies more socially inclusive and putting public debt on a sustainable downward path. The size of the country's public debt and its record of weak government effectiveness will continue to be causes for concern for its core euro zone creditor countries, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector. The ultra-accommodative monetary policy of the ECB in recent years has helped to keep government borrowing costs low and mitigate the financial risks attached to Italy's weak public finances.

- The population grew at an annual average rate of 0.4% in 1999-2015. Since 2016 the population has begun to decline, falling from 60m in 2017 to 59m in 2022, according to the UN's population estimates. We expect the population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 58.1m in 2027, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows. Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) was an estimated 36% in 2022, already the highest in the EU, and is predicted to reach 39% by 2027. This trend, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly.

- Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 55% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

- Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average 1.1% per year in 2023-50 (the long-term forecast period). A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. From 1996 to 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S). Following the 2018 election, M5S and the right-wing Lega formed a government led by Giuseppe Conte, but it was unstable and undermined Italy's relations with the EU. In an agreement to avert a snap election in late 2019, M5S and the pro-European centre-left Partito Democratico formed a new government, also led by Mr Conte. After a government crisis in early 2021, Mario Draghi, an independent and a former European Central Bank president, was appointed prime minister in February, receiving broad support. The Draghi government collapsed eight months before the end of the parliamentary term, in July 2022. A right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia won a comfortable parliamentary majority at the general election in September 2022.
Political structure: Parliament, comprising two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis, the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government.
Policy issues: The economic investment plan drafted by the Draghi government and approved by the EU will dominate the legislative agenda in 2023-27, given the vast sums of EU money on offer (about EUR200bn in grants and loans).
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes, including the regional business tax (IRAP), are levied to fund healthcare services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.9%. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$622bn in 2022, and imports (fob) at US$643bn. In the same year, the current account recorded a deficit of US$27bn, or 1.3% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance After a string of inconclusive elections and political crises in recent years, the September 2022 general election yielded a comfortable parliamentary majority for a right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) and comprising the right-wing Lega and the centre-right Forza Italia (FI). The right-wing bloc won a combined vote share of about 44% but failed to secure two-thirds of the seats, which would have allowed the executive to change the constitution without a referendum, potentially overcoming most checks and balances on power. The FdI obtained about 26% of the vote, up from just 4% at the March 2018 general election. Support for Matteo Salvini's Lega dropped sharply to 8.8%, down from 17.4% in 2018. Silvio Berlusconi's FI secured 8% of the vote, down from 14% in 2018. The centre-left Partito Democratico won 19% of the vote, broadly in line with 2018 (18.8%). The populist Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) won 15% of the vote, down sharply from about 33% in 2018, while the centrist alliance comprising Azione and Italia Viva-a splinter party of the PD formed by a former PD leader and prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in late 2019-secured 7.8% of the vote. In October Italy's new government, the most right-wing since the end of the second world war and led by the country's first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was sworn in before the president, Sergio Mattarella.

Political outlook: Political stability After a string of political crises in recent years, Italy's political stability outlook has improved since a right-wing coalition led by the far-right Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) won a comfortable parliamentary majority at the general election in late September 2022. The current Italian government, the most right-wing since the end of the second world war and led by the country's first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is likely to remain in place for its full term (or most of it) until 2027. However, the government formation process highlighted tensions within the coalition, which comprises two far-right parties-Ms Meloni's FdI and Matteo Salvini's Lega-and the centre-right Forza Italia (FI), previously led by the late Silvio Berlusconi. These tensions could pose risks to government stability over time.
Mr Berlusconi's death in mid-June 2023 should improve political stability in the short term. Mr Berlusconi founded FI himself in the early 1990s, and there is a high risk that popular support for the party will erode without him. Ms Meloni's FdI will benefit from Mr Berlusconi's exit from the political scene, as the vast majority of FI voters are likely to switch to the FdI at the next electoral test, the European Parliament elections in June 2024. A weakened FI will give Ms Meloni's party the upper hand when it comes to decision-making and further shift the balance of power within the ruling collation in favour of the FdI.
Italy's right-wing coalition government has strong populist tendencies, and there is a risk that Ms Meloni's recent turn towards moderate positions will be short-lived. Ms Meloni's reputation for implementing responsible economic policies has been damaged by the government's chaotic attempt to impose a windfall tax on banks' net interest income, which was badly received by financial markets and forced the government to partly backtrack. Ms Meloni had initially projected herself as fiscally responsible by nominating largely uncontroversial figures for key ministerial posts, including Giancarlo Giorgetti, a deputy leader of the Lega with a reputation for facilitating mediation, as finance minister. Nonetheless, the government is likely to avoid major clashes with the European Commission over its fiscal stance, at least in the short term. EIU expects the government to comply with EU conditionality (which is soft by design) in order to unlock the remaining EU recovery funds (a total of EUR191.5bn in grants and loans in 2021-26, or about 9.6% of GDP).
Ms Meloni's government will continue to benefit from the fragmentation of the opposition and the disarray in the largest of these forces, the centre-left Partito Democratico (PD), which has elected a new left-wing leader, Elly Schlein, to carry out a profound rethink of the party's strategy. The Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which performed much better in the September election than most opinion polls had suggested, has struggled in recent local elections and has not been particularly effective in working with other opposition forces to mount a serious challenge to the Meloni government.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Italy has been mostly governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system, all bills must be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. The number of members of parliament was reduced to 400 in the Chamber of Deputies and 200 in the Senate before the 2022 election, but further much-needed institutional reform is unlikely.
Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. Modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to gradually speed up some bureaucratic procedures. However, given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 has been slow. In 2020 the M5S-PD government approved a package of measures (the so-called "simplification decree") aimed at cutting red tape. Attempts by previous governments to reduce bureaucratic procedures have been largely unsuccessful, and Italy still has among the highest levels of red tape in Europe.
A reform of the judicial system should speed up court proceedings in 2023-27 Italy has one of slowest justice systems in the EU: the average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute is more than double that in some other member states. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers, that acts as a disincentive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. Perceived interference or pressure from government and politicians is also a major issue. In August 2021 parliament approved amendments to reform the justice system-one of the main reforms agreed with the EU to unlock EUR200bn in funds. The aims of the reform are to speed up court proceedings, reduce backlogs and implement stricter statutes of limitation for criminal prosecutions. We expect the reform to lead to some improvement in Italy's justice system over the 2023-27 forecast period (albeit from a low base).
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then government action appears to have intensified. The M5S-Lega government passed further anti-corruption legislation at end-2018, imposing harsher criminal penalties and public-office bans for graft, and from 2020 applying the statute of limitations only to first-instance trials so that fewer cases are dismissed owing to a lengthy appeals process. The Draghi government introduced new anti-corruption responsibilities for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which will be in charge of preventing fraud and monitoring conflicts of interest.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury, and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch The next parliamentary election will take place in 2027. Support for political parties in opinion polls has remained broadly stable since the last general election, in September 2022, with the FdI gaining a couple of percentage points at the expense of small centrist parties. A right-wing alliance comprising the far-right parties (the FdI and the Lega) and FI won an absolute majority in parliament in the September election with a combined vote share of about 44%, taking 115 seats out of 200 in the Senate (the upper house) and 237 seats out of 400 in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Ms Meloni's FdI obtained about 26% of the vote, compensating for the poor results of Mr Salvini's Lega and Mr Berlusconi's FI. The Lega's share of the vote was just under 9%, almost half that achieved at the 2018 election, after haemorrhaging votes to the FdI. FI, once the dominant force on the centre-right, obtained about 8% of the vote.
Political outlook: International relations As public opinion in Italy is firmly pro-EU, we believe that the FdI-led government will continue to suppress most of its past Euroscepticism (in the 2018 electoral campaign the FdI advocated renegotiating all EU treaties, including the euro, and the Lega favoured leaving the euro zone). Italy's foreign policy will remain focused on its traditional priorities, namely European and transatlantic co-operation. The government will also maintain Italy's support for Ukraine against Russia. However, all three parties in the right-wing alliance have strong populist tendencies, which are likely to give rise to tensions with Italy's EU partners. Ms Meloni has tried to distance her party from the Lega and FI's past ties with Russia. In 2014 she herself had campaigned to remove EU sanctions against Russia, but we do not expect her to go against EU sanctions in the future.
Besides the Ukraine crisis, there are numerous issues, including immigration and fiscal policy, which could cause relations between the right-wing government and Italy's EU partners to deteriorate sharply. A diplomatic row erupted between Italy and France after Italy initially refused to allow migrants rescued by international charity vessels to disembark at Italian ports in late October 2022. The dispute supports our view that despite Ms Meloni's promises of close co-operation, tensions with Italy's EU partners are likely to reappear, given the strong populist tendencies of her coalition.

Overview: EIU expects a marginal improvement in Italy's business environment score during the forecast period (2023-27). However, the country falls by four places in the global ranking and by one place to second from bottom, ahead of just Turkey in western Europe, in the regional ranking. Score improvements have resulted in rises in Italy's global rankings for the macroeconomic environment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and technological readiness.
Strengths: The improvements reflect the impact of modest economic reforms by successive governments since late 2011 and the implementation by the government of national unity, led by Mario Draghi, of some of the reforms contained in Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), allowing the government to start to access the substantial financial support on offer from the EU.
Weaknesses: However, implementation of the plan will remain challenging as a result of a deterioration in the outlook for economic growth and policymaking owing to the cost-of-living and energy crises, which have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Italy continues to score poorly for government effectiveness, policy towards private enterprise and competition and the labour market. Previous reforms to address the shortcomings of Italy's slow judicial system and reduce corruption have had limited impact.
What to watch
- Despite various past reforms, we expect Italy's tax system to continue to hinder businesses and foreign investment, and evasion to remain widespread, despite past efforts to improve compliance. Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets has made some progress, but the sector remains vulnerable.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: The ruling coalition parties have strong populist tendencies and are instinctively sceptical about measures needed to enhance competition in the economy.
2025-27: Improvement in competition policy is unlikely but ad hoc interventions in sectors that the coalition parties consider politically favourable are possible.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Modest reductions in red tape. Government imposes penalties on foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2025-27: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Pressure on export sector from supply-chain and trade shocks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine moderates.
2025-27: Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China or the US) encourages trade diversification.
Taxes 2023-24: The Meloni government's personal and corporate tax reform plans will be difficult to implement. The government implements a one-off levy on additional bank profits earned in 2023 (0.1% of their assets), with payment due by mid-2024.
2025-27: If implemented, 15% global minimum corporate tax rate to replace "digital tax" on foreign multinational firms.
Financing 2023-24: Monetary policy tightening, with the European Central Bank raising interest rates as support programmes to bolster financial market and corporate liquidity are withdrawn.
2025-27: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign persists. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market 2023-24: "Citizens' income" to be abolished in 2024 and replaced by a new anti-poverty scheme; the dilution of pension reforms is partly reversed.
2025-27: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure 2023-24: Bureaucratic obstacles constrain government plans for higher investment spending. Increased investment in energy infrastructure to boost security and diversification of supply.
2025-27: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness 2023-24: Further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keeps research and development (R&D) spending low.
2025-27: Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Overview: Italy's macroeconomic environment score rises slightly in the forecast period. However, because of falling scores or smaller improvements in other countries, Italy's global ranking has improved. Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenges include supporting investment and employment, making policies more socially inclusive and putting public debt on a sustainable downward path, while addressing the cost-of-living and energy crises. The size of the country's public debt and its record of weak government effectiveness will continue to be causes for concern for its core euro zone creditor countries, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector. The ultra-accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) in recent years has helped to keep government borrowing costs low and mitigate the financial risks attached to Italy's weak public finances. A monetary policy tightening cycle to combat the surge in inflation is under way, causing government bond yields to rise and risk premiums to widen.
Strengths: We expect the ECB to adopt instruments to avoid a further sharp rise in financial fragmentation risk in the euro area, helping to contain the rise in government borrowing costs for heavily indebted countries such as Italy.
Weaknesses: Despite some progress in recent years, economic reforms have generally been introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and implementation has remained an issue.
What to watch
- Measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are planned under Italy's NRRP, but implementation is likely to remain a challenge. The proposed amendments by the government of Giorgia Meloni to the targets contained in the plan have led to a delay in the release of the third tranche of funds, worth EUR19bn, and are likely to delay the release of the fourth tranche, worth a further EUR16bn.

Overview: Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and justice system. Political pressure has generally limited effectiveness of Italy's regulatory bodies. EU directives have generally been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy, transport and professional services.
Strengths: In August 2021 the Draghi government introduced new out-of-court procedures for business restructuring. This should help to accelerate the process, with the courts intervening only in the event of a failure to reach an agreement between the debtor and creditors.
Weaknesses: Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent to foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases were introduced in the previous parliament. However, political opposition and resistance to change remain strong in the judicial system, which is likely to hamper implementation. Implementation is also likely to be an issue without an overhaul of the public administration. As with past reform plans, aspects of the 2022 competition bill faced strong opposition within some political circles and business associations. Following the collapse of the Draghi government, the bill was diluted. Having been delayed several times owing to the pandemic, the implementation of a new bankruptcy code adopted in early 2019 only came into force in part in mid-July 2022, with safeguarding procedures delayed until end-2023.
What to watch
- Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa (CDP)-the state-owned development bank-already has sizeable stakes in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel; Italy's electricity transmission company, Terna; the shipbuilder Fincantieri; and Poste Italiane. We expect CDP's role in the economy to expand further. Since the beginning of 2023 it has been pursuing a deal with Italy's TIM to buy the former state company's fixed line network.
- An agreement reached between the European Commission and the Italian government in 2021 allowed a new company, Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA Airways), to be carved out of Italy's loss-making national carrier, the formerly state-owned Alitalia, after more than four years in administration. In May 2023, however, shortly after Lufthansa took a minority stake in ITA, the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of Ryanair in the state aid cases that the company filed against ITA and Lufthansa. The ruling could hinder Lufthansa's plans to invest in ITA.

Overview: Italy's score and rankings for policy towards foreign investment deteriorate in the forecast period. FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. Hardening sentiment at the EU level towards foreign takeovers and non-EU inward FDI-with a particular focus on inflows from China-has resulted in tighter regional screening provisions since 2017. The economic fallout from the pandemic and the cost-of-living and energy crises is likely to spur greater scrutiny at the EU level, with Italy having extended domestic restrictions on acquisitions to cover banks, insurers, healthcare and energy.
Strengths: The main strength of Italy's business sector has been its many family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies, which specialise in products that require high-quality design and engineering.
Weaknesses: The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to its bureaucratic and legal complexities, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Under past governments, labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and the streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues. However, given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU countries.
What to watch
- In 2019 Italy controversially became the first country in the G7 group of economies to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative-China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. Chinese investors signed 29 separate deals for projects worth a total of EUR2.5bn, including investment in several major Italian ports such as Trieste and Genoa. Fears that Chinese firms could take control of strategic sectors have so far proved to be unfounded, but the Meloni government has indicated that Italy may withdraw from the accord in 2024 when it comes up for renewal, on the back of deteriorating EU-China political relations.
- The overhang from the coronavirus-induced recession and the impact of the Ukraine crisis on international trade and the prices of energy and other commodities will weigh heavily on firms' balance sheets and equity valuations, so there is likely to be renewed foreign interest in acquisitions of Italian companies.

Overview: Italy's score in this category improves in the forecast period, leading to substantial improvements in its global and regional rankings. The improvement reflects our expectation of a moderation of the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis on global trade and supply-chains, to which Italy has been particularly vulnerable. The country's foreign trade regime is largely defined by its EU membership. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU; most non-tariff restrictions have been abolished; and administrative costs related to cross-border trade are low. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). All of these arrangements exclude agriculture. Trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties, with bilateral and regional agreements providing for lower or zero tariffs, as well as co-operation on non tariff barriers.
Strengths: The EU remains committed to the WTO and its dispute arbitration procedures. However, as support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed the EU has shifted its focus towards negotiating bilateral trade deals. In recent years the bloc has signed free-trade agreements with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, upgraded its deal with Mexico, reached a provisional agreement with Mercosur (the South American trading bloc) in 2019, and launched trade negotiations with Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.
Weaknesses: The global trade environment has deteriorated as a result of protectionist sentiment and a moderate slowdown of world trade growth. An as yet unresolved appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body since late 2019 has undermined the effectiveness of the multilateral trade system.
What to watch
- If fully implemented, the provisional EU trade agreement with Mercosur following 20 years of talks would create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people. However, opposition in some EU member states to aspects of the deal (mostly related to agriculture and climate) is likely to disrupt plans for the gradual implementation of the deal, which was due to start from 2021.
- Global trade remains vulnerable to persistent supply bottlenecks, which have been exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis. Many existing geopolitical trends, such as growing US-China frictions, a rise in nationalist anti-globalist policies and the shift in the economic balance of power from west to east, will persist. Recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China or the US) is likely to encourage trade diversification over the medium term.

Overview: Italy's low score for taxation remains unchanged in the forecast period, resulting in falls in the country's global and regional ranking. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, we expect the tax system to remain complex, making compliance costly and time-consuming for private-sector companies. Despite a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017, Italy's standard rate of corporate tax is relatively high, at 24%. In 2020 the government introduced a 3% "digital services tax" on multinational companies. The tax is expected to be replaced by the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed in 2021, but not before 2024. According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue as a share of GDP (including social security contributions) stood at 43.5% in 2022, up from 43.4% in 2021 and 42.7% in 2020. The euro zone average in 2021 (latest available data) was 42.2%, according to Eurostat.
Strengths: Given the extent of tax evasion and avoidance there is plenty of scope in Italy to widen the tax base, close the tax gap (between potential and actual revenue) and shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour. According to Eurostat data, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base for low-wage earners), at 42.9% in 2021 compared with the euro zone average of 37.8%. At 16.9% in 2021, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU.
Weaknesses: In addition to Italy's high corporation tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Company social-security contribution rates are also high by international comparison, at 30% (9.5% for employees). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest rates in Europe), is significantly reduced. The tax system goes through frequent changes. For the 2022 tax year the Draghi government reduced the number of personal income-tax brackets from five to four. The Meloni government plans to cut the number to just three in the short term with a view to eventually extending the flat-tax regime available to the self-employed to employees. The marginal personal income-tax rate has been kept at 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR50,000 (EUR75,000 up to 2021). Tax evasion and avoidance remains widespread in Italy, having been encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, the limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws.
What to watch
- The NRRP contains measures to improve the tax administration, simplify the tax system and reduce evasion, but implementing such reforms will be challenging. We expect the tax burden to remain high owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements.

Overview: Italy's score improves in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation in the banking sector, support recapitalisation and tackle the issue of high NPLs. NPLs have declined considerably in recent years, but are still high, at 2.8% of total credit at the end of the first quarter of 2023. This is well below the peak of 16.9% in 2015, but above the EU average of 1.8%. Much of the decline has been the result of large NPL securitisation operations by a few major Italian banks. Italy's smaller banks have made slower progress. With a view to supporting these banks' efforts to reduce NPLs on their balance sheets, the government introduced a system of guarantees (Garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) in 2016. The scheme expired in July 2022, after several extensions approved by the European Commission. Italy's large number of small and medium-sized firms continue to rely heavily on bank borrowing for financing.
Strengths: The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2023 included eight Italian banks: Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), Banco BPM, Mediobanca, BPER, Iccrea Banca (Istituto Centrale del Credito Cooperativo), and Cassa Centrale Banca-Credito Cooperativo Italiano. Under the adverse scenario, the most severe in recent rounds of testing, Italian banks performed better on average than the EU with a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5% by 2025, a fall of 351 basis points from end-2022. In the EU as a whole the fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 10.4% in 2025, a fall of 459 basis points. MPS, which was the worst performing bank in the bloc in the 2021 stress tests, showed a marked improvement with its fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio falling by 551 basis points to a still-solid 10.1% in 2025.
Weaknesses: Progress towards consolidation in the sector has been slow, but the successful takeover in 2020 of UBI Banca, Italy's sixth-largest bank, by Intesa Sanpaolo, the second largest, suggests that a new wave of bank mergers and acquisitions is likely during the forecast period. However, government efforts to encourage one of Italy's main banks to take over its stake in MPS have so far been unsuccessful. Having rescued MPS, Italy's fifth-largest bank at the time, at a cost of EUR5.4bn in late 2016 when it came close to collapse, the Italian state has injected further capital, while the bank's new management implements a fresh restructuring plan before trying again to sell the bank.
What to watch
- The resilience of the financial sector will be tested by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, followed by the cost-of-living and energy crises and the Russia-Ukraine war. An array of policy support by the ECB, as well as domestic stimulus measures by the government and the Bank of Italy (the central bank), has helped to bolster liquidity and hold down banks' funding costs. However, a renewed increase in loan losses amid higher unemployment and business failures and bouts of global financial market volatility could put pressure on individual lenders' balance sheets, potentially exposing areas of weakness and curbing lending as the economy recovers. Lenders could benefit from higher interest rates as a result of the ECB's monetary policy tightening.

Overview: Italy's global ranking deteriorates by 11 places in the forecast period, as we expect the country to continue to perform poorly in the labour market category, especially compared with its EU peers. In May 2023 the Italian government approved a decree law including measures to increase labour market flexibility with a moderate easing of restrictions on fixed-term contracts; reduce labour taxes; improve active labour policies; and change social-welfare benefits to incentivise people who are out of work to seek employment. However, the measures are limited so are unlikely to have any lasting positive impact on Italy's labour market performance.
Strengths: Labour market reform is a major component of Italy's NRRP. However, rather than focus on contracts, as past reforms have largely done, it will seek to improve job activation schemes, as well as the retraining and up-skilling of workers, increasing the effectiveness of the national employment agency and improving education outcomes.
Weaknesses: The shortcomings that persist in the Italian labour market leave it particularly vulnerable to severe economic and social disruption in the event of another economic downturn. Italy's headline jobless rate was relatively high even before the coronavirus pandemic hit. At 9.9% in 2019, the unemployment rate was well above the euro area average of 7.6%. Government support helped to limit the damage inflicted by the pandemic, but at 7.6% in May 2023 unemployment was still well above the euro area average of 6.5%, and youth unemployment remained high at 21.7%, the third highest in the euro area, where the average rate was 13.9%. Italian labour market participation also remains low, particularly among women and young people, and fell sharply during the pandemic. Italy's employment rate was 60.9% in the first quarter of 2023, above its pre-pandemic average of 59% in 2019 but well below the euro area average of 69.5%. The female employment rate averaged 52.3% in Italy (65% in the euro area).
What to watch
- We expect sectoral wage bargaining between unions and employers' associations at a national level to continue to determine wage levels and employment conditions. Negotiations can be protracted, however, resulting in many contracts expiring well before they can be renewed, contributing to industrial unrest. The social partners agreed in 2018 to implement second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains, but progress in this area was halted during the pandemic and such plans will face resistance.

Overview: As reflected in Italy's relatively low score in this category and its decline in the global and regional rankings, the quality of its infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment over the past 25-30 years, and corruption investigations and opposition from local interest groups have been a relatively common reason for blocking or delaying several major projects. Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in the transport and energy sectors, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.
Strengths: Backed by EU recovery funds, Italy's NRRP focuses on a wide range of infrastructure investments in areas such as sustainable energy and transport, as well as in the digital economy, including the deployment of ultra-fast broadband, and 5G and satellite technology. It remains to be seen how effective implementation and monitoring of the investments will be during the forecast period. The collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in 2018 highlighted the urgent need for maintenance of existing infrastructure. However, the reconstruction of the bridge in record time (it reopened in July 2020) highlights that when there is political will to overcome bureaucratic obstacles there is ample scope for improvement in Italy's performance.
Weaknesses: Successive governments have promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt-servicing costs, combined with competing demands within coalition governments, have made a radical change in policy direction difficult. Limited domestic energy sources, popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation and the Ukraine crisis will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution will also keep upward pressure on costs in the medium term. Investment projects in the sector are also likely to continue to face strong local resistance.
What to watch
- Building a high-speed broadband network across the country has been a policy priority of successive Italian governments. Progress has been extremely slow so far, but the NRRP's focus on the need to accelerate Italy's digital transition may provide some much-needed momentum. Central to the government's plan has been Open Fiber, a wholesale broadband operator that is jointly owned by Enel and CDP. At end-May 2022 Open Fiber and Telecom Italia signed a preliminary agreement to merge their network assets. The merger could help to accelerate the high-speed broadband rollout and avoid unnecessary duplication. But the talks between the two companies have been fractious, and there is concern that a merger will stifle competition.

Overview: Italy's technological readiness score and rankings improve in the forecast period, partly driven by measures contained in the NRRP, including digitalisation of public services. During the pandemic growth in e-commerce accelerated (to 34.8% year on year in value terms in 2020, moderating to 13.3% in 2021 and 3.6% in 2022, according to Istat). However, this was from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales in 2019 (compared with about 20% in the UK). According to the European Patent Office, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy declined by about 1% in 2021-compared with an annual average increase of 0.5% in Europe as a whole-and accounted for only 5.8% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at 82.5 per million population, ranking Italy 18th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany, and France but almost on a par with the UK and well ahead of Spain.
Strengths: Mobile-phone penetration is among the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive.
Weaknesses: Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D), has risen gradually since the beginning of the 2000s but is low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. Total R&D spending was the equivalent of 1.5% of GDP in 2021 (compared with an OECD average of 2.5%), according to the OECD. Italy ranks as a "moderate innovator" in the European Innovation Scoreboard 2023. Its performance relative to the EU has improved since 2016, but its score declined sharply in 2023.
What to watch
- We expect a slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Italy's national recovery and resilience plan (NRRP), drafted by the previous government, will remain its main economic policy anchor, given the vast sums of money on offer (about EUR200bn in grants and loans) from the EU recovery fund. The implementation of structural reforms and investment plans agreed with the EU will remain patchy but sufficient to continue receiving recovery fund disbursements. Comprehensive reforms in areas that are crucial to addressing the country's structural weaknesses and enhancing its growth potential-such as taxation, reducing inequalities, pensions and competition-are unlikely.
In terms of taxation, the Meloni government scrapped the government of Mario Draghi's plan to reform Italy's tax system to make it more equitable and less prone to evasion. Instead, the 2023 budget included a broadening of the flat tax regime for the self-employed, one of several of the right's long-standing policy preferences. In late March the Meloni government approved a bill to reform Italy's tax system over the next two years. Proposed measures include a reduction in the number of personal income-tax rates, initially from four to three, with the objective over the medium term to move to a single flat rate; a reduction in the corporation tax rate, currently 24%, for companies that invest and create employment; the gradual elimination of the unpopular regional business tax; streamlining of the system of tax-deductible expenses; and lower value-added tax (VAT) rates on essential goods. In early August the government decided to impose a tax on the extra profits earned by banks from higher lending rates. However, the clumsy manner in which the Meloni government announced the tax led to volatility on financial markets. The measure, which was not considered in the 2023 budget, in effect imposes a retroactive tax on bank profits in the first half of 2023. The subsequent decision to cap the tax has also diminished the potential revenue to be raised, from a reported EUR4bn to about EUR2bn.
With regard to pensions, the Meloni government chose not to address the structural flaws in the pension system but decided to tinker with the eligibility criteria by introducing the so-called quota 103 (62 years of age with 41 years of contributions, compared with the statutory minimum pension age of 67 with at least 20 years of contributions) in order to ensure flexibility for those seeking to retire early. A shrinking population, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending is already among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP, despite repeated reforms since the early 1990s.
We do not expect an overall improvement in competition policy or policies designed to boost innovation. Ad hoc interventions are more likely, especially in sectors or employment categories that the coalition parties consider politically favourable. With its strong right-wing populist tendencies, the government is instinctively wary of liberalisation and reforms aimed at creating a level playing field among businesses, encouraging innovation or boosting productivity.

We expect the budget deficit to narrow in 2023, both in nominal terms and as a share of GDP, while remaining wide, at 4.8% of GDP (above the government's target of 4.5%). The Meloni government earmarked EUR20.5bn (1.1% of GDP) to support households and firms to cope with high inflation in the 2023 budget, taking the total cost of cost-of-living crisis support to about EUR99bn in 2021-23, or 5.6% of GDP. The 2023 budget also contains a range of other measures that are intended to benefit businesses, low-income salaried workers and families. Some of these measures, such as an increase in the flat tax ceiling to EUR85,000 and an increase in 2022 in the limit on cash transactions from EUR2,000 to EUR5,000, will have a negative impact on tax compliance and tax evasion-which is among the highest in the EU, at about EUR100bn per year. This will weigh on revenue collection in the coming years.
We forecast that the budget deficit will narrow to 2.8% of GDP in 2027. The public debt/GDP ratio-which at 144.3% in 2022 is the second highest in the euro zone after Greece-will fall only modestly over our forecast period (2023-27), to about 140% of GDP in 2027. Over the medium term, the government's fiscal stance is less clear, and the risk of a rift between Italy and the EU over fiscal policy will grow. With large fiscal deficits and rising funding costs, there is a moderate risk that investors will lose faith in Italy's fiscal sustainability, triggering a sell-off in sovereign bond markets. This should deter the government from pursuing reckless fiscal policies, at least until the start of monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) and a decline in borrowing costs from mid-2024.

Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

At its most recent monetary policy meeting on July 27th the ECB raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the cumulative increase in policy rates since July 2022 to 425 basis points, as it expects euro zone inflation to remain above its 2% target until 2025. Headline inflation eased from 5.5% in June to 5.3% in July, but underlying price pressures remained stubbornly high. The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, committed to following a "data-dependent approach" and raised the possibility of a pause at the September meeting if forthcoming data show that inflation is declining more significantly. We believe that the ECB will pause its tightening cycle in September, with the deposit rate settling at 3.75% and the main refinancing rate at 4.25% until mid-2024-a 23-year high. However, there is a very high risk that the bank will continue to tighten monetary policy if inflation proves stickier than expected. On the assumption that annual inflation slows more significantly next year, we expect the ECB to start easing monetary policy from the second half of 2024, with the main refinancing rate settling at about 1.75% in 2026-27.
Households and businesses will continue to face a sharp rise in borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions in the near term. Higher interest rates will dampen private consumption and push up costs for firms, which will also reduce investment. Business bankruptcies will tick up as a result. The risk of a liquidity crisis in the euro zone is low, and the ECB would intervene in such a scenario. Following the banking turmoil in the US and Switzerland in early 2023, Ms Lagarde reassured markets that the bank was ready to "respond as necessary" to preserve financial stability in the euro area if needed.

Economic growth in Italy will slow markedly in 2023, from 3.8% in 2022 to 1.1%, but it will remain above the EU average (0.8%) and much higher than the average over the past ten years (0.2%). Economic activity will be held back by tightening monetary policy, with interest rates rising sharply in the euro zone; high inflation, weighing on consumers' purchasing power; and a subdued external environment, with US and global growth slowing considerably. Nonetheless, supportive factors include a tight labour market, a buoyant tourism sector, EU-funded investment and still-generous fiscal support.
In 2024-27 growth will remain above the pre-pandemic trend (we expect the Italian economy to expand by 1.1% on average), supported by EU-funded recovery investment (especially in digital infrastructure and green technologies).
The main risk to the economic outlook in 2023 and beyond is that the ECB may have to tighten monetary policy further than we currently expect if inflation eases too slowly. This would further slow economic activity into 2024. Given high levels of debt across the region, a sell-off in the sovereign bond markets as interest rates rise further and the ECB progressively reduces its balance sheet is also a risk, especially for highly indebted southern European economies such as Italy. The likelihood of an energy crunch in the 2023/24 winter has decreased significantly since last winter, on the back of comfortable gas reserves and declining gas prices. However, potential supply disruptions and increased competition from Asia, or an especially cold winter, could still cause the gas market to tighten substantially.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In 2022 industry (excluding construction) accounted for 24.7% of nominal gross value added, compared with 25.1% in 2021 and 27.7% in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, increased trade frictions and protectionist tendencies in the context of the US-China rivalry and an expected slowdown in global trade in 2023-24. In 2022 manufacturing accounted for 16.1% of gross value added, down from 17.5% in 2007 and 18.6% in 1996. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP-almost a quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat, which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services. Italy's automotive production, which is mainly geared towards exports, was badly affected by the pandemic and microchip crunch. We expect only a gradual recovery in sales and output over the forecast period as global automotive demand remains subdued in the short term. We expect the Italian automotive industry to see further rationalisation after FCA merged with its French counterpart PSA in early 2021 to form Stellantis. Electric-vehicle sales will pick up pace in 2023-27, supported by government incentives and improving charging infrastructure.
In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as a lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities. This has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation, and research and development has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Activity in the construction sector accounted for 5.4% of gross value added in 2022, up from 4.5% on average in 2017-21. We expect the sector to perform relatively well in 2023-27 compared with recent years, mainly owing to construction-related economic stimulus measures introduced since the pandemic. The "superbonus" scheme allows homeowners a tax deduction of up to 110% on expenses related to property renovation. This can be used in conjunction with the "sismabonus" and "ecobonus" to reduce seismic risk and make energy-efficiency upgrades.
Accounting for about 73% of gross value added, the services sector will continue to rebound following covid-related disruptions. The retail sector also suffered in 2020-21. In contrast, the information and communications technology sector has benefited from the increase in remote working, and we expect a continued rise in its share of real value added. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, that are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotive-Italy's main export sectors-should continue to perform well, despite production in some sectors increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are low.

Italy's consumer price inflation (EU harmonised measure) slowed to 6.4% in July from 6.7% in June-the lowest rate since April 2022, but still well above the ECB's 2% target. Core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy prices) slowed marginally to 5.7% in July, down from 6.1% in June. Headline inflation will ease in 2023, but it is the development of core price pressures that will shape the policy stance of the ECB. We forecast that EU harmonised inflation will slow modestly in 2023, to an average of 6.1% (down from 8.7% in 2022), on the back of declining energy prices. Inflation in Italy will moderate to 2% on average in 2024-27.

After the euro depreciated sharply against the US dollar in 2022, the single currency has appreciated again since early 2023, reaching a 16-month high of US$1.11:EUR1 in mid-July. This was the result of an improvement in the region's terms of trade and current account, after this plunged into a deficit in 2022 as energy prices spiked. The euro will appreciate marginally against the dollar in the remainder of 2023 as we expect the interest-rate differential between the ECB and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) to remain at its narrowest since 2022. The euro:dollar exchange rate will reach US$1.13:EUR1 at year-end (a 5.6% appreciation from end-2022). Over the medium term, the value of the euro will continue to be supported by the euro zone's current-account surplus.

We forecast that the current account will register a surplus in 2023, of 0.9% of GDP, after a deficit of 1.3% in 2022. This is due to an improvement in the trade balance, which will move back into a surplus owing to declining energy prices (Italy is heavily dependent on energy imports). We expect the current-account surplus to widen gradually in 2024-27, to 1.9% of GDP in 2027, driven by a larger trade surplus. The current-account surplus will nonetheless remain below its 2016-20 levels (3% of GDP on average); a rebound in domestic demand in 2024-27 will keep import values high in historical terms, despite a gradual decline in import prices.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy Stocks and flows Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows contracted in 2020 to negative US$22bn, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, and remained negative in 2021 (at US$37.5bn), with inward FDI positive at US$18.9 (0.9% of GDP), before rebounding to US$22bn in 2022. Inward FDI flows increased further to US$31.2bn (1.6% of GDP), driven by solid GDP growth in Italy and EU-funded investment programmes. Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$658bn in 2021, about 60% of total FDI in France, a third of that in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. As a share of GDP, the stock of FDI was 32.7% in 2022, lower than in every other EU country except Greece. FDI outflows have generally been small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy.
Origin and distribution FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2021, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from the Netherlands (US$101bn), France (US$73.8bn), Luxembourg (US$65.3bn), Germany (US$32.9bn), the UK (US$26.4bn) Switzerland (US$21.6bn), and Spain (US$18.4bn), although FDI from the Netherlands and Luxembourg is likely to include investment originating elsewhere using these countries as a conduit.
Determinants The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$51,730 at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022. Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted typical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-tech investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact According to the Italian Trade and Investment Agency (ITA), foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and a half times more in research and development than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central and northern Italy in GDP per head terms (at less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times higher than that in the north.
Potential The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period (2023-27) will be hampered by the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. Over the forecast period a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's ongoing green transition, there could be potential for investment in the still-state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources. Political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature.

The population is projected to decline further Italy's population has been shrinking since 2015-to 59m in 2022, according to the UN's population estimates-and we expect that it will decline further over the long term. This has been mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population, which has outpaced immigration. In 2020 the coronavirus pandemic also put pressure on Italy's death and birth rates and immigrant arrivals. The number of births in Italy was the lowest recorded since the country's unification in 1861, and the death toll was the highest recorded in any year since the second world war. Net migration to Italy dropped significantly to about 88,000 in 2020, or about 1.4 per 1,000 residents-about half the rate of arrivals in 2019. In 2022 Italy's total population dropped by 3.4 per thousand on annual basis-still an improvement compared with 2020-21. The birth rate was at an all-time low, while mortality remained high but fell compared with 2020. Italy's migration inflows recovered further in 2022; the net balance was 229,000, only partly counterbalancing the national unfavourable demographic dynamics, characterised by an excess of deaths over births. EIU forecasts that the population will fall over the long term, in line with falling birth rates and despite an expected increase in migration inflows.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population increased from 4.5% in 2005 to 8.6% in 2023. As of January 2023 the foreign population is 5.5m, an increase of 3.9% compared with January 2022. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for more than 11% of the population at end-2022. The five largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians, Moroccans, Chinese and Ukrainians, which together account for about 50% of the total number of foreign residents.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north-east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market. According to Eurostat, the employment rate stood at 64.8% in 2022, 15 percentage points lower than the EU average and the lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 will gradually address some of these issues during the forecast period (2023-27). In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will reflect greater female participation and pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement.
The rise in the proportion of the elderly will put pressure on pensions Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) was an estimated 36% in 2022, already the highest in the EU, and it is predicted to reach 39% by 2027. This trend, combined with the ongoing rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending is already among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP, despite repeated reforms since the early 1990s.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance's projections show that past reforms will result in a gradual decline in public pension spending over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% of GDP in 2013-14. However, a partial rollback in 2018 of a reform introduced in 2011, the most recent effort to improve the social-security system's sustainability, could slow the decline. In its 2019 country-specific recommendations, the European Commission warned Italy of the need to fully implement past pension reforms because "high public spending for old-age pensions restrains other social and growth-enhancing spending items like education and investment, and limits margins to reduce the overall high tax burden and the high public debt".
Changes to past reforms have tended to focus on broadening the possibility of early retirement, which the Commission warned might negatively affect labour supply in a context where Italy is already lagging the EU average for the participation of older workers in employment, thereby hampering potential growth and worsening the sustainability of public debt.

Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of about 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
Cost-consciousness will remain an important consumer trend In 2020 consumer sentiment and spending were constrained by the practical disruptions caused by measures enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as well as by a sharp rise in unemployment. In 2020 retail sales volumes were down by 6.2% compared with 2019, the largest year-on-year fall on record. Supported by the steady rollout of the vaccination programme, the release of pent-up demand and high levels of savings accumulated during successive lockdowns, retail sales volume growth rebounded by 7% in 2021. Consumer activity is likely to remain constrained in the near term, given the deteriorating economic outlook.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at an estimated US$51,730 in 2022. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 55% of that in the north. Development policies over the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 20%-just below the level in France, but significantly above that in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK (all at 16%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period (2023-27), largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low, but interest rates on consumer loans will continue to increase in the first part of our forecast period (2023-24), which will raise the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock. Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to be introduced in order to meet budgetary targets.

Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor over the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's competitiveness substantially. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. This will hold back capital spending in the medium to long term. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment in 2020, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration will be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population over the long-term forecast period (2023-50). We expect Italy's labour market participation rate to rise from the current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age. However, it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72%) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 1% in 2023-50.
External conditions: Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. Small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-tech sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D, innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic "Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short-lived. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. Without more drastic cuts, public spending on pensions will now rise again until late 2040. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government partly rolled back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which will lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth Long-term performance: EIU's baseline forecast is that Italian real GDP growth will average 1.1% per year in 2023-50. The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2023 fell from 107% of the EU average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy, and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change will have a moderate, but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, especially among the country's growing elderly population. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such as citrus fruits and wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination and regional capital, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure. EIU's model to evaluate the impact of climate change on long-term growth finds that the Italian economy will be 2.8% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0" or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the internet of things, cloud technologies, or "big data" analytics. The share rises sharply in firms with 250 or more employees, to about 47%, compared with 6% for firms with fewer than ten employees. In 2020 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.5% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile, in 2021 Italy's technology balance of payments reached an all-time high, with a surplus of EUR2.6bn (from EUR1bn in 2020). Since 2016 a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, and higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - EIU believes that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, will return to form the government after winning the next parliamentary election in April 2024. However, the BJP-led coalition will remain short of a simple majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament) in the forecast period (2023-27), which will maintain checks and balances on the government. Increasing government control of democratic institutions is likely, and the government's Hindu-nationalist agenda will cause social tensions, but the risk of political instability is very low. India will seek closer strategic ties with the US and its allies without aligning itself, while balancing ties with Russia. Relations with China and Pakistan will remain strained.

- The business environment will improve in 2023-27, taking India's global ranking from 64th in the historical period to 51st, out of the 82 countries assessed. India's overall score will surpass China, and exceed peers like Indonesia and the Philippines, raising its regional position. Among non-regional peers, India's score will be above that of Russia (4.43) and Brazil (6.17), but lower than South Africa (6.56). Improvements will be made in areas such as infrastructure, market opportunities and foreign investment. However, slow progress on trade, taxation and labour reforms, as well as regional disparities, will continue to weigh on India's attractiveness.

Economic growth in fiscal years 2023/24-2026/27 (April-March) will average 6% per year, which will exceed peers and steadily raise income levels. Growth will be led by private consumption and government investment, with increasing support from exports. Malaise in private investment and a degree of import dependence will remain, although the former will recover more swiftly. Fiscal policy will focus on capital spending on infrastructure even as consolidation efforts continue through higher tax collections and the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The Indian rupee will face continuous, albeit modest, depreciation pressure over the next five years, owing to the country's current-account deficit. Monetary policy will loosen from 2024, as inflation moderates.

- A growing labour force, which will rise by 0.9% per year on average in 2023-27, will maintain a strong demographic dividend for India. However, reaping the full benefit of the country's young workforce will prove difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities and large skill gaps, which will persist owing to inadequacies in the education system. Underemployment and unemployment will be compounded by a wide gender imbalance, which has worsened since the pandemic. Continued rural to urban migration will add to existing pressures on urban infrastructure. Agriculture will continue to be a major employer of the rural population, although migrant labour will be increasingly absorbed by the construction and low-end services sectors. The manufacturing sector will also provide more work opportunities over time.

- Sustained growth in real GDP will support wage growth and assist the expansion of the middle class, even as GDP per head will remain low. Consumption propensity will remain high in urban areas, and rural standards of living will also improve. We expect that more households will be able to afford premium products in 2023-27. The e-commerce sector will expand strongly, as higher smartphone and internet penetration boosts retail spending.

- India's economic growth will remain stronger than in many developing countries, even as it slows compared to its own historical record. The structure of the economy will gradually become less reliant on agriculture, with industry taking up a greater share, although it will remain a services-driven economy. However, growth will undershoot its potential owing to structural challenges such as inadequate employment opportunities. India's large economy will make it an increasingly influential diplomatic force in multilateral groupings like the G20, but India will maintain its stance of non-alignment to suit domestic strategic freedom.

a EIU estimates. b Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which three wars have been fought (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.4bn people in 2022, according to the UN. India stands as the fifth-largest economy in the world measured in US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates by the World Bank, behind the US, China, Germany and Japan.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: The ruling BJP has made significant progress in passing structural reform since it came to power in 2014. In September 2020, it passed legislation to liberalise labour laws. EIU expects the government to undertake land acquisition reforms only after the general election in 2024 because of substantial resistance by interest groups. Other reforms, such as reducing the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic sectors and leaving non-strategic sectors by privatising SOEs have seen moderate success, as has sealing bilateral trade agreements. Economic liberalisation and trade promotion will remain policy priorities. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority after 2024 as well, when we expect the BJP to secure a third consecutive term of office.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2023-27, including by further digitising tax departments, and linking permanent account numbers to identify tax evaders. This, coupled with a pick-up in economic growth, will support healthy tax collection. Despite reforms including a nation-wide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system remains complex, although not unpredictable.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit widened from US$176.7bn in 2021 to US$279.3bn in 2022, as imports picked up, while the surplus on the country's services account rose from US$102.7bn to US$132.5n in the same period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is technically secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched and democratic elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades with clear, established and orderly transfers of power between governments. The country's two major political parties at the national level are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which has served in more governments than the BJP since independence, often in coalition with smaller regional parties.

Over the past few years regional parties have increasingly gained prominence in many state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics through the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). Regional parties sometimes overshadow the national parties in terms of state-level influence, and they are usually the kingmakers in the formation of political alliances that sway electoral outcomes considerably. Currently, key states including West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have governments led by regional parties

The BJP, which has been in power since 2014, currently holds an absolute majority of 301 out of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house), while a number of smaller parties are also in the NDA coalition. EIU expects the BJP to return to power at the national level after the general election in April-May 2024, but its majority could be smaller than that in 2019, when it secured 303 seats in the Lok Sabha. However, the BJP's majority and vote share will remain comfortable, thus ensuring policy continuity at the national level. As the NDA alliance currently governs 16 of India's 30 state assemblies, policy dissonance between the centre and the states is also limited. The NDA currently falls short of a majority in the upper house, and it is unlikely to secure enough seats to dominate that chamber in our forecast period (2023-27). However, co-operation with non-aligned parties will allow most bills to pass without additional difficulties.

The BJP's ideological approach leans towards Hindu nationalism, mixing social conservatism with a more active foreign and security policy. Its increasing dominance of national and state governments has thus challenged India's secularism. The party has increased its tilt towards rural-focused policies in a move to extend its vote base beyond urban areas.

The opposition Congress, which has a more centre-left ideological approach to socioeconomic issues, has seen its fortunes dwindling since 2014, when it lost national power to the BJP long-running problems, including policy paralysis, corruption and dynastical politics, that eroded its public support. Although Congress, which governs four of India's 30 states, has increasingly lost relevance as a national opposition, the party made a bid to revive itself in July 2023 by forming an alliance with other opposition parties, which includes regional parties, to put up a united front against the BJP in the 2024 general election. However, lacking a cohesive policy agenda and obstructed by partisan considerations, this opposition alliance is unlikely to topple the BJP from power.

Political outlook: Political stability EIU expects the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to complete a full term in office, which ends in May 2024, bolstered by its majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament). However, the BJP-led coalition lacks a simple majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), and this will help to preserve some degree of checks and balances on its ability to pass legislation unilaterally.
Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, will remain the dominant political figure even after the next general election. Mr Modi's deep-seated influence and high approval rating, and the lack of an effective national political opposition, limit risks to political stability. Policies such as last-mile delivery of public services (ensuring that planned reforms reach their intended beneficiaries) and subsidy schemes run by the government will maintain public support. The government will continue to tighten its control over institutions such as the media, limiting public criticism.
The decline in the vote share of the Indian National Congress at state and national elections has reduced its effectiveness as the main national opposition party, and this trend will continue throughout our forecast period. In July 26 parties in the national opposition, including the Congress, formed an alliance called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), to unitedly contest the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the 2024 general election. However, EIU believes that a coalition of ideologically disjointed parties that have little in common other than an intent to unseat the BJP will struggle to formulate election-oriented policies. Overall, the likelihood of the opposition parties deviating from their regional and partisan considerations is low.
Extremist organisations in Kashmir will keep the threat of terrorist attacks elevated and ensure a heavy security presence in the region. The BJP will intensify its Hindu nationalist agenda in the run-up to the 2024 general election. This trend will spark intermittent communal clashes in pockets of the country, but will not lead to widespread social unrest.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The BJP dominates the political landscape at the national level and in half of the nation's state assemblies. This centre-regional political consistency reduces policy disconnect at the regional level and allows the BJP to pass legislations through the lower house of the parliament, where it commands a significant majority. As we expect the NDA's majority to decline after the 2024 general election, this could delay the passing of contentious legislations on land acquisition, labour reforms, privatisation of state owned enterprises, monetisation of government assets, among others, though we do not expect any form of policy paralysis or parliament impasses like those seen before 2014. Although the ruling NDA is unlikely to attain a simple majority in the upper house in the forecast period, it will be able to facilitate the passage of bills with the support of some independent parties.
Support for the BJP and Mr Modi, who will remain the BJP's prime ministerial candidate in 2024, will remain strong, especially among business factions and at the rural level. At the state level, the BJP will perform inconsistently, winning some but losing other states, as state-level election agenda and priorities vary considerably from those at the national level. The party's Hindu nationalist agenda, its failure to create sufficient employment opportunities and its resolve to promote unpopular structural reforms, such as relaxing labour laws or introducing agricultural market reforms, will intermittently undermine its performance in state elections.
The BJP has been an advocate of competitive federalism, which encourages competition between India's states. We believe that this approach will lead to an improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west of the country. However, it is also likely to deepen economic disparities between India's more economically successful states and its laggards, increasing social friction, competition for fiscal resources and pressure for migration between regions.
The BJP's dominance of national politics has weakened checks and balances within India's polity, although an expected smaller majority for the BJP after the 2024 elections will strengthen the hand of opposition parties, which will modestly improve the quality of India's democracy over 2023-27. There have been instances of pressure on media houses, although content that is critical of the government is generally allowed to be published and broadcast. The judiciary is one of the better functioning institutions with a strong independent streak, and judges have been vocally critical of the government's actions in the recent past. Judicial challenges to the government's policies towards minority religions could also be a point of friction. Corruption and tardiness in the bureaucracy will persist over 2023-27.
Political outlook: Election watch We expect the BJP to retain power in the next general election, due in May 2024, given the advantages of incumbency and last-mile delivery on reforms, and Mr Modi's popularity. Its majority will be smaller than in 2019, when it secured 303 out of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha. Nonetheless, the BJP's majority and vote share will be sufficient for the NDA to secure a majority, thus ensuring policy continuity at the national level. Mr Modi will remain the BJP's candidate for prime minister, although his advanced age may imply that he will hand over the position to another party member after 2025.
We expect Rahul Gandhi, the de facto leader of Congress, who is embroiled in a defamation case, to be Mr Modi's election opponent. Although his case will be ongoing at the time of the election, he is unlikely to be disqualified from running for office. His previously low popularity among the electorate will be bolstered by his outreach efforts, such as the Unite India March held in early 2023, but will still fall short of Mr Modi's.
In May 2023 the Congress, which governs four of India's 30 states, won a key state election in the southern state of Karnataka, raising modestly its popularity and support base. The outcome of state elections to be held in late 2023 will be a mixed bag for the BJP, as the Congress will offer stiff competition in major states.
Jammu and Kashmir, which was placed under the governor's rule in 2018, will also hold assembly elections in 2023. The list of voters was finalised in May 2023, and we expect the Election Commission of India to announce final dates for the elections in the second half of 2023.
Political outlook: International relations India's presidency of the G20 in 2023 means that it will have to contend with diplomatic issues related to a global economic slowdown, food security concerns, climate sustainability and the conflicting geopolitical stances of various members. Mr Modi will aim to ensure that India's agenda, which prioritises climate financing, supply-chain security and faster digital uptake for developing countries, is not a hostage to the clashing interests of China, Russia and the US.
India will continue to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. With historically strong diplomatic and defence relations with Russia and an increasing reliance on that country's energy imports, India will resist pressure to join international condemnation of Russia. At the same time India will develop stronger diplomatic and defence bonds with the US and its allies (through means such as the Quad, an informal diplomatic grouping that also includes the US, Japan and Australia) and will seek to diversify away from its reliance on Russian defence equipment, in what will amount to a gradual geopolitical shift. These strengthening diplomatic ties will boost co-operation on critical technology in areas like semiconductor production and defence. However, India will not formally align itself with the US, but will retain independence in foreign policy to give space to its domestic considerations.
India will also develop deeper ties with France, the UAE and Canada based on defence, trade and migration priorities. China-inclusive blocs like the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS (comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) will fall down India's international agenda.
India's relations with China will remain tense with persisting mistrust as both sides maintain a large military presence and advanced weaponry along their contested border. This raises the risk of military clashes in 2023-27, although a full-blown conflict is outside our core forecast. Relations with Pakistan will remain strained against a backdrop of cross-border terrorism and a decades-long sovereignty dispute over Kashmir, although a military conflict is unlikely given both nations' nuclear arsenals.

Overview: India's overall score in EIU's business environment rankings rises to 6.3 in 2023-27, from 5.27 in 2018-22, propelling the country's rise in global and regional ranks. Regional peers Vietnam and Thailand still rank higher than India, but India will overtake the Philippines and China in the quality of business environment. The biggest improvements will stem from continued efforts on trade liberalisation, foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitation and infrastructure upgrades.
Strengths: India's main strengths are market opportunities and the macroeconomic environment. India is the only single market that offers a potential scale comparable to that of China. Alongside intrinsic capabilities including solid economic fundamentals, a sound digital infrastructure and favourable demographics, more policy support will be introduced to attract manufacturing investment.
Weaknesses: Decades of underfunding has led to insufficient transport and logistical infrastructure, which will continue to prevent the economy from reaching its full potential. However, significant public investment has been made in this area in recent years, and the outlook is constructive. India's political environment will remain a constraint, as bureaucracy and red tape persist, and policy inconsistency at a federal level remains.
What to watch
- India will gradually seal bilateral trade deals with more countries by the end of our forecast period, as the government works to facilitate international trade.
- After the general election in 2024, the government will attempt to ease land acquisition laws using land bank data and implement labour laws uniformly across states to reduce costs for businesses.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: The government maintains its drive to privatise inefficient state-owned companies, although progress in the monetisation of infrastructure assets is likely to be quicker.
2025-27: The rationalisation of liquidation and bankruptcy laws continues. Court backlogs start to ease.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Tweaks to Production Linked Incentives are made to encourage domestic production; the schemes are extended to more sectors such as chemicals and shipping grade containers. Restrictions remain in place against Chinese investment.
2025-27: Foreign investment in export manufacturing and e-commerce increases markedly.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: The government continues to support domestic manufacturing via tariff and non-tariff barriers.
2025-27: A diluted FTA is finalised with the EU, and a broader Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Australia is signed. The usage of the rupee for international trade with India rises, especially for African, Latin American and Middle Eastern trade partners.
Taxes 2023-24: Corrections are made to the inverted duty structure (inputs being taxed higher than final output) under the goods and services tax regime, while formalisation rises. This will expand the tax base.
2025-27: The government brings more individuals and corporations under the tax ambit.
Financing 2023-24: The inclusion of Indian bonds on global indices by 2024 boosts foreign capital inflows.
2025-27: Consolidation continues. The "bad bank" achieves limited success in realising value from its stressed assets. Initial public offerings for start-ups rise on the stock market, with decent uptake.
The labour market 2023-24: Unemployment in urban areas falls gradually, as do registrations under the rural employment guarantee scheme.
2025-27: A phased implementation of the four new labour laws commences across states to reduce regional disparity.
Infrastructure 2023-24: A dedicated freight corridor railway, connecting Mumbai with West Bengal, becomes operational.
2025-27: Electricity and transport infrastructure improves. The international airport at Greater Noida and the construction of defence corridors are completed. Major progress towards climate goals is stymied by financing and just transition.
Technological readiness 2023-24: The rollout of 5G technology accelerates. There is further progress on digitalising the delivery of public services, in order to cut corruption and promote "last-mile delivery".
2025-27: The use of emerging technologies including blockchain, internet of things and artificial intelligence, accelerates.

Overview: India's score for the macroeconomic environment category rises from 6.3 to 7.2 in 2023-27, placing it higher in the regional ranking than Indonesia and China. Strong growth by regional standards, a benign inflation outlook, continued fiscal consolidation and low financial market volatility will support the score. Predictability in policymaking will be high. The external sector will benefit from strong export growth, but the current account will remain in deficit throughout 2023-27.
Strengths: India's economic growth will remain strong at about 6% per year over the forecast period, outstripping most regional peers. Continued fiscal consolidation, deep foreign-exchange reserves and the low exposure to exchange-rate risks of the government debts (they are largely domestically owned) will ensure solid debt repayment capacities.
Weaknesses: The twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will persist, keeping the domestic currency on a depreciatory trend over much of the forecast period. India's significant import dependence for petroleum, gold, raw materials and machinery will also continue over the forecast period. Inflation will be dictated by the vagaries of monsoons, as irrigation facilities will remain inadequate.
What to watch
- Internationalisation of the rupee will gradually pick up speed. This will mitigate exchange-rate volatility, reduce the current-account deficit and incentivise foreign investment inflows.
- The government will gradually curtail capital spending on infrastructure in favour of fiscal consolidation. This will limit the multiplier effect of such spending on growth, while also slowing infrastructure projects. However, private sector investment will offset some of this moderation.

Overview: India's score in this category improves from 4.5 to 5.8 in 2023-27 to push it up the regional table by one spot, placing India between Vietnam (11th) and Malaysia (ninth). The government will facilitate business competition in sectors like shipping, steel and energy, which will bolster opportunities in these sectors. Insufficient protection of intellectual property and the persistence of business lobbying, which gives large corporates an edge, will remain drags on the score.
Strengths: Long-running efforts to privatise state-owned enterprises will reduce the oversized distorting impact of the state sector on the economy. Deregulation of most prices in the economy, including sensitive commodities in the petroleum sector, will strengthen market mechanisms to determine prices. The initiative to monetise infrastructure assets in sectors like roads, railways and energy is expected to gain traction. The monetisation of public-sector brownfield assets including coal blocks and other mineral assets, highway stretches and power transmission lines, brought in Rs1.4trn (US$16.8bn) in 2022/23 against a target of Rs1.62trn, and this drive will continue. The government has encouraged competition among states by allowing them to experiment on pro-business liberalisation over and beyond the regulations imposed centrally.
Weaknesses: Market-friendly reforms are likely to face resistance from vested interest groups. One example is the comprehensive agriculture sector reforms, which were rolled back in 2021 in the face of sustained political pressure. Delays to planned privatisation and sales will remain a constant risk, amid opposition from labour unions, a lack of private-sector participation and issues with valuation. Powerful lobbies with vested interests will distort government policies. Protection of intellectual property remains poor.
What to watch
- More realistic targets will be set for selling stakes in state-owned enterprises. Important privatisation drives will span sectors including downstream oil marketing, shipping, steel and logistics.
- The protection of intellectual property will improve gradually, reflecting pressure from domestic companies to toughen enforcement as local levels of investment in research and development (R&D) increase. Moreover, advances on this front will be compelled by India's negotiations for free-trade agreements. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy, with courts in more developed parts of the country offering better levels of protection.

Overview: India's score for policy towards foreign investment improves substantially in 2023-27, putting its rank at par with the Philippines, and above Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. The gains will be made by a more liberal regime towards foreign investment, as well as interest from multinationals to diversify supply chains beyond China, in conjunction with government policy to make India a more attractive manufacturing destination. Meanwhile, investor protections will strengthen from a low base.
Strengths: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime since 2014. Foreign investment has branched beyond traditional services and software sectors to include infrastructure, telecommunications and domestic trade. India's large domestic market, which is the only one comparable to China, will remain lucrative for foreign investors looking to capture it. The loosening of rules regarding government approvals, strong growth and low costs will continue to increase India's attractiveness to international investors.
Weaknesses: Some important sectors of the economy, such as multi-brand retail, banking, pensions and media, will remain subject to hard FDI caps and/or more onerous approval processes. Discrimination and restrictions against investment from China will persist. The impact of liberalisation efforts will filter through slowly, owing in part to continued problems with the business environment in areas such as land acquisition. Emerging markets in South-east Asia will also create intense competition for FDI. Excessive bureaucracy and red tape will remain hurdles. India's slow and onerous judicial system will continue to undermine investor confidence for dispute resolution.
What to watch
- The government will seek to give impetus to its "self-reliant India" initiative, which looks to boost local manufacturing through the production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes. The PLI schemes will be refined and expanded to other sectors, creating opportunities for foreign investment in domestic manufacturing.
- A gradual pick-up in foreign investment in the renewable energy sector will take place in the forecast period, as India seeks more climate-friendly investments to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2070. Solar and wind energy projects will be the major areas for investment.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: The score for this category strengthens in 2023-27, though India still ranks behind Indonesia (12th), Philippines (11th) and Vietnam (tenth). Although import reliance and tariff barriers will persist, progress will be made on bilateral free-trade agreements, while some modest liberalisation of the capital account will proceed.
Strengths: In recent years the government has reduced an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under a general scheme for goods and services. It has also invested in infrastructure; reduced costs through greater use of online platforms; permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures; and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. These measures form part of a broader effort to stimulate exports through supply-side reforms that are intended to boost the competitiveness of Indian exporters. Trade agreements were concluded with the UAE and Australia in 2022, whose benefits should filter through in the forecast period for sectors including jewellery and raw materials.
Weaknesses: Tariff and non-tariff barriers have remained high in India, owing in part to the country's reluctance to participate in multilateral free-trade agreements, as well as the strength of India's domestic business lobby. India will remain reluctant to open up lucrative services and consumer-facing industries to foreign participants, which will remain a major obstacle to trade talks. Concerns on dumping and employment will keep India out of multilateral trade agreements and will keep logistic costs high as a result. We expect the government to continue to sanction tariffs on selected manufactured goods in the coming years to promote domestic production. This will also encompass imports of military equipment.
What to watch
- Bilateral free-trade negotiations will move ahead in the forecast period, particularly those with developed countries that depend increasingly on Indian services exports, where the economy enjoys a competitive advantage. We expect ongoing negotiations with partners such as the EU, the Gulf Co-operation Council, Israel and the UK to be concluded, at least in early harvest form, by 2025 at the latest. A final agreement with Australia is likely to be reached in the early part of the forecast period, with a particular focus on strengthening trade in critical rare earth minerals. Trade relations with the US will expand into the realm of defence acquisitions by India.
- The use of the domestic currency, the rupee, to settle international transactions will gradually increase, but it will not reach levels of trade conducted in the Chinese currency, the renminbi. Following the central banks' decision to allow trade in rupees, several countries have opened accounts for such trade, to mitigate risks associated with potential US financial sanctions and disruptions to trade conducted in US dollars.

Business environment outlook: Taxes                
Value of index a   Global rank b   Regional rank c  
2018-22 2023-27 2018-22 2023-27 2018-22 2023-27

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: India's rank for the taxes category stands between China and Japan, and at the same level as Bangladesh in 2023-27. Although the tax regime in India is predictable and stable, it is complex, and a large number of working people and economic activities are not included in the tax base owing to the presence of a large informal economy. However, in recent years the government has used digital avenues to link identity and incomes to taxation dues, thereby expanding the tax base substantially. This has led to steady increases in tax revenue, which will continue. We expect the overall tax system to become more equitable and progressive over time.
Strengths: India's gross tax buoyancy (the ratio of tax growth to GDP growth) has exceeded 1 in recent years, showing a significant rise in taxation levels, especially since the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, which harmonised indirect taxes and created a more unified national single market. The top marginal tax rate for individuals will remain competitive at 30% in the forecast period. A more simplified system was established for corporate tax in 2019, and the government lowered corporate tax rates substantially for domestic firms, offering a lower 22% opt-in tax, down from the standard rate of 30%, to eligible firms that choose not to avail certain deductions. Foreign companies are likely to have significantly more confidence in investing in India, following the passage in 2021 of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act. This essentially abolished the risk of retrospective taxation on transfers of domestic assets, an issue that has pitted the authorities for years against high-profile foreign firms.
Weaknesses: The country's tax system has been a big challenge for businesses, as filing remains a complex task. Under the GST, an inverted duty structure persists, wherein inputs are taxed at a higher rate than the final good or service. The tax regime can sometimes be unpredictable in years when fiscal strains arise.
What to watch
- The far lower corporate tax rate of 15% for newly established manufacturing companies, which was introduced during the 2019 reforms, is scheduled to lapse in 2024. However, it is possible that the lower rate will be extended for another year or two to encourage manufacturing investment.
- The GST Council will continue to take measures to simplify the tax system and streamline rates in the forecast period. Specifically, a rationalisation of GST rates could take the form of more items moving into lower tax brackets. Several key items, including petroleum products, will remain outside the GST coverage.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: In the financing category, India's rank will be at par with Indonesia, Philippines and Bangladesh over 2023-27. The improvement will be led by foreign entities enjoying much greater access to the country's capital markets and fewer financial market distortions. That said, more rapid gains among India's peers will see its global rank deteriorate slightly, from 59th to 60th.
Strengths: India's banking sector is relatively stable, buttressed by large state-owned lenders that often receive direct government support in times of stress. Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, especially in rural areas. Privatisation will continue, but progress is likely to remain sluggish. India has a well-functioning and relatively deep equity market, which is accessible for finance.
Weaknesses: Indian public-sector banks suffer from systemic and long-running inefficiencies. Access to bank credit for some businesses is constrained in part by a long-standing policy to guarantee access to select industries, under a system known as priority-sector lending, which entails minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives. Foreigners lack wider access to Indian debt markets owing to utilisation caps and quotas. Regulation of capital markets is sub-par relative to their size, and poses risks of volatility arising from insufficient oversight.
What to watch
- We expect Indian bonds to be included in the JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) and the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond index in the forecast period. Non-residents own an insignificant 5% of India's US$1trn debt market, in contrast to the high shares seen in peer emerging countries. The inclusion will stimulate foreign inflows into the debt market, as foreign portfolio investors will be eligible to purchase bonds in 14 different tenors with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2050 under the Fully Accessible Route (FAR).
- The pool of savings that can be channelled towards investment will expand, following the passage of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Act in 2021, which ensures that depositors will receive a higher proportion of their savings after the central bank withdraws the license of a troubled lender.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: India's labour market rank lies between South Korea (12th) and Sri Lanka (14th) in 2023-27. Improvement in the forecast period will stem from a higher-quality labour force, particularly in terms of skills and health outcomes, albeit from a weak starting point, as well as a less challenging cost of living environment, which will keep wage growth modest. Meanwhile the country's historically strict labour laws were materially relaxed in 2019-20; this will subsequently lower operational costs for businesses in 2023-27.
Strengths: India's youthful demographic profile is a crucial advantage, promising good availability of labour. India's median age of 28.4 years compares favourably with that of 38.4 years in China. The labour codes passed in 2019 simplify compliance for companies by ensuring a single licensing mechanism for industries; they also provide operational flexibility for small and medium-sized enterprises. They also introduce faster dispute-resolution mechanisms. With minimum-wage norms not being prevalent across Indian industries, the cost of labour, particularly for low-end manufacturing, is likely to remain modest.
Weaknesses: The uniform implementation of the new labour codes across Indian states has been inhibited in recent years by opposition from trade unions, including those affiliated with the BJP. A low participation rate remains a weakness in India's labour market environment, as it consistently falls short of 50%, below peer economies, mainly because female participation in the labour force remains extremely low. Low levels of literacy and technical skills are a further constraint.
What to watch
- The implementation of the four new labour codes across states will be pushed by the BJP government after the 2024 general election. Firms will still have to navigate state-level legislation, as labour is within the list of responsibilities shared by both centre and local authorities.
- The government's skill training programmes to upskill the workforce will improve the quality of workers in 2023-27. However, the migration of qualified Indian workers to the West will create a skills gap, but the workforce will remain far more productive than those in many peer economies.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: India's infrastructure score rises in the forecast period to place the country between Thailand (11th) and Vietnam (13th), on the back of a relatively broad-based improvement in digital and physical infrastructure through substantial government-led investment. We expect the country to make strides in construction and upgrading of roads and highways in 2023-27 and, to a lesser extent, for air and sea transport infrastructure, leading to an overall improvement in the infrastructural availability. Supply of power will also be more reliable in the forecast period as coal offtake and throughput increase.
Strengths: Government initiatives lead the way of addressing weaknesses in India's infrastructure. Recent budgets have delivered strong increases in infrastructure-related capital spending, geared towards defence, energy, telecoms and transport. Flagship initiatives such as Bharatmala (a network of cross-country roads and highways), Sagarmala (connecting and developing port infrastructure), Udaan (the development of regional airports in poorly served locales) and the National Infrastructure Pipeline (a set of infrastructure projects to be undertaken by 2025) are helping to deliver a more co-ordinated approach.
Weaknesses: Time and cost overruns will be a recurring challenge in relation to infrastructure projects. Despite expedited government clearances for industrial projects in recent years, difficulties in land acquisition and high company leverage ratios continue to be obstacles to progress. The road ahead for India in terms of infrastructure upgrade will still be very long. For example, Mumbai's Nhava Sheva Port, which is India's largest, ranked only 35th on the global port capacity list in 2020, and handles only a tenth of the capacity of Shanghai's main port in China (the world's largest port).
What to watch
- The government will focus on areas like reliable and consistent electricity supply, intermodal freight transfers, and inland waterways. Industrial corridors being developed across the country will smooth logistical challenges. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development started operations in 2022, and will eventually be bestowed with a Rs1trn lending facility. The limited returns on investment in infrastructure mean that private-sector participation will remain limited beyond the leasing of ports and airports.
- The first phase of Bharatmala is aimed at connecting 550 of the country's districts through the highway network, up from only 300 in 2017. Deliberations for the second phase are now under way, envisioning the construction of more than 5,000km in expressways, including the 745km Pune-Bengaluru highway that will enhance the Delhi-Mumbai corridor. Under Sagarmala, the government has completed 209 port-related developments as at late 2022. The scheme has a target of 802 projects to be completed by 2035; of the 593 that have yet to be completed, 221 are already under way.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: In the technological readiness category, India will rank ahead of Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia in the forecast period. Much of the increase in India's score will come from a material improvement in internet accessibility and speed, which will be complemented by an increase in the delivery of government services online and a more conducive environment for e-commerce. However, greater coverage will expose individuals and businesses to more cyber-security risks, and we expect the country to suffer a setback on this front, as its current capabilities against cybercrimes require improvement.
Strengths: The country boasts a relatively advanced R&D infrastructure, owing in part to the education system's historical bias towards higher education institutions. This has facilitated the development of research-intensive sectors. India has also been an enthusiastic adopter of e-government systems, seeking to improve the effectiveness of public service delivery. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the percentage of the population using the internet had risen to 46% by 2021 (the latest available data), from just 10% a decade earlier. Charges for telecoms and internet services are low, making them broadly affordable for even poorer households.
Weaknesses: The government's restrictions on e-commerce businesses will remain in place over the next few years to protect small bricks-and-mortar businesses, and policies in this space could be unpredictable, as this is a novel domain. According to the Speedtest Global Index, India ranked 84th out of 181 countries in May 2023 for fixed broadband connectivity speed.
What to watch
- Emerging technologies in the Indian economy include blockchain, which has the potential to disrupt industries such as banking, healthcare, logistics and real estate. The internet of things, which refers to the interconnectedness of physical devices and objects that are equipped with sensors and software, is enabling new applications in areas such as smart cities, while artificial intelligence is being used in a number of sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing and agriculture.
- The rapid expansion of e-commerce will widen the market for manufacturing firms, given the potential of India's large and rapidly growing consumer class. E-commerce has become the focal point of India's digital revolution, owing to factors such as a growing middle class, the availability of relatively cheap mobile connections and skilled labour to develop indigenous technology platforms. Structural changes in spending behaviour prompted by the pandemic are likely to hasten the uptake of e-commerce, particularly in the retail sector. The launch of 5G networks will contribute to higher internet speeds in the forecast period. 5G services were rolled out in October 2022 in major urban areas, and this expansion will continue in 2023-27, led by the likes of telecoms companies Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Infrastructure development will remain a policy focus, encompassing the creation and upgrading of ports, logistics parks, roads and railway networks as the country seeks to improve infrastructure in order to benefit from the current global trend of supply-chain diversification. Physical infrastructure initiatives like Bharatmala (a roads and highways project), Sagarmala (a port development), dedicated freight corridors in the east and west of the country, and Udaan (regional airports for poorly served destinations) are due for completion within the forecast period and will gradually lower logistics costs. A National Logistics Policy will help to create the digital infrastructure to expedite last-mile delivery of goods and improve the cost-competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. The introduction of the Competition (Amendment) Act in April 2023 will help to limit anti-competitive practices.
Improved infrastructure and gradual regulatory reform will improve India's business environment, leading to higher flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector. India will continue to fall behind South-east Asian economies in attracting high value-added manufacturing activities owing to red tape, slow progress on reforms and land-acquisition difficulties.
India will make gradual progress towards its climate goals, which include reaching net zero by 2070. This will be balanced against imperatives such as economic development, poverty eradication and access to necessary finance and raw materials (largely controlled by China) to transition sustainably. Initiatives include the National Hydrogen Mission, which aims to make India a green hydrogen hub, and a nationwide charging network for electric vehicles.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Budget balance -6.4 -5.9 -5.5 -5.1 -4.8 -4.4
Government debt 57.6 58.7 59.5 60.3 61.0 61.9
The budget for fiscal year 2023/24 (April-March) aims to improve government expenditure through increased capital spending. This outlay will be geared towards defence, renewable energy, telecommunications and transport infrastructure. The government has reduced its subsidy spending budget, freeing up budgetary space for productive spending. The government will continue to import high volumes of crude oil from Russia at discounted prices in order to save on fuel subsidy costs.
India's government will continue to struggle with the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Overall, some fiscal consolidation will occur in 2023/24.
The government will broaden the tax base and strengthen compliance to help to consolidate the public finances after the 2024 election. Although public debt will average slightly more than 60% of GDP in 2023-27, most of this will be held domestically, reducing exchange-rate risks associated with external debt repayment. The federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true size of the deficit: individual state deficits and the liabilities of public-sector units place a fiscal burden on the central government.

Long-term interest rate (year-end) 7.2 7.2 7.1 6.4 6.7 6.7
After 250 basis points of cumulative rate increases undertaken since May 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) has maintained the policy rate at 6.5%-its highest level since 2016. Although we expect a disruption in the recent trend of moderating inflation, this will not prompt further monetary tightening, as consumer price inflation will remain within the 6% upper bound of the RBI's inflation target range. Robust supply- and demand-side indicators, including air-passenger traffic, petroleum consumption, toll collections and vehicle purchases, indicate that the RBI will not be prompted to ease monetary policy to support growth this year.
EIU forecasts that the central bank will keep policy interest rates unchanged until mid-2024. We expect monetary easing to start in the third quarter of 2024 to reduce some pressure on households and businesses. Rate reductions will lower the policy rate to 5% by the end of 2027.

We forecast that real GDP will grow by 6.2% in 2023/24 (April-March), slowing from 7.3% in 2022/23. Private consumption demand has slowed, particularly in areas like cars, electronics, apparels and recreation services as pent-up demand is satiated. However, urban demand for travel and leisure activities will pick up again in the festive season at end-2023. A recovery in private investment will be capped by higher interest rates, although appetite will prove more resilient in sectors such as real estate, logistics and chemicals. A continued pause in monetary tightening will support credit growth amid improved market confidence in the second half of the 2023/24 financial year (October-March). A substantial capital outlay in the budget for 2023/24, focused on infrastructure, will ensure continued growth in overall investment. The agriculture sector will face headwinds from adverse weather in 2023 in the form of a subdued monsoon and warmer than usual temperatures.
India's working-age population is expected to exceed 1bn by the end of this decade. Services included in the manufacturing ecosystem will be meaningful generators of employment.
The services sector will remain a resilient driver of growth over the forecast period, with strong demand in retail trade, software services, commercial real estate and travel. The productivity of the agricultural sector will suffer from climate change amid inadequate irrigation facilities, prompting greater rural to urban migration. Abundant labour availability for manufacturing and construction sectors will keep wages low. In the medium term government initiatives to promote scientific warehousing and capital investment will support growth in the primary sector to an extent, although its share in GDP will continuously decline.
An emerging trend of international firms extending their manufacturing activities into India to diversify their supply chains will support growth in the manufacturing sector in 2023-27. The sectors promoted under the government's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes-such as automotive, white goods, solar photovoltaic modules and speciality steel-will develop through greater domestic and foreign investment.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends India's post-pandemic economic rebound in 2022-23 has been driven by strong private consumption growth, especially by the urban population. Demand for discretionary goods and services like travel remained strong till early 2023, after which there was some tapering in relative terms. India will remain a consumption-driven economy (private consumption accounts for about 55% of GDP). In recent years, India has developed its export potential, but this will remain confined to labour-intensive, low value-added goods over the first part of our forecast period (2023-27), in addition to its considerable advantage in services exports. Export promotion schemes from the government, an interest in the large and under-explored domestic market, and a desire to branch out operations beyond China have led multinationals to enter partnerships with domestic firms to pursue export-related manufacturing. A few areas where exports will make significant headway include pharmaceuticals, finished electronic goods, engineering goods, chemicals and refined petroleum products. Exports will continue to make larger contributions to growth. India's import dependence for key items like petroleum, gold, coal, machinery and electronic components will persist over our forecast period, as India firms try to build capabilities in these areas, but progress is slow owing to bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of cost competitiveness.
Agriculture will remain dependent on the vagaries of monsoon rainfall We expect agriculture, which is a major rural occupation to gradually become less important in contributing to growth as the economy moves up the value chain and productivity improves. However, the primary sector will continue to employ nearly half of the population, and its share in GDP will contract only modestly from 15% of GDP in 2022/23 to 14.5% of GDP by 2026/27. Agricultural productivity will remain low because of a lack of irrigation development (around half of arable land is irrigated in India), which will keep the dependence on monsoon rainfall intact. The slow development of infrastructure against extreme weather conditions will also undermine agricultural production, even as more heat-resistant crop varieties are slowly developed and introduced. Consequently, the government has increased funding for irrigation schemes and crop insurance. However, capital investment into agriculture will remain inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of short-term grants and subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers, who form an important vote bank. Income from agriculture will remain meagre, as subsistence farming will continue to be predominant. Although the reform to liberalise the marketing of agriculture produce and create self-sufficiency introduced in 2020 was rolled back amid protests in 2021, we believe that it will be reintroduced in a more acceptable format after the general election in 2024, and will support the outlook for the agriculture sector. As employment opportunities open up in the secondary and tertiary sectors, there will be a gradual shift in employment away from agriculture.
Manufacturing will gain traction as industries set up base in India The industrial sector will expand at a robust pace, as the business environment improves and the country's strong economic growth outlook attracts investment. Most opportunities are to be found in downstream activities, owing to the low labour costs. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes form the bedrock of the government's plans to convert India into a global manufacturing hub, and are operational in 15 sectors of the economy, including high value-added manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors, large-scale electronics, pharmaceutical ingredients and specialty steel. Vehicles, speciality steel, high-efficiency solar panels, mobile phones, electronics components, pharmaceuticals and food-processing will lead manufacturing growth as these have attracted greater investment. Big-ticket investment projects in sectors such as steelmaking and white goods will remain laggards owing to slow approvals, while manufacture in advanced areas like semiconductors will take off only beyond 2027. The government will expand the PLI ambit to cover more sectors, including chemicals and petrochemicals and shipping-grade containers. Persistently rising FDI will be channelled to manufacturing sectors, as some liberalisation of the laws governing land acquisition and the labour regime (especially local sourcing) will help to underpin growth in the sector. Policy continuity will also bolster confidence in foreign investor sentiment. However, India's absence from major regional trade blocs, its high levels of bureaucratic red tape, difficulties in land acquisition and high corporate leverage levels will impede streamlined export productivity. The share of industry in total GDP will increase slightly from 31% in 2022/23 to 31.8% in 2026/27.
Services like travel, hospitality and domestic trade will continue to flourish The services sector will account for 55.7% of GDP on average in 2022/23 to 2026/27, remaining the primary engine of economic expansion over this decade. The sector is particularly resilient to external shocks, as displayed during the pandemic, as it is largely domestic-driven. Its expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as telecommunications and business services, as well as by services in numerous high potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, retailing, hospitality and education. Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services will remain a major source of export revenue, even as growth will face increased competition from countries such as the Philippines.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Consumer prices 6.7 5.5 4.6 4.3 4.6 4.1
Average wages 8.8 8.4 7.9 8.0 8.1 7.7
Real wages 2.0 2.8 3.2 3.6 3.4 3.4
Unit labour costs (US$) -2.2 1.2 5.4 2.4 1.8 3.7
We forecast that consumer price inflation will decelerate from an average of 6.7% in 2022 to 5.5% in 2023 as global commodity prices moderate. Inflationary pressures will moderate in line with easing demand, although resilient services demand will enable producers to pass on costs to consumers, which will prevent a steep moderation in core inflation. Food price inflation will remain high over the rest of 2023, as floods in July have destroyed standing crops. Additionally, subdued agricultural output amid warmer temperatures than usual will keep food prices elevated. Thus, headline inflation will remain closer to the higher end of the RBI's target range of 2-6% in the rest of 2023.
We expect consumer price inflation to remain close to the midpoint of the RBI's inflation target band. Wage inflation will remain modest for the agricultural and industrial sectors amid excess labour supply, although wages for high-end services will rise moderately. Improvements in the logistics infrastructure should boost supply-chain efficiency, reducing supply-driven price pressures.
We forecast that producer price inflation will decelerate significantly from 12.1% in 2022 to 0.3% in 2023. This will be driven by softer commodity prices, reduced supply disruption and a more modest depreciation of the domestic currency, bringing down imported inflation. Producer price inflation will average 2.8% in 2024-27.

We expect depreciatory pressure on the local currency, the rupee, to moderate in the coming months as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) comes to the end of its monetary tightening cycle, easing appreciatory pressure on the dollar. India's strong economic growth, easing inflation and a narrowing current-account deficit as a result of moderating global commodity prices will support the rupee. However, state elections towards the end of 2023 will undermine sentiment for the rupee and keep the exchange rate volatile. We forecast that the local currency will strengthen to about Rs81.2:US$1 at end-2023, from Rs82.8:US$1 a year earlier.
The rupee is expected to face depreciation pressures in early 2024 as general election approaches, keeping sentiment for Indian assets subdued. The expected victory of the BJP in the election, ensuring policy continuity, will strengthen the rupee from mid-2024.
We forecast that a narrow but persistent current-account deficit will keep the rupee on a mild depreciatory trend in 2024-27. However, strong capital inflows and robust GDP growth will ensure a softer pace of depreciation than before the pandemic. The RBI has replenished its foreign-exchange reserves over 2023, and will curb excessive volatility in exchange rates.

We forecast that the current-account deficit will narrow from 2.7% of GDP in 2022 to the equivalent of 1.3% of GDP in 2023, amid a moderation in global commodity prices. Slower expansion in key export markets will affect the pace of goods export growth in 2023, but exports in certain segments will perform well, including engineering goods, electronics, pharmaceuticals, garments and base metals. The services sector and the secondary account will maintain a considerable surplus. Remittances from expatriate Indians will remain strong.
As India develops more manufacturing capacity, the outlook for exports is positive over the remainder of our forecast period. India will focus on setting up bilateral trade settlements using the rupee, to avoid dependence on US dollar and euro trade. The move will narrow the current-account deficit later in our forecast period, incentivise foreign investment inflows and increase India's geopolitical standing.
The government will also focus on sealing bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Israel, the EU, the Gulf states and countries in the African Union, some of which will be finalised in an early-harvest form by 2025. India will remain outside major regional multilateral free-trade pacts, hindering its chances of emerging as a major manufacturing hub. India's experience with multilateral trade deals has been one of exports being overshadowed by faster import growth, and protectionist sentiment on this point is unlikely to be reversed. Imports not covered under FTAs are likely to continue facing high tariffs, as the government will focus on incentivising import substitution in sectors such as chemicals, automotive components, bicycle parts and agro-based items.
The PLI scheme for the domestic manufacture of electronics, pharmaceuticals, batteries and solar panels (among other products) will continue to attract inflows of FDI. Portfolio inflows in the medium term will be supported by a robust growth outlook.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India Stocks and flows India's large market and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have been strong in recent years, totalling US$251bn in 2018-22, compared with a total of US$191bn in the five years before that. Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$564bn in 2022 (markedly higher than in 2019, when it totalled US$427bn). Total FDI inflows to India over 2018-22 have outstripped Asian peers like Indonesia (US$106bn), Thailand (US$54bn) and the Philippines (US$41bn) by a large margin, but they have significantly undershot FDI flows to China (US$799bn).
Origin and distribution According to the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the largest source of FDI has historically been Mauritius, which accounted for 26% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2023. (Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons.) With a similar tax treaty and some of the lowest rates of taxation in Asia, Singapore is in second place; the city state accounted for 23% of cumulative inflows in 2000-23. It was followed by the US (9%), the Netherlands (7%), Japan (6%) and the UK (5%). More recently, over 2020-23, FDI inflows from Singapore and the US have significantly surpassed flows from Mauritius, amid improving interest in India.
The most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$102.8bn between April 2000 and March 2023, and accounted for 16% of cumulative inflows, according to the DPIIT. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient (15% of cumulative flows), attracting US$94.9bn in the same period. The Indian state of Maharashtra (which boasts the country's financial centre, Mumbai) attracts most FDI, garnering 29% of the total between October 2019 and March 2023, followed by Karnataka (24%) and Gujarat (17%) in the same period.
Determinants India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since taking office the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, insurance and single-brand retailing. It also provides a product-linked incentive that offers financial compensation for direct investments in emerging sectors such as electronics. The current administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed. Although structural reforms will make headway, difficulty in acquiring land, restrictive rules on local sourcing and existing high leverage on Indian companies' balance sheets will create difficulties. Rules related to the hiring and firing of employees have loosened considerably, but disparities exist among states, with western and southern states having more flexible rules. The slow legal system also acts as a deterrent to the inflow of investment and hampers the ease of conducting business in India for foreigners.
Impact The sectoral distribution of FDI into India has actually changed significantly over time. While the share of services in FDI has fallen from 17% in 2014-16 to 12% in 2020-23, the shares of the computer software and hardware sector (from 10% to 31%), infrastructure (from 1% to 8%) have risen. FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Although call centres and other forms of back-office administration have been important industries, India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, automobile, telecommunications and construction sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The online retail sector has gained importance over the pandemic, with US-based Amazon and Walmart (through its Flipkart subsidiary) having a significant presence in the e-commerce sector. Many online start-ups have been able to attract attention from venture capitalists and internet giants in the West. However, in offline retail, a significant relaxation of regulations for multibrand retailers is unlikely to occur in 2023-27. The product-linked incentive will spur investment in the electronics sector, but the sector is unlikely to expand significantly into a new pillar industry. Over 2015-22, India has secured US$78bn in terms of FDI in renewable energy, according to UNCTAD reports, superseded by Brazil (US$114.8bn), Vietnam (US$106.8bn) and Chile (US$84.6bn). This will be an increasingly competitive and lucrative area for FDI in India, as the country seeks to transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.
Potential Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI. However, the potential for even stronger inflows is reduced by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors will be important areas for FDI in 2023-27. Biotechnology, electronics and vehicle manufacturing (including parts) could also attract significant interest over the next five years amid significant government support.

Population growth will slow as education rises and fertility rates fall EIU forecasts that the population growth will remain slower than 1% per year in 2023-27, as improving living standards, faster urbanisation and better career opportunities for women reduce fertility rates. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2019-21, India's overall fertility rate has fallen to two per woman, lower than the replacement rate of 2.1-a level that is usually viewed as sufficient to replace a whole generation or keep the population from declining without immigration. However, the populations of poor and populous states will continue to grow strongly, increasing social tensions and exerting further pressure on the already sub-par levels of infrastructure in these states.
Men will continue to outnumber women in the population by a significant margin over the forecast period. Recent research from the National Family Health Survey shows that the gender ratio of newborns is 929 girls per 1,000 boys for the country as a whole, showing that gender selection is skewed towards males in most parts of the country owing to a traditional preference for male children. The disproportionate gender ratio also spills over to educational attainment and workforce contribution, as these are more available to men than women. Government policies aimed at improving women's education and employment have seen uneven uptake in rural belts, which remain conservative and prioritise males. We expect this disparity to wane with increased education among women. However, the proportion of women in the workforce is expected to remain low, as concerns such as house work, caregiving, safety and low wages compared to their male counterparts persist.
Caste-centric policies will continue to be enacted by successive governments Caste factors will be another important source of social strain within India in 2023-27. All governments have traditionally been supportive of affirmative action policies that favour caste-based "reservations" (quotas) for jobs and public services such as education for low-status castes, and this will continue. Despite this, the trend of workers moving from conservative rural regions to more metropolitan urban areas will help to weaken the roots of the caste system.
UN estimates show that only 35% of the Indian population lived in urban areas in 2021, which was lower than many regional peers such as Vietnam (38%), the Philippines (47%), Thailand (52%) and Indonesia (57%). A dearth of suitable employment opportunities in rural areas of India will spur greater migration to urban areas, raising the urbanisation rate over 2023-27. However, infrastructure in urban areas will fail to keep pace with migration. Mumbai, the country's financial capital, usually receives the greatest influx of migrants, and the city's infrastructure upgrades already run significantly behind schedule. Consequently, despite significant public spending, the mismatch between urbanisation and infrastructure will hinder productivity.
Educational focus will move from the public to the private sector Growth in the working-age population will remain relatively strong in 2023-27, and this will preserve India's appeal in terms of labour supply. However, unlocking the economic benefits of population growth will prove challenging, as India's manufacturing sector has failed to take off in a similar manner to that of China. Robust growth in the working-age population, coupled with a misalignment of job market supply and demand, risks straining economic growth prospects in the medium term. The overall labour participation rate consistently falls short of 50%, indicating that many qualified individuals opt not to join the labour force owing to the dearth of lucrative opportunities. Underemployment is also prevalent in the job market, with some labour-market participants finding it challenging to obtain positions matching their skill levels. Although the manufacturing sector is set to grow, the wider application of industrial automation, which the government strongly supports, is likely to hamper job creation. The workforce moving out of agriculture will be increasingly absorbed in services, although low-skilled workers will still be largely employed in agriculture or construction sectors.
An important challenge is also the poor state of primary-level education. Although enrolment rates are high, educational outcomes remain sub-par in state-funded schools towing to underqualified teachers, the impact of India's caste system and bad infrastructure. Enrolment in secondary education in India, which was 74% of the population belonging to the relevant age-group, is outstripped by Malaysia (77%), Indonesia (86%), South Africa (98%) and Brazil (99%). Few universities operate at world-class levels barring a few clusters of excellence, and more skilling initiatives will be needed to bridge the gap in employability.

Robust personal income will spur discretionary consumption EIU expects personal disposable income to gradually rise beyond the levels recorded before the onset of the pandemic. India's greatest strength lies in the significant market size provided by its huge population, which generates increasing demand for consumer goods, both low-end and premium ones, as incomes rise. Household consumption expenditure will rise by about 8% per year between 2023 and 2027. However, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain low, while substantial income disparity and different consumption patterns between rural and urban regions will persist. Rural regions, which house over half of the population, will continue to spend more on food and essential items. Discretionary consumption will rise in urban areas, given a growing aspirational middle-class and a desire to purchase premium products and services. The rapid growth in personal incomes combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies seeking to capture this market. The levels of opportunity for retail businesses will remain stronger in the west and the south of the country, where income levels are higher compared to the east and the north. By 2030, upper-middle-income and high-income households will be expected to drive 60% of Indian consumption, from 37% in 2019.
Opportunities for e-commerce will grow rapidly with the growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Retail purchases will grow at an accelerated pace in metropolitan and top-tier cities, which will be significantly richer than other cities by the end of this decade. Lower-tier cities and rural areas will remain largely untapped markets, although even these will see significant e-commerce growth by 2027. As internet and logistics availability rises, e-commerce will claim more of the country's consumer market, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms, who are positioning themselves to take advantage of this trend. Nevertheless, regulation will provide some obstacles to their competitive capacity. The administration has imposed strict restrictions on retail-related e-commerce businesses to protect the interests of small brick-and-mortar businesses. However, foreign companies see these measures as discriminatory, and the government will come under pressure to revise them in 2023-27.
Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty, especially to high-end brands, than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians, price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address affordability by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice serves as a way to develop brand loyalty among new consumers.

While food constitutes by far the largest category of consumer expenditure, spending on food as a percentage of income will consistently fall in 2023-27, as rising incomes spur discretionary purchases. Spending on travel, recreation, transport, hospitality, household goods, education and vehicles will increase across urban regions. With incomes in developed rural towns catching up with those in small towns and greater internet penetration narrowing digital divides, opportunities for rural consumers will rise as issues of poor infrastructure, access to organised retail and financial inclusion improve.
Regional and cultural divergences will drive different consumption trends Several factors other than income must be weighed carefully when assessing prospects in the Indian market. First, purchasing power is as location-specific as it is income-sensitive. Second, cultural factors matter to a significant degree. Third, Indian consumers, including those who are moving up the income scale, are highly price-conscious. Fourth, it is important to note that there is hardly a single consumer characteristic that applies across the entire country. India is a collection of widely varying markets, necessitating region-specific strategies. The steady expansion of consumer finance options will increase the willingness of consumers to purchase in the forecast period.

Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state-directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reform and market liberalisation. Since then, India's GDP has expanded rapidly, with annual real GDP growth averaging 6% in fiscal years 1991/92-2022/23 (April-March). However, India's share of world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains low, at about 4% in 2022, compared with its 19% share of the world's population. This highlights significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for low incomes. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries such as information technology (IT) is vast. Corruption is still endemic in local authorities, despite the fact that attempts to reduce graft have made progress at the higher levels of government under the Bharatiya Janata Party (which has led the ruling coalition since 2014). Transfers of power are clearly established under democratic protocols. India's courts have long suffered from crippling understaffing, and a case backlog has built up over decades; the judiciary remains largely independent.
Automation will dampen employment opportunities to a certain extent Demographic trends: India's population growth will continue to decelerate over the next two decades, but EIU expects demand in India's labour market to be sufficiently met as the issue of underemployment is addressed gradually and educational attainment improves. In the next decade, we expect the working-age population to grow by 1% per year on average, supporting India's economic expansion over 2023-50. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will still not find employment in productive formal-sector jobs. A mismatch between the skill level of the country's workers and the demand for highly educated staff from employers will persist for at least the next two decades, as the quality of education provided by the government (on which a large portion of the population depends) and vocational training systems remain underdeveloped. Meanwhile, the rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will dampen employment gains, even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of global manufacturing. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove difficult in this environment. Still, opportunities for better-educated Indians will proliferate amid rapid growth in professional services, manufacturing and high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharmaceuticals. After a period of stabilisation, the pivot to a falling working-age population will not occur before 2050.
Persistent rural to urban migration will pressure infrastructure and resources Divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. In the absence of major improvements in governance, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be a source of internal migrants, putting pressure on scarce resources in more prosperous and economically dynamic cities such as the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai. Fertility rates dropped below two (the replacement level) in 2021 for all states but five in India, according to the National Family Health Survey. Therefore, population growth will slow, gradually alleviating pressure on scarce resources, although this will only happen over the next two decades. Significant levels of internal migration will be a source of social tensions. Meanwhile, workers will continue to look abroad for economic opportunities, with lower-skilled workers preferring the Gulf region, while skilled workers will migrate to the US (however, visa norms will get tighter) and Canada. The migration of skilled workers will cause a "brain drain" that hampers the growth of India's high-technology sectors.
India's strategic power will grow consistently, wielding regional influence External conditions: As the fifth-largest economy globally, and given its high growth rates, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. India's presidency of the G20 in 2023 will serve as an important opportunity to bolster its leadership credentials. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and to strengthen ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival, and China, with which India shares a border dispute. We expect India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences, especially on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. However, India's GDP far outstrips Pakistan's and the growth differential will remain high, while India's military advantage over its rival will also increase. Pakistan will refrain from initiating overt conflict, and continue to resort to terrorism attacks against India, which will provoke a strong covert or overt military response from India. China's presence in South Asia (especially in Pakistan) will push India towards adopting a more defensive posture to shield its domestic market from China, for instance, maintaining restrictions on Chinese-origin foreign direct investment, while also upping its defence infrastructure and arsenal along shared borders. Shared strategic and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific will bind India more closely to the members of the Quad (an informal diplomatic grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India). India will also develop deeper ties with France, the UAE and Canada based on defence, trade and migration priorities. Despite these strengthening ties, we do not believe that India will formally align itself with the US; it will retain a degree of independence in foreign policy to allow manoeuvring space for its domestic considerations. The importance of China-inclusive blocs like the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, will gradually wane in India's international agenda. Even as it engages more with the West, India will balance its traditionally strong relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment, and in recent years, crude oil, but the relationship will weaken over time. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement in these regions over the period to 2050. India will share strong bilateral strategic and economic relations with most nations.
States in the west and south will perform better on all parameters Institutions and policy trends: Political power will be centralised under the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the 2020s, although regional parties will emerge as dominant players in the policy space, especially on matters over which states have the final say in legislation. Growth will accelerate in reform-minded states, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to balance economic disparities. Despite state-level differences, India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will generally remain impartial (but slow) and the constitution will be respected. Pledged reforms on labour law, land acquisition and agricultural reforms will make progress. India's integration into regional and global value chains will nonetheless be constrained by a lingering tendency towards protectionism. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft, particularly at the local level.
Technology adoption and reforms will keep the growth trajectory robust Long-term performance: We forecast that India's real GDP growth will average 5.3% per year in 2023-50. The country's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment. Improvements in the adoption of technology and greater supply-chain efficiency in the agricultural sector will make rural India more resilient to climate change. However, the shift of the workforce from rural labour into more productive urban jobs will remain the leading driver of India's economic expansion. Many companies have become wary of supply-chain overreliance on China and India is increasingly well-placed to capitalise on these trends. In the long term India is the only single market that offers a potential scale comparable to that of China. Intrinsic capabilities including solid economic fundamentals, a sound digital infrastructure and favourable demographics will encourage major manufacturing investment. Upgrading the quality of public education and infrastructure will be crucial if the government is to achieve this successfully. We expect gradual progress on this front. A gradual improvement in the quality of education and vocational training will also lay the groundwork for the development of the higher-value-added sectors that will be necessary to sustain the country's growth momentum in the longer term. India's reluctance to sign multilateral trade deals will remain a major competitive disadvantage. Protectionist concerns over the impact of larger trade deals on employment and the competitiveness of locally produced goods will persist. Low levels of literacy and technical skills are a further constraint. The economy will therefore expand at a slower pace than its long-term growth potential.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability India will be highly vulnerable to climate change, and adverse changes in monsoon patterns could severely affect its agricultural sector, which remains greatly dependent on monsoon rain. More generally, water scarcity will become a challenge. Intermittent flooding episodes are also prevalent. The government has taken steps to manage the effects of climate change. However, securing the required finance will remain the largest impediment to adapt to climate change, which could cost India more than Rs85trn (US$1.1trn) by 2030 alone, with further financing requirements in the years ahead. India's energy demand will continue to grow, making it difficult to move away completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Additionally, transitioning away from a coal-based economy will be very gradual, given the sheer numbers dependent on the coal economy as a source of livelihood.
Under the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, India has made continuous strides in bolstering its renewable energy credentials. This includes the National Hydrogen Mission that was launched in 2021 (which aims to make India a green hydrogen hub), 20% ethanol blending with petrol by 2025 (from 10% currently), and a nationwide charging network for electric vehicles (which is under way). India also aims to expand its nuclear power capacity by at least threefold in the next decade. In November 2021 the prime minister, Narendra Modi, set a target for India to become a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2070. The installed renewable energy capacity has risen to 176.5 GW in June 2023 from 119.5 GW in December 2018. India is one of the founding members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which promotes the transition to solar energy. India will use the platform to leverage funding from developed nations and multilateral agencies to develop its own solar farm sector.
The country has also been making strides in developing wind energy. The National Institute for Wind Energy has estimated India's wind-power potential at 302 GW. In 2019 EIU developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Indian economy will be 3.6% smaller in 2050 than it would have been otherwise without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation India will continue to experience an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities for better-paid jobs. Social policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will increasingly have to tilt towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, inadequate urban infrastructure and declining sustainability in urban centres. The construction of urban mass-transit systems will increase, along with other urban infrastructure such as roads, sanitation and power grids. However, the enormous scale of these challenges will temper the pace of progress. The biggest challenge for policymakers will be training the workforce of rural migrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agriculture sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry. Meanwhile, emigration to Western countries, as well as to the prosperous states of the Gulf, such as the UAE, will remain strong. As a consequence, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Thaksin was a populist leader, and his political standing created a divide between the rural population, particularly in the north-eastern provinces, and their urban counterparts. Since the late 2010s a new divide has emerged between the pro-democracy young generation, which supports the left-leaning Move Forward Party (MFP), and the pro-establishment older generation, which supports the military-aligned parties and other (more politically moderate) parties.

Full text: - Political volatility will increase after the election on May 14th and the failure of the Move Forward Party (MFP)-which won the highest number of seats in the lower house of parliament-to form a government, owing to its insistence on amending Thailand's lese-majesty law. Tension between reformists and the establishment will persist throughout 2023-27 and will be a destabilising factor facing the new coalition government led by the Pheu Thai Party (PTP). EIU expects young MFP supporters to launch protests, but this will not undermine government effectiveness significantly. There is a low risk of a military coup if the new government pushes for radical reform that is deemed unacceptable to the military. The power of the royalist-military establishment will be diluted, but the establishment will still maintain its considerable influence on Thai politics.

- Thailand's business environment score improves in 2023-27, pushing up its global ranking to 35th, from 39th in 2018-22. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The higher overall score reflects improvement in a number of subcategories. Thailand's score for technological readiness will improve as the government expands e-government services and as the digitalisation of the private sector continues, including via widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. We also expect an improvement in the market opportunities category as household incomes enjoy steady growth during our forecast period, following policies aimed at encouraging faster wage growth and enhancing the welfare system. An anticipated acceleration of projects will also boost Thailand's scores for infrastructure.

- We expect Thailand's real GDP to expand by an average of 3.4% per year in 2023-27. The economy will recover to its pre-pandemic level in 2023. The growth rate will be moderately slower than before the pandemic, partly owing to lingering political uncertainty, which will dampen investment sentiment. Growth will be driven increasingly by household spending as the incoming government pursues more populist policies. Investment growth will be mild, by contrast, and held back by anxieties over the political situation. The tourism sector will return to pre-pandemic levels only in 2024-25, as visitors from China will return only gradually to Thailand.

- Population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families. Improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to longer life expectancies, but this will put a burden on healthcare provision. Migrant labour from Cambodia, Laos and-especially-Myanmar will grow in absolute terms after the lifting of pandemic-related travel restrictions in 2022, but the overall labour force is still expected to grow at a slower rate during the forecast period than in 2018-22. Foreign workers will play a more prominent role in Thailand's labour market, as the trend of a declining domestic workforce persists amid a marked increase in the elderly population in comparison with the country's peers.

However, household debt will continue to dampen consumer sentiment in the forecast period. The expansion of e-commerce and digital payments will change consumers' habits and create new market opportunities, particularly in rural areas.

- Thailand's governments in the next ten years will prove capable of enacting structural reform and upgrading infrastructure. There will be persistent challenges owing to bureaucratic red tape, political uncertainty and a tourism-oriented economy. Without such reforms, Thailand's growth will consistently fall well below its potential and lag behind regional neighbours. In later decades, Thailand's unfavourable demographic profile and the impact of climate change will also affect GDP growth and political stability.

Background: Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Although the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent and the country has subsequently been subject to 19 coups. The latest took place in 2014, when a democratically elected government led by Yingluck Shinawatra was removed. Another elected prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra (Yingluck's older brother), had previously been removed in a coup in 2006. Thaksin was a populist leader, and his political standing created a divide between the rural population, particularly in the north-eastern provinces, and their urban counterparts. Since the late 2010s a new divide has emerged between the pro-democracy young generation, which supports the left-leaning Move Forward Party (MFP), and the pro-establishment older generation, which supports the military-aligned parties and other (more politically moderate) parties.
Political structure: Following the recent transition from junta administration to nominally civilian government, parliament takes the form of a bicameral National Assembly, consisting of an elected 500-seat House of Representatives (the lower house) and a 250-seat Senate (the upper house) appointed by the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) in 2018. A new set of senators will assume office after May 2024 through a selection process. The prime minister is appointed by the National Assembly, and King Maha Vajiralongkorn remains the symbolic head of state.
Policy issues: The incoming government will stimulate economic growth more aggressively through measures to increase disposable income. It will also focus increasingly on improving the investment environment, which will accelerate planned infrastructure upgrades and improve digitalisation and technological adoption. This emphasis on long-term policy competitiveness should reassure many foreign investors who have been deterred by potential political instability, but growing regional competition will remain a challenge for Thailand in the regional race for foreign direct investment (FDI).
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stock market. Value-added tax (VAT) stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$145,800). One-off waivers and the deferral of tax payments introduced during the pandemic have been phased out.
Foreign trade: Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (balance-of-payment basis) of US$10.8bn in 2022, narrowing sharply from US$32.4bn in 2021. However, a deficit on the services account resulted in an overall current-account deficit of US$17.2bn, compared with a deficit of US$10.6bn in 2021.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The general election held in May 2023 led to triumph for Thailand's opposition parties. This will herald a change of coalition government from the military-aligned Phalang Pracharat (PP) to a new administration led by the former opposition Pheu Thai Party (PTP). Although the pro-reform and left-leaning Move Forward Party (MFP) won the highest number of seats in the lower house of parliament, its failure to secure parliamentary endorsement for its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, reflects both the remaining influence of the political establishment and the difficulty of amending Thailand's lese-majesty laws (a key MFP platform). The legislature comprises a 250-seat Senate (upper house), appointed by the military and endorsed by the king, and a 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house), elected democratically. A new set of senators will take office after May 2024, selected by various professional and interest groups. The new government will seek democratic amendments to Thailand's constitution, including by allowing for the popular election of the Senate, but we do not expect the PTP to propose changes to the lese-majesty law. We expect the royal-military establishment to lose influence in 2023-27, but it will still wield considerable power over the coalition government, owing to the fact that the PTP will seek the support from the military and senators for its government. The party's cautious reform agenda will help reduce but not fully eliminate the risk of another coup.
Despite challenges from increasingly vocal reformists, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who was formally crowned in May 2019, will oversee stability in the monarchy, owing to the lack of a broad societal consensus on reform. The military establishment will continue to look to (and defend) the monarchy to legitimise its own political role. While we expect the reformists' calls to lead to some minor adjustments to the lese-majesty law in the medium term, the monarchy will remain an influential institution for Thailand throughout the foreseeable future.

Political outlook: Political stability The MFP and the PTP, both former opposition forces, prevailed in the general election that was held on May 14th 2023, in first and second position respectively. The election outcome clearly reflected the electorate's desire for change from a military-aligned government and an amendment to the constitution to make parliament more democratic. However, the MFP's prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, failed to secure the required number of votes (375) for parliamentary endorsement, owing primarily to a lack of support from junta-appointed senators, who dominate the upper house of the legislature. The MFP's election pledge to reform the monarchy, through the amendment of the lese-majesty law (Article 112 of the criminal code), is the main factor preventing Thailand's establishment political forces from supporting Pita's candidacy.
In addition, the Constitutional Court suspended Pita from his parliamentary duties on July 19th following charges by the Election Commission that he owns shares in a media company (which is illegal under Thai electoral laws). Pita and the MFP face another serious charge that their campaign to amend the lese-majesty law is tantamount to an attempt to overthrow the constitutional monarchy system of government. This could lead to the party's dissolution and the barring of its leaders from politics.
The PTP has taken over efforts to form the next coalition government. Parliament will meet again in August for a third round of voting to elect the new prime minister. EIU's baseline scenario expects the PTP's new coalition to include parties from the current ruling bloc, including the Bhum Jai Thai Party (BJP) and, possibly, the military-aligned PP. Although the PTP's de facto leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, has patchy relations with the army, factions in the Senate will be more willing to back the PTP's prime ministerial candidate (a property tycoon, Srettha Thavisin), given the party's more accommodating stance on reform of the monarchy and army.
The MFP's failure to form the next government will lead to protests by its supporters. If the party were dissolved, demonstrations could grow and disrupt business operations. However, we believe that security forces will employ strict measures to keep these in check, and the protests will not lead to political instability. Furthermore, the party's backers are mostly young and have indicated that they will endeavour to come back stronger at the next election.
The new opposition-led government will be installed by late August, and we expect it to tilt policy in a more populist, democratic-leaning direction. The new coalition will introduce some democratic reforms that do not explicitly challenge the royal-military establishment. These will include amendments requiring the Senate to be elected rather than appointed, in order to reduce the army's role in politics.
There is a low risk that the coups that have characterised Thailand's modern political history will return during our forecast period. The military will consequently continue to exercise some influence over the coalition, while the PTP's poor track record on governance and corruption will invite closer scrutiny by civil society. Nevertheless, we assume that the PTP will be more cautious in pursuing better accommodation with the military.
The localised insurgency in Thailand's three Muslim-majority southern provinces will continue, in the form of small-scale attacks on security forces. However, this does not pose a risk to sovereignty, and represents a minimal threat to overall political stability.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness will undergo changes because of the new government's intention to amend the constitution that was drafted by the junta in 2017. The PTP campaigned on a platform to reduce the military's role in government and to introduce greater democratic forces to parliamentary institutions, including the direct election of senators. However, it will struggle to achieve these goals in practice.
Our pessimistic outlook for reform reflects the reality that the PTP needs support from the military establishment to ensure the coalition's stability, as well as to prevent another coup. This will lead to the dilution of its reform agenda (or other compromises). Nevertheless, we expect Thailand's political institutions to become moderately more democratic, with government effectiveness improving when benchmarked against the 2018-22 period. The bureaucracy will continue to pursue conservative policy to preserve economic stability, as it has done over previous decades, amid several periods of political turmoil. This will support the day-to-day functioning of government despite heightened political tension. The legal system's handling of commercial cases remains mostly effective and reliable, despite past incidents of political interference (which have since declined). Commercial law is transparent and fair.
Governmental effectiveness will nonetheless be challenged by the dynamics of the PTP's coalition government, which will continually be subject to competing vested interests between different parties. This will be a source of political anxiety and government instability throughout the forecast period.
Political outlook: Election watch The legislative election on May 14th resulted in the opposition MFP (151) and PTP (141) taking a majority of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives (the lower house of parliament). Key parties in the previous ruling bloc, namely the BJP, PP, the United Thai Nation Party, the Democrat Party (DP) and Chart Thai Pattana trailed behind, cumulatively commanding only 182 seats. The outcome showed the emergence of a younger generation of voters, who propelled the MFP to a surprise victory, as a force to be reckoned with.
Although the PTP failed to clinch first place in a general election for the first time in more than 20 years, it is still popular in Thailand's rural north and north-east. However, the PTP's likely inclusion of military-aligned parties in its future coalition government will probably dampen its popularity among its "redshirt" supporters, who have fought bitterly to remove military influence from politics. The party's electoral prospects would be significantly dimmer without the support of this group.
The strong showing of the third-placed BJP, an establishment party with a moderate platform (pro-business and liberal social policy), suggests that the party will perform well in subsequent elections. The poor showing of the DP, which was among the top three in past elections, will lead to internal reform to promote younger leadership. We expect the popularity of military-aligned parties to decline in future elections. The next general election is due in May 2027.
Political outlook: International relations Thailand's ties with Western governments have warmed since the country's partial return to democracy following the 2019 election. Trade negotiations with the EU resumed in March 2023 and may conclude by 2024. However, the blocking of the MFP's prime ministerial candidate has reignited criticism of the quality of Thailand's democratic institutions. This could complicate Thailand's relations with the West in 2023-24.
Nevertheless, Thailand will remain engaged with the US and China, both of which recognise the country's geostrategic significance in the heart of South-east Asia. This will probably temper US criticism of Thailand's democratic processes, and will prevent the imposition of trade or other punitive measures on the Thai government on the basis of concerns over democratic institutions.
China's influence in Thailand will remain strong. With the countries lacking any conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea, economic ties are set to strengthen. Thailand will continue to welcome Chinese investment into the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC, a large special economic zone south-east of the capital, Bangkok).
Thailand will also deepen its economic engagement with Japan and fellow member states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). We do not expect the incoming PTP-led government to undertake measures such as economic sanctions against Myanmar.

Overview: Thailand's overall score improves in 2023-27, reflecting its economic recovery after the pandemic and the expected return of real GDP to pre-pandemic level by 2023. The government will prioritise improving the country's economic competitiveness. Thailand will continue to benefit from higher foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows because of a shift in multinational companies' strategies aimed at reducing their dependence on China. This will be helped by the country's open capital account and a stable currency, reflecting the stability agenda in the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank). Higher public debt-a legacy of extra spending during the pandemic-will tighten fiscal space. Elevated household debts will remain a source of vulnerability for the banking sector's stability.
Strengths: The score for market opportunities improves as GDP growth returns to a steady 3-4% range, supporting the spending power of households. A rise in the score for technological readiness reflects the expansion of government e-services, which in turn will facilitate the digitalisation of the business sector. Higher scores for infrastructure and policy towards foreign investment reflect the continuing pursuit of the Thailand 4.0 blueprint to develop the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), as well as improvements in competition policy and intellectual property right protection.
Weaknesses: Market distortion will persist in some sectors as the government retains subsidies to keep price increases in check, especially for food staples. High levels of household debt will cap stronger private consumption prospects and pose a risk to banking sector stability. Tighter post-pandemic fiscal space will limit the state's ability for capital investment. A drop in the score for political stability is attributable to intensifying tensions between Thailand's reformists and the conservative establishment, raising the risks of protests.
What to watch
- Political friction between the pro-reform and the establishment camps will persist. Constitutional cases against the Move Forward Party (MFP) and its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, will merit close attention in the near term.
- The incoming government will push for amendments to the current constitution. The process will be highly politicised. The prospect of political stability hinges upon the new government's ability to deliver reforms deemed acceptable to its core supporters without pushing the military to take drastic actions, such as staging another coup.

Business environment outlook: Thailand's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: The authorities support small and medium-sized enterprises by expanding technology grants and improving private access to finance. However, they pursue only modest reform of state-owned enterprises.
2025-27: Thailand improves its domestic enforcement regime for intellectual property rights (IPR), which leads to the country's removal from the US Trade Representative's IPR watchlist.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: The authorities introduce new incentives to promote inward investment in targeted industries, especially those that promote innovation in the manufacturing processes, and in the green and renewable energy industries.
2025-27: Legislation on foreign land ownership, which was halted in November 2022, is passed.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Thailand completes free-trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with the UAE and Sri Lanka, and launches its application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
2025-27: Thailand completes FTA negotiations with the EU and the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA).
Taxes 2023-24: The Board of Investment introduces measures to mitigate the impact on the private sector of the OECD's scheme to combat tax base erosion and profit shifting.
2025-27: The government raises the rate of value-added tax (VAT) slightly from its current level of 7%, but exempts cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Digitalisation of the tax ecosystem is carried out.
Financing 2023-24: The Stock Exchange of Thailand tightens listing and governance regulations to bolster investors' confidence.
2025-27: The authorities introduce comprehensive regulations governing sustainable finance for more sectors.
The labour market 2023-24: The government encourages faster wage increases and relaxes rules on the hiring of migrant workers.
2025-27: Shortages of skilled labour become more acute, driving up costs in high-value-added industries. The law is relaxed to raise the labour participation rate among women and older workers.
Infrastructure 2023-24: The expansion of utilities, road and rail infrastructure progresses, providing a boost to the construction sector.
2025-27: Most infrastructure development projects under the Eastern Economic Corridor scheme are completed.

Overview: Improvements in Thailand's macroeconomic environment score push up the country's ranking globally (to fifth, from 13th in 2018-22) and regionally (to first, from third). Economic growth will reach 3.2% in 2023, owing to strong private consumption growth and recovery in the tourism sector. The BOT will preserve prudent policy, which will keep inflation in check amid more populist fiscal policy from the incoming government. Although the country will benefit from increasing inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) as foreign investors de-risk from China, the manufacturing sector will face challenges from a scarcity of skilled workers. Public-sector debt will stay above 60% of GDP in the forecast period, owing to higher expenditure associated with expanded welfare provision.
Strengths: The BOT will uphold its traditional credibility and remain free from political pressure. It will balance the objectives of supporting economic recovery while preserving financial stability. Growth will be supported by resilient consumption, tourism and moderate investment during 2023-27.
Weaknesses: High household debt, currently above 90% of GDP, pose risks to financial stability. More expansionary fiscal policy introduced by the incoming government will delay fiscal consolidation. A less stable coalition government will dent business and household confidence and constrain growth prospects.
What to watch
- A divergence of political views under the new coalition risks sparking policy confusion. This will constrain stronger macroeconomic prospects in the medium term and may risk pushing Thailand's rankings lower in the coming years.
- We expect the new government to preserve the main crux of the Thailand 4.0 blueprint and Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) project, as well as the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model espoused by the outgoing military-aligned government. These initiatives may be rebranded, however, and some of the contract terms may be tweaked.

Overview: The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition in 2023-27 improves from the 2018-22 period. Thailand's global ranking improves from 32nd to 30th, although its regional ranking remains unchanged. Most (but not all) price controls from the pandemic era have been lifted. The new government will improve the competitiveness of small firms by expanding technology grants and improving their access to finance. However, big business groups with ties to the political elite will retain disproportionate influence on commercial affairs. The restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be gradual and will not threaten their incumbencies.
Strengths: Further policy measures are likely to help small and medium-sized businesses to realise their growth potential. The country's accession to the Copyright Treaty of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in October 2022 and the Copyrights Act enacted in August 2022 will improve the domestic intellectual property ecosystem.
Weaknesses: A minority of price controls will be maintained to alleviate hardship facing lower-income groups; this will continue to cause some market distortion. Some sectors will remain dominated by big players; these include telecommunications, especially after the merger of True Corporation and Total Access Communication in March 2023. Efforts towards the reform and privatisation of SOEs in the utilities and energy sectors will make only limited progress.
What to watch
- Fair competition regulations will expand to cover the digital sector. The government is more vigilant on anti-competitive conduct by platform operators and online gatekeepers, and may coin new regulations modelled on the EU's Digital Markets Act. The Trade Competition Commission of Thailand is looking to clarify rules on merger controls.
- The Central Intellectual Property and International Trade Court will implement the new Rules for Intellectual Property and International Trade Cases in the latter part of 2023.
- The extension of price controls on 51 goods and services to June 30th 2024 will continue to distort certain parts of the retail market in the short term.

Overview: The score for policy towards foreign investment improves significantly in 2023-27, leading to much improved global and regional rankings (up from 46th to 32nd and ninth to eighth respectively). Keenly aware of intense regional competition for FDI, Thailand is prioritising improvements to the country's attractiveness. The Investment Promotion Strategy (2023-28) introduced by the Board of Investment (BOI), which took effect in January 2023, will favour FDI that will spur innovation, competitiveness and sustainability. Conversely, the Foreign Business Act still restricts FDI in selected sectors, and the foreign land ownership legislation, which would open up more opportunities for foreign owners, has been stalled.
Strengths: Thai legislation explicitly offers protection to investors. The constitution prevents expropriation without unfair compensation and mandates the government to pass a specific law before undertaking any expropriation. The Investment Promotion Act of 2017 guarantees against the nationalisation of the operations and assets of BOI-promoted investors.
Weaknesses: There remain sector-specific restrictions on foreign investors. The Foreign Business Act of 1999 restricts foreign ownership in certain sectors such as banking, insurance and telecommunications. It prohibits non-Thais from investing in industries such as broadcasting, agriculture and forestry. Land ownership remains largely restricted for foreigners. Although the outgoing cabinet had approved a draft regulation on foreign land ownership, it was withdrawn in November 2022 because of a public backlash.
What to watch
- The BOI will roll out additional investment incentives as part of its Investment Promotion Strategy (2023-28). The targeted industries include biotechnology, nanotechnology and advanced materials technology.
- The EEC Office is drafting another five-year plan (2023-27) to attract private-sector investment and operations to the zone.
- The next government will decide whether or not to amend or push forward the draft regulation regarding foreign land ownership. The political climate during the first half of the forecast period is likely to remain unfavourable to relaxation.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: The score for foreign trade and exchange controls in 2023-27 remains unchanged from 2018-22, causing drops in Thailand's rakings both globally (to 33rd, from 31st in 2018-22) and regionally (to sixth, from fourth). The government will maintain its open economy and will be keen to diversify export markets and pursue free-trade agreements (FTAs). However, Thailand's number of deals and partners pales in comparison to other Asian states. Foreign-exchange regulations will be loosened to facilitate market activities, but non-tariff barriers and select exchange controls will continue to hinder the ease of doing business.
Strengths: Thailand is well connected through FTAs with Asia-Pacific countries under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), effective since January 2022, and under the umbrella of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Exchange rates are generally governed by market forces. Thailand has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends. Since 2020 the BOT has further relaxed its regulations to promote cross-border capital flows and to enhance flexibility in foreign-exchange transactions.
Weaknesses: The number of Thailand's FTAs and trading partners beyond the Asia-Pacific pales in comparison to other ASEAN countries, offering less deep overseas market opportunities for businesses exporting from Thailand as part of their supply chains. Non-tariff barriers, such as import licensing, labelling requirements and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, continue to impede trade. Foreign entities may face discrimination in the public procurement sector, given Thailand's non-participation in the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Government Procurement.
What to watch
- Thailand is negotiating six FTAs, namely with Canada, the European Union, European Free Trade Association, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Most are expected to be concluded in 2024-2025.
- The incoming government will look to apply formally to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2024-25, creating some new market opportunities in countries such as Canada and the UK.

Business environment outlook: Taxes

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: Thailand's score increases marginally in 2023-27. The country's global and regional rankings have dropped to 16th and seventh respectively, but this largely reflects stronger improvements in rival markets. The marginal increase in the score is due to the implementation of new and fairer taxation for property and land. Thailand's tax regime remains relatively simple, and changes have been made in recent years to reduce the overall burden on households and firms. However, the country's commitments under the OECD's Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty-Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI BEPS) will pose additional compliance challenges for businesses. The rise in public debt may force the government to increase taxes in 2023-27.
Strengths: Thailand's tax rates are competitive and the regime is business-friendly. The value-added tax (VAT) rate of 7% is lower than in many regional peers. A single VAT system makes tax calculations straightforward. Exporters of goods and services, as well as cryptocurrency firms, are exempted from VAT. The corporate income tax has remained at 20% on net profit since 2013. Personal income tax is also relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35%. Professionals pay a reduced personal income tax rate of 17%.
Weaknesses: Tax rates will probably be adjusted upward in the latter part of the forecast period as the government looks for ways to finance its fiscal expenditure. The government will probably increase capital gains tax for non-resident corporate entities (currently at 15%). The exemption from VAT and income tax for Thai start-ups transferring digital assets (such as digital tokens and cryptocurrencies) will end on December 31st 2023.
What to watch
- The Tax Revenue Department aims to streamline and fully digitalise the tax ecosystem by 2028. New (or revised) tax filing procedures are likely.
- The government is likely to keep the VAT rate at 7% after September 2023, but an increase is possible during 2025-27.
- The OECD's BEPS initiative will probably be enacted in 2024, raising the minimum tax rate to 15% (in line with the new OECD global standard). It will entail the withdrawal or amendment of the BOI's tax incentives. The BOI will announce additional guidelines and clarification to alleviate the impact of BEPS implementation on multinational enterprises.

Overview: Thailand's score increases in 2023-27, reflecting the banking sector's persistent resilience in the face of headwinds from its pandemic-induced recession. However, Thailand's global and regional rankings fall to 33rd and ninth respectively, largely reflecting deeper improvements in the financial systems of other economies. The banking sector dominates Thailand's financial system, but the country also has highly liquid capital markets. Financial institutions are well capitalised and the regulatory and supervisory regime is credible.
Strengths: Thailand's monetary authorities enjoy a reputation for both credibility and prudence. While the banking sector dominates the financial landscape, the capital market is deep and liquid. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and Thai Futures Exchange (TFEX) respectively have the highest and second-highest liquidity in South-east Asia. SET's Strategic Plan (2023-25) aims to broaden and deepen the capital market. Its local-currency bond market is also ASEAN's largest, and will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT, which is also spearheading the financial sector's transition towards better sustainability.
Weaknesses: Foreign investors in listed local shares still face some restrictions with regard to dividends and voting rights. Some listed firms still have limits on foreign ownership. Listing standards and governance in the SET are still lagging, as exemplified in the accounting scandals that hit several listed firms in early 2023. The banking sector has the highest level of household debts in ASEAN-a source of vulnerability and potential threat to financial stability.
What to watch
- The SET will introduce new rules in the latter part of 2023, including raising the free-float ratio and the threshold for profitability and shareholder's equities.
- The BOT and SET are co-leading the development of Thailand Taxonomy, a classification system for sustainable financing. The upcoming Phase 2 implementation will focus on the manufacturing, agriculture, property, construction and waste management sectors.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: Thailand's score remains unchanged in 2023-27, while its global and regional rankings drop to 34th and 10th respectively, reflecting its waning international competitiveness. The government has extended migrant workers' work permits from neighbouring countries, which were due to expire in 2023, until February 2025, and will further relax rules on migrant workers in order to ease ongoing labour shortages and support the operations of foreign-invested enterprises. However, rising wage costs and skill shortages will persist as structural weaknesses. Thailand's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production will vanish quickly amid growing competition from low-income neighbours such as Cambodia and Vietnam, both of which offer more competitive labour costs. To address the shortage of skilled labour, the High-skilled Workforce Development Platform for Strategic Industries was launched in October 2021 to enhance the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills of Thailand's workforce in targeted industries. The Higher Education Sandbox scheme also aims to improve the country's innovation and education. These initiatives were launched only in recent years, however, suggesting that they will fail to create sufficient high-skilled personnel in the near-term.
Strengths: The domestic labour laws are business-friendly. Less than 2% of the workforce is unionised. Seeking to redress its labour shortage, the country will continue to embrace migrant workers to fill low-skilled vacancies in agriculture, construction and domestic work. The hiring of high-skilled foreign workers will ease as the government further relaxes visa restrictions in 2023-27, especially for the research and technology sectors. The Work from Home legislation, effective since April 2023, gives employers an option to allow remote working for employees, increasing flexibility for white-collar workers.
Weaknesses: Labour costs will rise more quickly than in previous years as a result of election pledges made by all major political parties. The proportion of high-skilled workers (13.8%) is lower than those in developed nations, which will carry consequences for high-value industries, including the aspirations of the Thailand 4.0 policy. The labour shortage reflects both an aging society and an underperforming education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally. The mismatch between jobs and skills will worsen as more firms embrace increasingly advanced technology that requires more STEM graduates.
What to watch
- Future minimum-wage rises will be a tussle between the new government, looking to deliver its election campaign promises, and the private sector, which will argue that the proposed increase will not be matched by an increase in productivity.
- The government plans to reach a target of providing 800,000 skilled workers by 2024 and 12.5m by 2027.

Overview: The country's score for infrastructure improves in the forecast period. While its global ranking rises marginally from 57th to 56th in 2023-27, its regional ranking slips to 11th, because of faster improvements in other Asian economies. Thailand has country-wide 5G coverage. Infrastructure projects in the EEC have been delayed, but will proceed more rapidly in 2023-27. Upgrades at international airports are likely in the forecast period, but major high-speed rail projects will face continued obstacles, owing to disagreements with China over project details. High power tariffs will be a problem unless the next administration finds sustainable measures to redress them.
Strengths: We expect the major projects under the EEC umbrella, though delayed, to be completed in the latter part of the forecast period. This will significantly expand the country's seaport, airport, and rail networks. The Bt2.2trn (US$64.1bn) EEC Regional Infrastructure Construction Action Plan for 2023-27 also aims to galvanise the country's transport networks, including upgrades to major international airports by Airports of Thailand (a state-run management company). 5G infrastructure is currently present in all provinces, setting Thailand ahead of other Asian countries and laying the foundation for digital infrastructure. The government aims to expand 5G networks to cover 98% of the population by 2027.
Weaknesses: Delays persist in the financing and implementation stages of some infrastructure megaprojects. The construction of the Thai section of the high-speed railway linking Thailand with China via Laos remains only around 20% complete, despite six years of construction. The building of another high-speed railway connecting Don Mueang, Suvarnabhumi and U-Tapao airports has not commenced, despite pledges that it would begin in 2021. Both projects are slated to be completed in 2027, but we assign a high risk of delay. Thailand's energy costs are higher than those of neighbouring countries, undercutting firms' competitiveness. More than 70% of Thailand's electricity is generated using natural gas, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices and other external shocks. The government has yet to find a long-term, sustainable solution to its problem with high power tariffs, which reflects the need for a more competitive energy sector.
What to watch
- The new government will look to address the structural causes of high electricity prices. A joint committee may be formed to allow both the public and private sectors to discuss a new structure for electricity rates, along with related matters, such as clean energy.
- The Thailand 5G Alliance, a public-private grouping given the task of promoting next-generation applications, is devising short-term and long-term infrastructure development plans to transform the country into a regional digital hub.

Overview: Thailand's technological readiness score improves significantly in 2023-27, boosting its global ranking to 35th, even as its regional ranking remains at 10th. The change reflects our expectation that the government will expand the digital economy ecosystem. Thailand will undergo improvements in cross-border digital payments, e-government and cybersecurity during the forecast period. 5G coverage is nationwide, but the issue of "last mile" connectivity has persisted for some rural or remote areas. Challenges remain in some areas of research and development (R&D) and STEM education.
Strengths: Thailand has 5G coverage in all provinces. Efforts to implement e-government services will lower burdens to doing business. The Act on Electronic Performance of Administrative Functions, in force since October 2022, requires most government agencies (with exceptions in the legislative and judicial branches) to use electronic means to communicate with and provide services to the public. Thailand's Cybersecurity ecosystem will continue to improve. The Cybersecurity Act has been in effect since August 2019. Thailand's QR code payment system is now linked to those of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore and will expand further. The government provides incentives for R&D by firms, while the BOI allows corporate income tax exemptions for up to 13 years if firms in advanced sectors co-operate with Thai research institutions in R&D.
Weaknesses: While the 5G network is widespread in Thailand's bigger cities, remote areas still lack "last mile" connectivity. Progress on this front has been slow owing to high costs and the poor quality of existing wireless hotspots. Thailand's spending on R&D, at 1.2% of GDP, is lower than other Asian countries and is still far from the country's target of 2% GDP by 2027.
What to watch
- The BOI will provide new incentives for companies engaging in R&D.
- The government will further expand e-government services during the forecast period, including a more comprehensive digital tax platform.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The incoming government will adopt a more populist set of policies than its predecessor to fulfil election pledges. These will include strong wage growth, some form of debt holiday and better welfare benefits, as well as policies aimed at enhancing economic benefits for Thailand's rural population. However, the PTP's economic agenda is less redistributive than that of the MFP. Some of its proposed policies have also already drawn pushback from businesses, who are concerned that stronger wage growth-without better productivity-will erode their competitiveness. The PTP has since suggested that it will implement staged wage increases, pending broader economic performance, and that it would provide greater support for digitalisation and innovation to address concerns over productivity. These moves suggest that the PTP retains a degree of sensitivity to business interests and will navigate carefully to avoid antagonising the Thai corporate sector, despite its populist tilt.
The impact of the prolonged war in Ukraine and higher interest rates will discourage the next government from fully withdrawing fiscal support, lest this derail the economic recovery. This means that price controls on some essential goods will persist over 2023, to ameliorate high living costs, before being phased out in 2024.
The outgoing government's "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy, which promotes the country's transformation into a sophisticated manufacturing and technology hub, and the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model, which encourages sustainable business practices, will not be abandoned by the new government (although the PTP could rebrand them). The key objectives of all the major political parties include meeting sustainability and climate goals and promoting innovation-led manufacturing, suggesting long-term commitment to these goals.
However, Thailand's aspiration to become an innovation-driven and high-technology economy will face obstacles, owing to a deficiency in skilled labour and fierce competition from better-positioned regional peers. Conflicts with vested interests and political competition will continue to affect major public infrastructure projects, which will fall behind schedule and drag on overall economic competitiveness.

Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Government expenditure 18.0 19.8 20.2 20.6 20.9 20.9
Government revenue 15.3 17.1 17.4 17.7 17.9 17.8
Budget balance -2.7 -2.7 -2.8 -2.9 -3.0 -3.1
We forecast that the budget deficit will be stable in 2023, at the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, unchanged from 2022. Despite the withdrawal of the pandemic relief package, the maintenance of subsidies on energy goods and utilities will prevent a faster narrowing of the fiscal deficit. The government's reluctance to reduce its expenditure will lead to higher public debt, the ceiling for which, as a share of GDP, was raised from 60% to 70% in 2021. We forecast that public debt will stand at the equivalent of 61.2% of GDP in 2023, much higher than the pre-pandemic level of 41.2% of GDP in 2019. Public debt servicing will remain comfortable, given only a modest rise in domestic interest rates and the fact that most public debt is domestic, with long tenors.
We expect populist policies introduced by the new government to keep expenditure elevated. Fiscal consolidation will be delayed and the fiscal deficit will swell to an average of 3% of GDP over 2024-27. Increases in infrastructure investment will also form the bulk of rising government expenditure after 2023. An increase in the value-added tax (VAT) in the latter part of the forecast period, from the current rate of 7%, will help to bolster pubic revenue and prevent a significantly wider fiscal deficit. Public debt will stay above 60% of GDP in 2025-27.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates

Short-term interest rate (year-end) 0.5 1.0 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.1
Money market interest rate (year‑end) 0.6 1.8 2.2 1.7 1.4 1.2
We expect the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) to slow the pace of policy rate increases over the remainder of 2023. The terminal rate will probably settle at 2.5% by the end of the year, implying two more 25-basis-point increases in the second half. The BOT's concern over the impact of more expansionary fiscal policy by the next government will keep it on a tightening course in 2023.
The BOT will switch to a neutral policy stance in 2024, as GDP growth will peak in that year. Monetary easing is likely to begin in 2025, as the priority will shift back to supporting growth, given the expectation that Thailand will record tepid expansion in comparison with its peers.

We expect real GDP to grow by 3.2% in 2023. Ongoing fiscal subsidies and a continuing recovery in tourism will support jobs and household income growth, bolstering private consumption. Growth in investment will be tepid in comparison, but there will be pockets of strong activity in electric vehicles and the IT sector (the latter resulting from greater adoption of digitalisation). Exports of goods and services will be lifted by inbound tourism as visitors return (including those from China), but there will be an offsetting impact from weaker global demand for Thai goods.
We forecast that Thailand's real GDP will expand by 3.5% on average in 2024-27. Private consumption growth will be supported by the new government's policies, which will increase welfare spending and promote faster wage growth. Deceleration in inflation in 2023 and the continuation of fiscal subsidies will lend support to household spending. Tourism is expected to return fully to its pre-pandemic levels within 2024-25. Thailand will promote other subsectors within services, such as finance and logistics, as part of a strategy to diversify growth-drivers, and this will support steady expansion in the medium term.
In manufacturing, competition between the US and China will provide some tailwinds for Thailand as multinationals diversify their regional supply chains. Incentives for the production of electric vehicles will boost the competitiveness of the anchor automotive sector against emerging rivals in the region.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow by an annual average of 3.4% in 2023-27. A recovery in industrial output will be delayed until 2024, owing to sharply slowing external demand and a prolonged downturn in the global electronics cycle that will not ease until late 2023. The relocation of supply chains away from China amid ongoing US-China trade tensions will benefit Thailand, particularly in its automotive sector, where the country is already seen as a hub (its electronics sector is also poised for gains). These trends will preserve future investment into the country's electric vehicle and digital technology sectors over 2023-27. The government will also encourage greater investment into the renewable energy and agro-industry sectors, which will support their output over the forecast period.
The China de-risking strategy will increase relocation to Thailand The services sector will grow by an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-27. Tourism, which traditionally accounts for over 70% of the sector, will continue to recover in the forecast period as international travel normalises, but it will only return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024-25. This stems from the fact that China, which had been the largest source of Thailand's inbound tourism, will achieve more modest economic growth during 2023-27, which will affect Chinese travellers' behaviour. However, in the longer term, Thailand will retain its attractiveness as a major global tourist destination.
Meanwhile, the financial sector will remain relatively healthy. Although the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans is likely to remain elevated as the fallout of the pandemic lingers, the sector will be able to weather the storm with its adequate capitalisation and a competent central bank. However, household debt remains elevated, which will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2023-27. In the first quarter of 2023 household debt remained above 90% of GDP, compared to 84.9% at end-2020. Elsewhere, the telecommunications segment will record stable growth towards the end of the forecast period, as digitalisation becomes more widespread. This will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services and will dovetail with the continued expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The agriculture sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Output in 2024 will likely be moderately affected by the El Niño phenomenon. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by implementation issues and a lack of government attention, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to raise productivity by employing more sophisticated technologies. Some industries, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to Western countries' market-access requirements regarding labour rights. These weaknesses will ensure that farmers remain an important interest group for the new government. We expect the agriculture sector to grow by an annual average of 1.9% in 2023-27.

We forecast that consumer prices will increase at the much slower pace of 1.5% in 2023, compared with 6.1% in 2022. A moderation in global oil prices will be the principal factor, given Thailand's high reliance on imported fuel. Inflationary pressure will be driven increasingly by demand-pull factors as private consumption strengthens in 2023-24, supported by greater job opportunities in the service sector and improving wage growth prospects. A weather pattern, El Niño, could push up food prices in 2024, but we assess the likely overall impact on inflation to be moderate, owing to the country's ample stockpile of key crops.
In the medium term we forecast that consumer prices will rise by 2% on average in 2024-27, owing to the below-potential rate of growth, as well as the BOT's vigilant monetary policy. Conservative monetary and fiscal policies have contributed to price stability in much of the past decade.

The baht has rebounded against the US dollar since the fourth quarter of 2022, owing to a period of weakness in the US currency and the strong recovery in Thailand's tourism sector. We expect the trend to continue in the remainder of 2023, given our assumption that interest-rate increases in the US will be slower than in 2022. We forecast that the exchange rate will reach Bt34.2:US$1 by the end of 2023, slightly stronger than the Bt34.6:US$1 recorded a year earlier.
The currency's value will be influenced primarily by the current account, which will return to surplus from 2023, benefiting from the strengthening upturn in the tourism sector. During the remainder of the forecast period we expect the current-account surplus to widen nearer to its pre-pandemic levels, and this will contribute to the continued gradual strengthening of the baht in 2024, before the currency stabilises at just below Bt31:US$1 (on an annual average basis) in 2025-27.

We forecast that the current account will return to a surplus equivalent to 1.1% of GDP in 2023, after registering a deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2022. The services account will return to a small surplus in 2023, after deficits in 2020-22, in line with the recovery in the tourism sector. Thailand's exports of merchandise goods, which expanded at a reasonably strong pace in 2022, will decelerate in 2023 as demand weakens in the economies of major trading partners. Nevertheless, the country's well-diversified goods export basket, covering the electronics, automotive and agricultural sectors, will provide support for the trade account.
The current-account surplus will widen in 2024. The surplus on the goods trade account will expand modestly in 2023-24 as the effects of the surge in energy prices and supply-chain disruption dissipate. The trade surplus will continue to widen gradually in the rest of the forecast period, as increased investment activity drives import demand. The surplus on the services account will also widen following the normalisation of international travel from China from late 2024.
Thailand will continue to promote free trade and deeper regional integration. The government will focus on completing negotiations on a free-trade agreement with the EU; talks will conclude by 2024 and the deal will probably be implemented by 2024-25. In 2024 Thailand will commence talks on joining another mega-regional trade agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will conclude during the forecast period.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand Stocks and flows Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows averaged US$12.4bn during 2021-22, after a net outflow in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Thailand has been among the countries in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) that have benefited from stronger FDI inflows as multinational businesses have sought to de-risk from China. Supportive government incentives have played a role in attracting investment, but the country's pre-eminent position as an automotive production hub is also another favourable factor. Outward investment, particularly to countries within ASEAN, increased strongly in 2020-21 to around US$19bn on average, but moderated in 2022 to US$7.6bn. We expect outbound capital flows to pick up in 2023-27 as Thai investors continue to acquire overseas assets. In 2022 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$310bn, equivalent to 62.6% of GDP, while the stock of outward FDI stood at US$182.2bn.
Origin and distribution The private manufacturing sector has traditionally attracted the largest proportion of FDI into Thailand. Manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances, in particular, have attracted significant foreign interest. The financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence in recent years. Japanese firms retain their position as the main investors in Thailand, but investment from China has increased significantly. Chinese investors, at least as much as their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure development plans, but this will come in the form of vendor contracts in construction, logistics planning and technology. FDI from the EU and other ASEAN nations also increased sharply in 2021-22, probably reflecting a surge in supply-chain diversification.
Determinants Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its reasonable infrastructure, flexible labour laws and relatively friendly regulatory regime for foreign investors. Nonetheless, any sign of political instability, which remains a persistent risk, as well as growing regional competition, will pose a challenge to Thailand's attractiveness in the medium term. The Board of Investment (BOI) offers incentives, which generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including permission to bring in foreign workers, to own land and to take or remit foreign currency abroad. The Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. Thailand has generally been regarded as one of the most open economies in the region to foreign investment. The BOI's investment promotion strategy has continued to extend incentives to newer industries, such as alternative energy and environmental services, as well as hospitality and wellness, along with infrastructure (primarily via a number of big-ticket projects). The BOI has removed some previous FDI incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries, but it has also expedited the investment application and approval process more generally in recent years, and is likely to retain this as a priority as regional competition for FDI intensifies. Disagreements from lawmakers (and sometimes within the governing coalition) are not a major risk to most FDI projects. These tensions will, however, slow the pace of decision-making on investment related to expensive infrastructure megaprojects.
Impact Steady FDI inflows have long helped to support overall economic growth. These dynamics have contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pick-up trucks), electronics (especially computer parts) and electrical appliances. Reliance on FDI for financing major economic initiatives has nonetheless compounded the economy's already significant exposure to external conditions.
Potential Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of being a leading economy in the region with an open regulatory regime, but there is a growing risk that other regional economies will close the gap on its business environment. The political outlook following the general election in 2023 paints a picture of persistent tension between Thailand's reformists and its conservative establishment. This could manifest in occasional protests by the supporters of the left-leaning Move Forward Party (MFP). While we retain a benign outlook for political stability in 2023-27, the volatile nature of Thai politics remains a key business risk. The new coalition government will not be as stable as its outgoing military-aligned predecessor, and there is a (low) risk of another military coup sometime over the forecast period. Political uncertainty will cloud the country's investment environment, but FDI flows will not be severely disrupted, as indicated by past episodes of domestic political turmoil. The continued implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership should also enhance the kingdom's attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment, although a number of structural challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has diminished owing to its rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and less strong domestic demand compared with other markets in South-east Asia. Although the new government is committed to further economic and policy liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to strategic sectors such as telecommunications, media and utilities remains difficult. The standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, but it remains inferior to Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location, while poorer competitors such as Vietnam and Indonesia are catching up. The government's acceleration of its infrastructure development programme will rectify this shortfall, but only to a degree.

Family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate low, at 0.1% per year in the forecast period (2023-27). By 2027 the population is forecast to reach 72m, with females accounting for slightly more than half of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 6.2 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 6.7 per 1,000 in 2018-22. Life expectancy will also continue to edge upwards, despite the temporary impact of the covid-19 pandemic, with men expected to live for an average of 76.3 years in 2023-27, up from 74.8 in 2018-22; female life expectancy will rise from 83.4 years to 84.4 years over the same period.
Demographic ageing and a smaller workforce will add strains on the budget Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion aged under 15 edging down since 2011. Meanwhile, the proportion aged over 65 is set to grow to 17.2% in 2027, from 13.8% in 2022. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio will remain relative low at 0.23 in 2027, from 0.24 in 2017, and the old-age dependency ratio will rise from 0.16 to 0.25 over the same period. This demographic trend will place further strain on healthcare and pension provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme that was introduced in 2001 and has been free for all citizens since 2006. EIU expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period. It will, nonetheless, face growing burdens as a result of the country's ageing population, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and the country's poor air quality.
Fatality and health issues from worsening air pollution will increase. The crude death rate is forecast at 8.3 per 1,000 in 2023-27. Non-com-municable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases (but not including covid-19) are traditionally responsible for around 75% of all deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO also reported in 2019 that the rate of road traffic fatalities in Thailand is among the ten highest in the world. Deteriorating air quality-pollution levels in Bangkok (the capital) and northern provinces have hit record highs in recent years-also poses a threat of increased premature death and health burdens. Thailand has, however, made progress in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which was a leading cause of death in the country during the early 2000s. The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that the mortality ratio has declined to 0.69 in 2022, and that the number of people living with the disease remained stable at 560,000 in 2022. Other infectious diseases, such as cholera, measles and mumps, have become less common but have not been eradicated.
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, and shortages of skilled labour will intensify in the next five years. The working-age population will contract slowly, dropping to 48.6m by 2027, from 50.7m in 2017, owing to a decline in the birth rate in recent decades. This will preserve slow growth in the labour force in 2023-27, which will expand from 39.9m in 2022 to just 41.4m in 2027. This will make Thailand dependent on migrant labour from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, particularly with regards to unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees.
Urbanisation will remain a significant demographic trend. Despite slow population growth and a reduction in average household size, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period. Internal migration and changing social patterns have made it increasingly common for households to consist only of nuclear (rather than extended) families. Although the capital, Bangkok, remains the main focus for the urban population, other cities, including Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Surat Thani, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. The share of rural population has declined slowly over the years, but remained at 47% in 2022, according to the World Bank, which is still quite high by the standards of middle-income countries. This means that further expansion of cities amid increasing urbanisation will continue to feature as a prominent demographic theme in the forecast period.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market, with a population of 71.7m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$495.7bn at market exchange rates in 2022. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that goods exported from Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's market of 600m people, including a middle class with growing disposable income. The implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership from 2022 will further expand the regional reach of Thailand's goods and services.
EIU forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will rise steadily throughout the forecast period, after the pandemic and loss of tourism receipts interrupted its upward trajectory in 2020-22. The strengthening economic recovery, during which GDP growth will average 3.4% over 2023-27, will support the job market and household income. Furthermore, the new government's policy to encourage faster wage growth and expand welfare provision will keep a floor under growing personal disposable incomes in the coming five years. Purchasing power will be uneven, however, reflecting the substantial wealth disparity between urban and rural areas.
High household debt will constrain growth in consumption in 2022-26 Household spending will be tempered by high personal debt, which has increased substantially in the past decade. In particular, the debt burden among lower income groups will significantly dampen their consumer demand and limit their prospects for social mobility. This will particularly affect the share available for spending on consumer goods, ensuring that Thailand's retail goods market experiences relatively low growth compared with its neighbours.

On average, retail sales volumes will grow by 4.6% in 2023-27, which is markedly faster than in 2018-22. Owing to elevated (albeit moderating) food and energy prices, the government will maintain price controls and subsidies on select items, to relieve cost-of-living burdens for Thailand's low-income and unemployed citizens. The value-added tax (VAT) rate is likely to be maintained at the current level of 7% until 2024. The government will finance these subsidies by running a budget deficit, which we expect to rise towards 3% of GDP by 2026-27 (from 2.7% of GDP in 2022). However, medium-term goals for fiscal consolidation imply that VAT rates will be raised in the later part of the forecast period. Meanwhile, higher "sin taxes" on sugar, alcohol and tobacco will have a minor impact on the consumption pattern of the population at large.
Discretionary spending will be notably higher at the end of the forecast period Consumer expenditure on essential items such as food, household goods and clothing will fall gradually as a proportion of total expenditure throughout the forecast period. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants will resume strong and steady growth from 2022 as cross-border travel normalises. Tourist numbers will firm gradually from 2023, but the return of inbound arrivals to pre-pandemic levels is unlikely until 2024-25, owing to an expected slow return by Chinese travellers. Discretionary expenditure, such as on leisure, will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. We forecast that healthcare spending will increase steadily in absolute terms in 2023-27, as the population ages. The fluctuation in spending on transport and communications will partially reflect movement in global energy prices, and access to the internet will become more affordable during the forecast period.

Initial conditions: The past two decades have been characterised by political turmoil, with coups in 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, with Thailand often underperforming its regional peers, owing to both natural disasters and political crises. Physical infrastructure, though adequate, needs to be upgraded. Reform of the education system has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the quality of teaching or the curriculum. The workforce is therefore characterised by a low level of technical skills-a problem made worse by rapid demographic ageing.
Demographic trends: Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the ageing population. Although the female labour force participation rate will have risen by 2030, this will not prevent an average annual contraction of around 0.6% in the wider labour force over 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation concerning immigrants' right to work, especially in skilled positions, will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immigration and long-term visa policies further, owing to the country's negative demographic profile. The effectiveness of this could be limited by domestic political concerns over immigration, in connection with rising ethnic tensions and anti-immigration sentiment.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. The primary issue will be US-China tensions, which we expect to intensify in the coming decades. Worsening economic and geopolitical anxieties will pose a dilemma for Thailand, which risks becoming caught in the crossfire; US efforts to deny Chinese access to certain advanced semiconductors, for example, may complicate production activity in Thailand's automotive and electronic industries (which rely largely on Chinese inputs). Beyond that, Thailand currently enjoys strong relations with both China and the US, and will remain reluctant to choose a sides.
Consequently, we expect Thailand to pursue a neutral policy that engages with both China and the US in ways that both expand engagement and minimise potential conflict. In its relations with the West-and the US more specifically-Thailand will deepen its participation in Western-led trade initiatives, including the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. To hedge its risks, Thailand will also conclude an free-trade agreement with the EU and formally apply to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, as part of efforts to diversify its reliance on US trade links.
Thailand's relationship with China will also be characterised by closer integration, which could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China and South-east Asia, meeting China's increasing demand for foreign holidays, region-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. The government is already spearheading a move in that direction under its "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy and, in part, via its Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone. This is particularly the case for the tourism sector, and the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way towards supporting these aims. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so.
The development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC), formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand to the degree that the country retains its prominence in the region. Nevertheless, although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China over the remainder of the 2020s, Thailand will still face stiff competition in attracting foreign direct investment stemming from lower-cost locations, such as Indonesia and Vietnam. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Cambodia, given the growing attractiveness of their own business environments.
Institutions and policy trends: In the coming decades there will be no resolution of the power struggle between the established military and older bureaucratic elites on one side and the rural population and the younger generation yearning for change from the status quo on the other. The former will continue to side with the royal establishment to bolster their legitimacy, against the rural and younger masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate. The level of political tension will depend on successive governments' ability to restructure the economy further away from agriculture and tourism, not least by moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into high-value industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reform, as well as a focus on medium-to-long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy depends heavily on whether future governments are capable of initiating and implementing necessary structural reforms, while also upgrading the country's infrastructure. Liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population on the budget could be offset by greater use of advanced healthcare technology and 5G-enabled technologies. On the issue of boosting productivity to rival Thailand's competitors, the government could improve educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce and engage further with large domestic private firms to promote a more innovative economy. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas. A more probable and effective measure would be greater access to the labour market for immigrants, although rising ethnic tensions could undermine its implementation.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Thailand published a long-term climate change adaptation plan in 2015, entitled the Climate Change Master Plan 2015-50. It outlines a three-pronged approach, divided into mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building targets. Near-term goals include setting emission-reduction targets and establishing incentives for low-carbon-emission development. Medium-term targets included reaching at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable sources. Longer-term targets are vaguer, with general goals to increase private investment in green industries and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy. In line with this plan, Thailand signed and ratified the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2016, committing to specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under COP21, Thailand has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and "net-zero" greenhouse gas emissions by 2065. In November 2022 Thailand announced the second update to its nationally determined contribution to climate change, which showed a more ambitious target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30-40% from projected business-as-usual levels by 2030. The government also revised its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy, which proposes accelerated efforts to combat greenhouse emissions. Thailand's greenhouse gas emissions account for less than 1% of global emissions; emissions per head are below the global average, although concerns over air quality have grown in recent years. According to data from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022, annual growth of 0.8% in Thailand's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2011-21 was higher than the global average of 0.6%, but still lower than the Asia-Pacific average of 1.8%. CO2 emissions are projected to peak before 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency. Thailand benefits from a high share of the service sector, which emits fewer emissions than industry. More crucial to meeting the climate target by 2050 will be more far-reaching and costly measures, such as carbon pricing and plans to phase-out fossil fuels, which have yet to be introduced as part of the policy agenda, despite promises from the government.
The main determinant of emissions levels in Thailand in the coming decades will still be energy sourcing. Coal-fired power plants generate close to one-fifth of the country's electricity, while lesser-polluting liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation. Most of these plants are situated in the south of the country. The government will continue to push for the expansion of natural gas and renewable energy sources as a share of the country's energy mix, and renewable energy is likely to account for around one-quarter of total generation capacity by 2040. The commissioning of nuclear power plants in Thailand, which would reduce reliance on high-polluting forms, is also a possibility. However, relatively low coal prices will mean that the commodity continues to account for a sizeable share of energy generation over the next two decades, unless there is robust international pressure-and, crucially, concrete monetary incentives-for a change of course.
The country, especially its most economically productive areas, including the capital, Bangkok, will be vulnerable to the intensified impact of climate change in the coming decades. This will be felt most acutely through the rising sea level, flooding, droughts and air pollution, which will in turn feed into economic insecurity, infrastructure strains, health burdens and social unrest. In 2019 EIU developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth. Our latest calculations find that the Thai economy will be 3.1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments In May 2016 the Thai government unveiled "Thailand 4.0", a policy that aims to attract new investment to help transform the economy. The strategy of creating value via new technologies in strategic sectors will continue in 2023-27. Focus industries will continue to include smart electronics, electric vehicles, agriculture and biotechnology, food and beverages, and high-income and medical tourism. The strategy will also cover the development of new industries, such as robotics, aerospace, renewable energy, digital services, bioenergy and biochemicals and healthcare. Government incentives for investment in these sectors will remain in place, targeted explicitly towards the introduction of new technology, for example by offering import-duty exemption on capital goods for listed industries. Thailand will make some progress in upgrading its industries, but is likely to be constrained by a limited supply of skilled labour.
Migration and urbanisation In 2022 53% of Thailand's population lived in urban areas. This ratio is expected to increase to 58.4% in 2030, according to UN projections. Thailand's urban areas face issues that threaten to erode the quality of life for local residents, including inadequate public transport infrastructure, a lack of proper housing, urban sprawl, poor air quality and risks from natural as well as man-made disasters. In particular, rising sea levels pose a threat to Bangkok, which has an average elevation of only 1.5m above sea level. Flooding is a perennial problem. Migration from rural to urban areas will continue in the coming decades, which will exacerbate existing problems. Past and current governments in Bangkok have expanded the city's public transport network, adding new mass transit lines and increasing green space in the city. Significant challenges nevertheless remain and weigh on Bangkok's liveability in the long term. Lasting solutions will require action involving both the city and national governments, beyond the current patchwork of unco-ordinated measures.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr, will dominate the political landscape with the next presidential election not due until 2028. Mr Marcos will devote much of his first few years in office to guiding the country's continued economic recovery and restoring close ties with the US (likely to the upset of China). Longer-term policy initiatives include political and consti-tutional reforms on the empowerment of provincial authorities and anti-graft regime. EIU expects political stability to be maintained until at least around the mid-term elections in May 2024, when a new round of intense political jockeying could resurface.

- With reforms in the foreign direct investment sector and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) coming into effect in the Philippines, the country's business environment outlook improves in the forecast period. Although the macroeconomic environment is expected to deteriorate amid a wide current-account deficit and elevated external debt, a young workforce, increased regional integration, and friendlier po0licies towards businesses has helped to improve the score for market opportunities. The other main drags on the business environment score will be the political environment (which remains plagued by corruption and cronyism) and violent crime. The continued implementation significant corporate tax cuts throughout the forecast period will improve the score for taxes.

- We expect real GDP to grow at an average annual rate of 6.6% in 2023-27 as the impact of both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the covid-19 pandemic fades. Healthy growth will resume, supported by strong domestic demand from household consumption and investment related to the government's infrastructure plans. The budget deficit will remain wide in 2023 and will narrow only gradually throughout the forecast period. Recovery in domestic demand for goods imports and fast rising energy prices mean that the Philippines will record a relatively wide current-account deficit equivalent to 5.3% of GDP in 2023. The current account will continue to be in the red in our forecast period, albeit with much narrower deficits, due to a recovery in external demand and moderating energy prices.

- We believe that the annual average growth rate in population will slow marginally to 1.5% in 2023-27, from 1.6% in 2018-22. Free contraception has been available since December 2012, after the then government overcame opposition from the Roman Catholic church. However, uptake remains uneven because of the church's paramount influence in much of the Philippines. It is therefore likely that the impact of the government's policy will only be felt in the longer term. The country's fertility rate declined to 1.9 children per woman in 2022, which is lower than 2.1, the rate at which a population replaces itself from one generation to the next. Poverty and underemployment are expected to remain high in 2023-27, as the pandemic has reversed progress made in recent years in lifting people out of poverty.

- GDP per head will continue to grow in 2023-27, as the economic recovery from the pandemic remains strong. This means that the Philippines will remain on course to qualify as an upper-middle-income country in the latter part of our forecast period. Nevertheless, severe income inequality will remain an issue. Disparity between the richest and poorest households will remain acute in urban areas. Although the market for discretionary consumer goods will grow in cities, food and utilities will continue to account for the bulk of spending.

- In the absence of fundamental institutional reform, the Philippines is likely to underperform in the long term. Real GDP growth will average 4.5% per year in 2023-50. The high level of English-language skills will benefit the country. However, institutional obstacles to the effective implementation of policy and widespread corruption are likely to prevent a significant increase in the rate of gross fixed investment growth, resulting in a slowdown in the growth of productivity and income per head in 2031-50.

Background: The Philippine islands were ruled by Spain from 1565 to 1898, when the US took control. The islands became independent in 1946. The 21-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos (1965-86) was characterised by economic mismanagement and martial law. A democratic system was re-established under Corazon Aquino (1986-92) and maintained under Fidel Ramos (1992-98) and Joseph Estrada (1998-2001). In 2001 Mr Estrada was removed in a military-backed civilian coup and replaced by his vice-president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who won the presidential election in 2004. Mrs Aquino's son, Benigno Aquino, won the 2010 presidential poll and stepped down in June 2016 after serving a full term, and was replaced by a populist and former mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte. The country held its 17th presidential election in May 2022 and Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr (son of Ferdinand Marcos) was inaugurated as the new president in June 2022.
Political structure: There is a presidential system of government, with the president being limited to a single six-year term. Congress (the legislature) is modelled on the US system and comprises two directly elected bodies, the Senate (the upper house), normally with 24 members, and the House of Representatives (the lower house), with 304 members at present.
Policy issues: Mr Marcos's socioeconomic policy agenda aims to tackle issues of high inflation, food security, improved transport systems, affordable and clean energy, healthcare, education and social services, as well as improving fiscal management and bureaucratic efficiency. Implementing these will remain a challenge, as progress remains slow owing to a lack of legislative support.
Taxation: The corporate income-tax rate stands at 30%, but is expected to fall to 20% by 2029 as part of ongoing tax reform. Personal income-tax rates are structured into five bands, ranging from 5% to 32% of taxable income. Tax-exemption levels for individuals end at P250,000 (about US$4,700).
Foreign trade: The merchandise trade deficit (on a balance-of-payments basis) widened to US$69.4bn in 2022, from US$52.8bn in 2021. Exports totalled US$57.4bn in 2022, while imports recorded a marked increase to US$126.8bn. The wider trade deficit contributed to sharp increase in overall current-account deficit of US$17.8bn in 2022 owing to higher oil prices.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Although Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr continues to enjoy strong parliamentary majority and support in public opinion polls, the legislative process remains slow. The small number of laws passed suggests that Congress is not wholeheartedly supporting the priorities of the president despite the House of Representatives (the lower house) being led by his cousin, Martin Romualdez, and the Senate (the upper house) being led by Juan Miguel Zubiri, who is seen as a political ally of Mr Marcos. This apparent discrepancy is largely explained by Philippine legislators traditionally having very loose party affiliations, reducing the power of parties to channel decision-making processes and facilitate concerted legislative action.

Mr Marcos's congressional allies removed a former president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, as senior deputy speaker of the lower house in May for allegedly plotting to oust Mr Romualdez. This was then closely followed by Sara Duterte, the vice-president (who is the daughter of the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, and an ally of Ms Arroyo) , announcing her resignation from Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, the largest party that in the elections backed both her candidacy and that of Mr Marcos. These developments were widely attributed to a supposed rift between the Marcos and Duterte clans over Mr Marcos's foreign policy shift away from China towards the US and its allies. (Ms Arroyo and the Dutertes have long been strong advocates of friendly ties with Beijing, unlike the Marcoses, who found refuge in the US after Ferdinand Marcos Sr was ousted in the 1980s.)

Political outlook: Political stability The political scene will be dominated in 2023-27 by Mr Marcos, who won a landslide victory in the presidential election in mid-2022. Mr Marcos succeeded the popular Mr Duterte, who was constitutionally required to step down as president after serving a single six-year term. Overall, political stability will be maintained, given the scale of Mr Marcos's victory and favourable parliamentary election results. The representation of the centre-left opposition in Congress (parliament) has disintegrated amid perceptions of elitism and an inability to counter the populist rhetoric of the Duterte and Marcos administrations.
Tensions between the Marcos and Duterte camps represent a more sizeable risk to political stability than any posed by the formal political opposition. Mr Marcos has generally emphasised continuity with his predecessor's policies, and Mr Duterte's daughter, Sara, serves as the vice-president. However, as he settles further into power, Mr Marcos will probably seek to differentiate his own administration, opening up policy differences. His focus on the restoration of traditionally close ties with the US (Mr Duterte sought tighter relations with China) and efforts to soften his predecessor's controversial "war on drugs" are likely to be flashpoints. Tensions between the two camps will hamper some governmental functioning, although the long-standing sources of political influence held by Mr Marcos and his family suggest that his administration will not come under serious threat.
Mr Marcos's administration will be sensitive to risks stemming from economic conditions. Cost-of-living pressures will persist in 2023, and EIU expects his administration to make cash handouts to poor families and to subsidise the cost of essential goods, primarily to preserve its public-opinion ratings. However, despite rising cost-of-living pressures, we do not expect it to threaten political stability.
The political and security situation in the Bangsamoro region of the southern island of Mindanao is improving but will remain delicate. The establishment in 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was an important step forward in a peace process designed to end decades of armed conflict between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government. With Bangsamoro supposed to elect its own parliament in 2025, thus concluding the transition to autonomy, efforts at stabilisation will remain crucial. The disarmament of private militias and delivery of socioeconomic packages to ex-combatants remain issues that could derail the process.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Reform of political system is unlikely to be among the domestic priorities of the president, Mr Marcos. Previous calls for moving towards a more federal system and away from a Manila-centric model, including by then-president Mr Duterte, have not resulted in any tangible changes. The long-running debate over improving the quality and efficiency of administration across the country remains deeply contentious and only on a theoretical level, as there have been no clear signs that the public or major political forces favour a strong, centralised system. All previous attempts at overhauling the unitary system stalled. Considering Mr Marcos's political background and public statements favouring a more powerful central government, he is unlikely to make any serious push for such fundamental political reform as his government focuses on guiding the country back to steady economic growth and implementing infrastructure upgrade.
For decades after the country's independence, the realisation of policy-from the enactment of laws in Congress to their implementation-depended on the interplay of patronage networks around local powerbrokers, bonds of family and friendship, and semi-feudal socioeconomic relationships. Corruption and red tape are deeply rooted and pervasive, often distorting policy formation and implementation. These dynamics are unlikely to change in 2023-27.
Mr Marcos hails from an established northern political dynasty like many of his predecessors, which means he has maintained deep ties with the powerful vested interests in blocking the changes to institutions that are needed to root out the enduring customs of graft and nepotism in the longer term. This is apparent in the long-standing debate over legislation to weaken the grip of political dynasties on public office. Despite widespread criticism of political dynasties, they continue to play a critical role in Philippine politics and society, which is perhaps best made evident by the landslide election victory of Mr Marcos as president despite his relative lack of political experience and achievements. The election of Ms Duterte as vice-president also points to the emergence of yet another political dynasty. The Anti-Political Dynasty Bill has been pending in Congress since it was put forward in 2011. Previous attempts to tackle the prevalence of political families have failed to get off the ground (two-thirds of current members of Congress and many more local politicians hail from such dynasties). Prospects for change remain remote for the foreseeable future.
Political outlook: Election watch Mr Marcos's landslide victory in the May 2022 presidential election was the largest in recent history. In addition, his allies secured supermajorities in both chambers of Congress, ensuring that gaining legislative approval for his policies will be as straightforward as it was for his predecessor.
The next major nationwide elections are due in 2025, in the middle of Mr Marcos's six-year term, when half of the Senate and the whole House of Representatives will be elected. Mid-term elections often serve as de facto referendums on the performance of the president. They also guide the strategies of the country's prominent political camps ahead of the next presidential election. Although these are early days, Mr Marcos's allies are well placed to maintain their majorities in Congress in 2025.
There are three main political risks for the president: the possibility that his administration could be dragged into a corruption scandal; potential fallout from an expected slowdown in economic growth in 2023; and blowback from his decision to reassert the Philippines' relationship with the US over that with China (particularly if an international conflict breaks out in the South China Sea). However, our core forecast remains that Mr Marcos' administration will retain power in 2025.
Political outlook: International relations Mr Marcos's most notable foreign policy move so far has been his move to improve bilateral relations with the US, which has long been the Philippines' primary security partner and its biggest cultural influence, but was sidelined by the Duterte administration, which sought closer ties with China. The two countries expanded their Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement in early 2023, which increases the number of Philippine military bases that the US can access from five to nine. The location of most of these bases in the north of the country suggests that the US wants a greater presence close to Taiwan to counter possible Chinese aggression. In return for this access, the US president, Joe Biden, offered the Philippines an "ironclad" security guarantee. Heightened geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea will also prompt the Philippines to upgrade its security ties with other US-aligned countries, such as Australia and Japan.
The outlook for relations with China is consequently more problematic. Mr Duterte experimented with an alliance with China but found little benefit; China remained just as focused on occupying contested territories and continued to make naval incursions into Philippine territory, which caused embarrassment for the administration. On a visit to the Chinese capital, Beijing, in early 2023, Mr Marcos demonstrated his preference for keeping the relationship cordial; he returned with an agreement for the two countries to resume plans for joint oil-and-gas exploration in non-contested areas of the South China Sea. Nevertheless, China will maintain its incursions into contested waters, fuelling our belief that these exploration efforts are unlikely to come to fruition. Given the increasing competition between the US and China, relations between China and the Philippines are likely to remain relatively cool in 2023-27. There is a moderate risk of China retaliating against the Philippines for its alignment with the US, through the channel of bilateral trade.
The Philippines' relations with the rest of the international community-with the notable exception of its regional peers-will continue to be influenced by the government's approach to human-rights issues. Many Western administrations remain alienated by the country's violent "war on drugs" and the crackdown on critical media. Within the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the Philippines will remain one of the bloc's more hawkish members on Myanmar and will advocate a tougher line towards that country's junta, in view of its refusal to negotiate with the opposition.

Overview: The relaxation of foreign direct investment laws and improved taxation will help to improve the Philippines' overall score, but a lack of constitutional reform and difficulty in passing major policy decisions imply that the country will rise up by only one spot globally, to 55th, while its regional rank will remain at 12th.
Strengths: Foreign trade and exchange controls, as well as taxes will remain the country's strong points; the 2021 Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act will help to improve ease of doing business in the Philippines.
Weaknesses: Long-standing problems with the country's infrastructure will remain the biggest drag on the overall score, as well as sub-optimal policy towards private enterprise and competition, owing to the influence of large, monopolistic and politically influential family-run conglomerates.
What to watch
- The commitment to free-trade agreements (FTAs) will support positive changes to the score. EIU expects that the Philippines will seek membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and establish a trade deal with the EU in 2023-27.
- Rapid wage growth could be destabilising in the early part of the forecast period, owing to the acute political pressure for substantial minimum wage rises in the wake of the global cost-of-living crisis.

Business environment outlook: Philippines's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: New mining permits and applications for new casinos are considered, owing to the previous government's decision to reopen both industries in 2021.
2025-27: State-owned and politically connected family-run conglomerates, which benefit from government credits, continue to play a big role in the country's economic life at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: The economy starts to see the benefits of amendments made to the Retail Trade Liberalisation Act, the Foreign Investment Act and the Public Services Act, which have lowered specific barriers to entry substantially.
2025-27: Foreign direct investment remains low compared with the country's regional peers, owing to slow progress on the removal of the still-significant investment restrictions via constitutional reform.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: The ratification of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will strengthen and smoothen the trade processes to international standards.
2025-27: Negotiations on a free-trade deal with the EU and on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership gain momentum.
Taxes 2023-24: The new administration continues to implement the taxation reform package introduced by the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, which lowers corporate tax rates and rationalises fiscal incentives.
2025-27: Amid a persistently high fiscal deficit, the administration takes steps to enforce tax evasion laws more strongly. The application of value-added tax on digital services moves forward. Corporate tax rates will remain some of the highest in the Association of South-East Asian Nations.
Financing 2023-24: The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank) resumes its push for consolidation of small and rural banks to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the weak financial sector. The merger of the two largest state-owned banks is approved.
2025-27: The trend of bank consolidation and mergers intensifies amid rising competition from peers from other South-east Asian countries, following the deepening of regional economic integration in the services sector.
The labour market- 2023-24: The number of overseas Filipino workers starts to recover following the removal of international travel barriers. The upward pressure on minimum wage rates remains acute, owing to the cost-of-living crisis in 2022-23.
2025-27: A "brain drain" remains a major constraint to business expansion. Greater demand for skilled engineers and construction workers for infrastructure projects elevates the likelihood of wage inflation in this industry.
Infrastructure 2023-24: Infrastructure upgrade, focusing on transport and energy projects, forms a major part of the government's recovery strategy. Financing for these projects is expedited by new loan agreements with development organisations.
2025-27: The administration continues to push for private investment in infrastructure development, via the Maharlika Fund. Several major new energy and road projects come on stream. The New Manila International Airport is completed.
Technological readiness 2023-24: Policies will be enacted to encourage the use of mobile payment systems. The rollout of 5G services progresses.
2025-27: Internet broadband infrastructure becomes more reliable in the capital, Manila, and is extended to rural areas.

Overview: The Philippines' score for this category deteriorates to 6.3 in the forecast period, from 7.2 in 2018-22, pulling its global ranking down sharply, from 33rd to 56th. Regionally, the country's rank will fall by two places, to 13th. The deterioration will be caused by a more fragile public debt profile, a less stable local currency, and more exposed external finances. Much of the weakening will be due to the lingering economic impact by the pandemic on the country's "twin" deficits.
Strengths: The country's strengths lie mainly in the quality of its economic institutions and the sound policies that are pursued, as a result. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank), for instance, was one of the most aggressive central banks in the region in terms of its response to the 2022 global cost-of-living crisis; it increased its benchmark rate by 425 basis points in total, demonstrating commitment to price stability and maintaining the exchange rate.
Weaknesses: The budget deficit narrowed to 7.3% of GDP in 2022, from the pandemic-era peak of 8.6% in 2021, but this remains wide compared with developing Asia and the country's average deficit of 2.4% in 2015-19. The budget blowout pushed the debt/GDP ratio to over 60% in 2021 and has remained elevated since then, far above the 2019 level of 42%. We expect only a steady narrowing of the budget deficit to 3.9% of GDP by the end of the forecast period.
What to watch
- The finance secretary, Benjamin Diokno, has pledged to reduce the budget gap steadily, to 3% of GDP by the end of Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr's presidential term in 2028. However, this will be difficult if Mr Diokno sticks to his initial pledge of avoiding major tax reform and spending cuts, focusing merely on improving revenue collection from an administrative aspect. This promise appears to be fraying on the edges, with the administration now looking to implement tweaks in taxation to boost collection, including a value-added tax on digital services, more sin taxes, and an environmental excise tax on single-use plastics.
- Much of the Philippines' reputation for sound policymaking was earned during the tenure of a former president, Benigno Aquino, who oversaw a period of fiscal and public debt consolidation. His successor, Rodrigo Duterte, expanded on this legacy through the implementation of major tax reform, although his ambitious infrastructure drive caused a net deterioration in government coffers. Mr Marcos is running on a relatively thin policy platform, raising the inherent risks tied to policy uncertainty. Weak legislative support and loose party affiliations make it difficult to channel decision-making processes and facilitate quick legislative actions.

Overview: The Philippines' score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will rise modestly in the forecast period, from 4.5 in 2018-22 to 4.8. Faster improvements elsewhere will push down the country's global and regional rank to 64th and 12th places respectively. The improvement will stem from better protections in place for minority shareholders, although the bar for any progress on this front is very low. Such gains should be anchored by the country's efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, a free-trade bloc), as well as more intense negotiations for an FTA with the EU. The improvement here will be offset partially by greater store control over certain parts of the economy in 2023-27; we believe that state-owned enterprises will play a much greater role in the forecast period, owing to the impact of the pandemic on private enterprises.
Strengths: In recent years the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued new regulations, giving minority shareholders a say and empowering them to call special meetings. Aside from the expected improvement on this front, the protection of private property remains one of the country's core strengths, together-albeit to a smaller extent-with the freedom of businesses to compete and the general level of government regulation. Ongoing efforts to reduce red tape include the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, of which the full impact has yet to be realised owing to the disruptions caused by the pandemic.
Weaknesses: Structurally, family-run conglomerates with substantial vested interests will retain strong influence on policymaking, prolonging the sub-optimal environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) will continue to face difficulties in its effort to break down these monopolies and target trust practices.
What to watch
- The government might take control of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines, which will help to lower electricity prices. Although this will hamper energy efficiency, businesses will benefit from lower energy costs in the future.
- The Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act was signed in 2019, so it is too early to determine their efficacy, given the disruption caused by the pandemic. The act created the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), which is still in relative infancy. Whether or not ARTA will be able to make any progress in streamlining government processes and in reducing corruption during the forecast period is uncertain, as it faces internal and external challenges. Corruption runs deep and ARTA itself is not immune to this long-standing problem; in September 2022 the Office of the Ombudsman called the legislature to abolish the body on constitutional grounds.
- The PCC's work will remain critical in the forecast period. The commission has in recent years raised the mandatory notification threshold for mergers and acquisitions, making it easier for smaller companies to merge and compete with scale. It has also established "i-Stations" -outside Manila, to better monitor, investigate and take enforcement action against anti-competitive practices outside the capital, where SMEs are likely to have an even bigger disadvantage.
- The previous administration's efforts to reopen a few industries-in a bid to develop futures streams of government revenue-should open the door for domestic and foreign entrants in the forecast period. In 2021 Mr Duterte signed an executive order to lift the near-decade-long ban on new mines imposed by his predecessor, and, later that year, he repealed his own moratorium on new casinos.

Overview: The Philippines' score for policy towards foreign investment will rise to 6.9 in 2023-27, from 6 in the historical period. This will improve its global rank, to 43rd from 54th. That said, the improvement will not be enough to prevent its position in Asia slipping by one place, to 11th, owing to faster progress among its closest peers. We believe that the government's policy towards foreign investment will be more welcome in the forecast period, as overseas capital will be critical in supporting the post-pandemic recovery, especially once catch-up growth is fully exhausted.
Strengths: Much of the improvement in the operating environment for foreign investors will stem from the barrage of legislation signed by Mr Duterte just before he left office. In 2021 he signed amendments made to the 2000 Retail Trade Liberalisation Act which, among other things, lowered the minimum paid-up capital requirement, to P25m (US$444,422), for foreign retailers. In 2022 Mr Duterte signed changes to the Foreign Investment Act and Public Investment Act. The most important revisions entailed in the former include allowing foreign investors to own small and medium-sized enterprises, as long as they have US$100,000 in minimum paid-in capital-from US$200,000 previously.
Weaknesses: Regardless of the prospects of foreign direct investment (FDI) reform on a sector-by-sector basis, significant obstacles are likely to persist in the next five years outside the realm of corporate ownership, including the ban on foreigners owning land. The changes made by the previous administration to the Public Investment Act add an element of political risk, as they confer any president with the power to review investments that could threaten national security. Admittedly, this safeguard is reasonable when considering the significant liberalisations made in various sectors; telecommunications, airports, shipping and highways as public service were opened up to full foreign ownership in tandem.
What to watch
- Although the Marcos administration is keen on amending the constitution-in order to remove, or at least, lower long-standing barriers to foreign investment-it is not a priority. The charter includes major barriers to foreign participation in sectors such as utilities and natural resources. Admittedly, pressure from vested interests (particularly powerful conglomerate families) will continue to make the road to charter change extremely bumpy.
- The government will enjoy some success in further opening up the financial services sector in the forecast period, anchored by its obligations under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework. Meanwhile, the authorities will continue to operate the Foreign Investment Negative List system, which specifies the sectors in which foreign participation is restricted. In 2022 Mr Duterte approved the 12th edition of this list, via executive order, taking into account the aforementioned bills passed in the last months of his tenure. No fixed timetables are set for any changes, but the 13th edition will give a clearer indication of the Marcos administration's priorities in terms of FDI reform.

Overview: The score will remain 7.8 in the forecast period. Its global rank will slip by four places to 52nd, and its regional position will fall by one place, to 11th, as the country's nearest competitors see some progress in liberalising trade regulations and easing curbs on foreign exchange.
Strengths: The Philippines' profile is bolstered by the economy's general openness to trade, and the peso will continue to be freely convertible for current-account and most capital-account transactions. The country is a net importer of food and energy, so the risks of trade protectionism are relatively minute.
Weaknesses: The Philippines' main weakness is its less-than-fully-open capital account, which remains a drag on the overall score. Constitutional barriers to foreign investment, in particular, are likely to remain in some form throughout the forecast period and beyond.
What to watch
- The Philippines is likely to join the CPTPP in the early part of our forecast period, with a formal impact assessment already under way as a precursor to a membership application. Negotiations with the EU on a free trade deal will also gain renewed momentum.
- The government will continue to lower tariffs in line with the schedules set in FTAs concluded with members of ASEAN and other countries in the region. RCEP, which binds ASEAN's FTAs with five major countries into one agreement, entered into force for the Philippines in June 2023, following its ratification earlier in the year. This will support regional trade, although it will take time before the benefits materialise fully, because of variations in the tariff-reduction schedule and the extremely long timeframes for the most protected sectors, such as agriculture; still, the agreement is expected to lower rates on 98% of goods in the Philippines. Overall, the liberalisation envisaged under the ASEAN Economic Community (a single market for members) will continue to create new opportunities for companies, while also increasing competition with foreign firms at home. The scope for regional integration remains substantial, especially on non-tariff barriers.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 17 countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Overview: The score for taxes will rise substantially in the forecast period, to 7.5, from 6.3 in 2018-22. This will push up the Philippines' global ranking markedly, to 22nd from 40th, while its position in Asia will rise by one spot to ninth. The improvement will be due in large part to the historic tax reforms implemented by the previous government. Mr Duterte signed the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act in 2021, reducing the country's corporate tax rate and rationalising fiscal incentives. The rate of 25% (down from 30% previously) was applied retrospectively from 2020, and SMEs benefit from a lower preferential rate of 20%. The rate levied on foreign companies will start to fall this year, to a terminal rate of 20% by 2027.
Strengths: Policy predictability is likely to remain a main feature in the forecast period, following the major reforms pursued by the previous government. The incumbent finance minister, Mr Diokno, has repeatedly stressed that major changes are unlikely during the term of this administration, despite the fiscal holes created by the pandemic, with the government's focus likely to be on improving tax administration. Predictability in terms of fiscal incentives is also enshrined in the CREATE Act; the president now has the authority to apply preferential tax measures for a period of up to 40 years.
Weaknesses: The main components holding the country's score back in our model relate to incentives for investment, as well as the fairness and complexity of the tax system-long-standing issues that Mr Duterte's tax reforms have only partially addressed. Owing in part to the complexity of the rules, alongside the high level of corruption and inadequate enforcement, there remains a need to widen the tax base and boost compliance, in part to offset the loss of revenue from reductions in headline tax rates. Crucially, the reduction in corporate income tax rates in 2020 have not made the country competitive overnight; the Philippines still has some of the highest tax rates in the region.
What to watch
- Future tax reforms will focus on efforts to eliminate evasion-a serious and long-running problem-by strengthening the audit capabilities of the tax agency, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (although this will remain difficult because of the Bank Secrecy Law and widespread corruption).
- The most likely broadening of the tax base in the forecast period will probably come in the form of VAT on digital transactions, such as payments for streaming and other online services. The upper house is still considering a bill approved by the lower house in 2021 that would set such a levy, at 12%, a move backed by Mr Diokno, who was the governor of the central bank at the time. He has repeatedly stated a preference towards indirect, rather than direct, taxation to raise revenue.
- The next iteration of the Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP), due in 2025, will outline changes to fiscal incentives, if any. The SIPP, which was established by the CREATE Act, retains some of the characteristics of its predecessor-the Investment Priorities Plan-including a review every three years, which is positive in terms of its malleability, but constitutes a risk from the stand-point of predictability. At its most basic level, the SIPP lists the areas that are eligible for incentives, such as holidays on corporate tax for four to seven years, preferential rates thereafter, and tax waivers for imported capital goods. However, as a general rule, the most favourable terms will be offered to export-oriented companies, and those that are located outside the National Capital Region, a guiding principle that is unlikely to change in the forecast period.

Overview: The Philippines' financing score will remain unchanged in the forecast period, at 5.9. Improvements elsewhere will mean that the country's global position drops by 14 places, to 60th, while its score in Asia will remain stable at 5.9 in the forecast period, but its regional rank will fall from tenth to 12th.
Strengths: Foreign banks are allowed to enter the market with no investment restrictions. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer Act passed in 2021, which allows banks to sell off non-performing loans (NPLs) to asset-management companies, has helped to lower NPLs significantly. The financial system will become more integrated with the wider ASEAN market. Under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF), a small number of ASEAN banks will be licensed to operate across the bloc. As ABIF operates largely on bilateral level, however, progress on regional financial integration is likely to remain very uneven.
Weaknesses: The financial sector remains small and simple, with activity concentrated in basic bank and non-bank lending and deposit-taking. The regulatory environment is particularly conservative, especially when it comes to emerging industry trends. The BSP in mid-2021 shut the door for new digital bank licenses for at least three years, to monitor the impact of these institutions on the broader financial system.
What to watch
- The central bank will continue to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) over the forecast period, releasing more funds-structurally-to the banking system. The most recent reduction took place in June 2023, when the BSP lowered the RRR for commercial banks by 250 basis points, to 9.5%. The reduction was billed as an operational exercise, to offset the implicit tightening in policy by the expiration of some pandemic-era support measures in end-June 2023. However, more cuts are likely to come, as the overall trajectory of this structural shift is clear; at 9.5%, the Philippines still has one of the highest legally mandatory reserve ratios relative to its regional peers at the same level of development (even though it had been reduced by 10.5 percentage points since 2018).
- The proposed merger of the country's two largest state-owned banks, Land Bank and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), potentially could disrupt the playing field in the forecast period, through the formation of a more efficiently run-and larger-government-backed entity. In May 2023 Mr Diokno said that the deal could be finalised in November 2023, resulting in an institution with combined assets of more than P4trn-the largest in the industry-and efficiency savings of nearly P1bn per year. As of now, both institutions have different policy objectives, with Land Bank specialising mainly in agricultural credit, whereas DBP deals with Philippine industry.

Overview: More competitive labour costs, improvement in skills and snaller risk of industrial disputes will significantly improve the country's score lifting the Philippines' global rank from 55th to 24th. Regionally, the country will rise from 12th to fifth place.
Strengths: The country has a large pool of English-speaking surplus labour. The cost of firing workers is lower than in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Minimum wages vary across the country, preventing overly restrictive conditions in less developed areas, with workers in the capital, Manila, earning the highest daily wage. Philippine unions have a reputation for militancy, but the rate of unionisation will remain low in 2023-27, with fewer than 5% of workers belonging to a trade union.
Weaknesses: Skills shortages caused by a "brain drain" remain a long-standing problem, as more than 2m migrant Filipino workers are traditionally hired overseas each year. The most popular destinations for migration are the Gulf states and Singapore, although there are substantial flows to countries with historically large Filipino diaspora, such as the US.
What to watch
- Mr Marcos has pledged to pick up where Mr Duterte left off in terms of curbing the abuse of short-term contracts. During his electoral campaign, Mr Marcos said that he would tweak the latter's abandoned Security of Tenure Bill, which sought to end short-term "labour-only" contractualisation. He will encounter stiff opposition from the business sector, which has come to rely heavily on this entrenched system. Companies frequently hire workers on five-month contracts before firing and rehiring them in order to avoid the greater protections that are available to employees after six months.
- The cost-of-living crisis in 2022-23 is likely to exert upward pressures on wages, at least in the early part of the forecast period, owing partly to the long gap between the most recent minimum wage adjustment, in 2022, and the previous one in 2018. The minimum rate in the capital for non-agricultural workers rose to P570 (US$10) per day last year, after having remained at P537 since late 2018. Labour groups are pushing for a doubling of the minimum rate, at least, in the wake of the surge in prices over the last 12 months or so, which quickly wiped away last year's adjustment in real terms. At the moment, the upper house is considering a mere P150 across-the-board increase at the minimum. The BSP's latest data for the first quarter of 2023 show that the inflation-adjusted minimum wage has fallen by 10% from its peak in the second quarter of 2016.

Overview: The Philippines' global and regional rank in infrastructure will deteriorate, to 71st and 14th respectively, as competitor countries continue to make gains. Improvement in the reliability of power supply will be offset by a material increase in commercial rents.
Strengths: Infrastructure spending has been a key government focus under Mr Marcos. Government infrastructure spending rose to about 4.5% of GDP, from under 3%, during Mr Duterte's term, with the pandemic halting progress in his last few years in office. Hold-ups in capital spending should be expected, as some projects face lengthy delays from a lethargic bureaucracy and exposure to natural disasters.
Weaknesses: High logistics costs, due to the country's poor road network, ports and its patchy power supply, will continue to impose high operating costs on businesses. Not surprisingly, the Philippines' inadequate distribution infrastructure remains one of the biggest drags on its score. The country also lacks reliable railways, although this is partly a function of the archipelago's difficult topography.
What to watch
- The government will have to rely primarily on bilateral loans and official development assistance to fund projects already in the pipeline, at least in the first half of the forecast period, when the fiscal deficit is likely to remain elevated. The focus will remain on transport infrastructure, where local governments enjoy greater autonomy in the planning stage. The public-private partnership model should continue to account for part of the funding, especially for highway projects.
- A new channel for funding will be established in the forecast period, after the law to create the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), the Philippines' first sovereign wealth fund, is passed. The politically controversial MIF is unlikely to play a significant role in infrastructure development in its first few years, as its objectives and primary source of funds remain opaque.
- The ongoing P35.4bn Cavite-Laguna Expressway project should be completed by the end of 2024, connecting some of the biggest export-processing zones with ports in Batangas and Manila. The previous government in June 2022 signed a toll agreement with San Miguel Corporation for the Southern Access Link Expressway, paving the way for its construction. The aim of the project partly is to provide access to the New Manila International Airport, which is scheduled to be completed by 2027.

Overview: The Philippines' score for technological readiness strengthens to 6.1 in the forecast period, from 4.4 in 2018-22. This will lead to an improvement in its global rank to 54th, from 67th, while its regional position will rise by two places, to 12th. Progress will be made primarily by gains in the mobile space, as well as improvements in research and development spending, and infrastructure. Internet use will also increase, albeit from a low base, as well as the country's overall preparedness for cyber-security risks.
Strengths: The country's mobile internet access will improve significantly, particularly among younger, urban consumers; progress on this front will be noticeable in rural areas, where establishing fixed connectivity remains challenging. The Philippines' dominant telecoms providers will unveil new mobile infrastructure, but internet speeds will remain among the slowest in the region. The availability of cheap mobile phones remains a big driver; Chinese manufacturers-Realme, Transsion, and Oppo-continue to dominate the top three spots in terms of smartphone sales in the country, owing to their cost competitiveness.
Weaknesses: Compared to Indonesia, which is the fairest base of comparison regionally due to both countries' large populations, still-low levels of per-head income and archipelagic geography, the Philippines scores slightly weaker in terms of internet use.
What to watch
- The private sector will engage heavily in the implementation of the plans to digitise government services. Early in the forecast period, government departments will undergo security assessments, and the central storage and encryption of government agencies' data will begin. The effective implementation of this strategy could reduce the risk of major data breaches, but exposure will remain high compared to regional peers.
- Increased risk of cyber-attacks and new regulations during the forecast period will prompt companies to upgrade their defences, although implementation will be inconsistent across sectors. Since 2019 the central bank has required all financial institutions to report cyber-attacks to a Cyber-security Incident Database. The Department of Justice and the cybercrime division of the Philippine National Police will continue to lead enforcement.

Economic forecast: Policy trends EIU expects Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr to stick to the pro-market approach to policymaking previously implemented by the former president, Rodrigo Duterte. This will include more initiatives aimed at improving the business environment and strengthening competitiveness by liberalising the regulatory regime for investment and enhancing infrastructure. Without a strong tradition of left-wing politics, parliamentarians in both the conservative and liberal camps are proponents of a business-friendly agenda. This will ensure the delivery of a phased cut in corporate tax from 30% to 20% by 2029, which was signed into law in 2021. Nonetheless, endemic corruption and inefficient bureaucracy will continue to dilute the impact of major reforms.
There is wide recognition that the poor state of infrastructure remains one of the main impediments to doing business in the Philippines. Mr Marcos will push through further legislation to implement the "Build, Build, Build" infrastructure programme approved under Mr Duterte. One example is the underground Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP), which will eventually link Quezon City to the north of Manila with Parañaque in the south. Tunnel boring began in early 2023 and the project has an estimated completion date of 2028. Financing for the MMSP has been secured through soft loans from Japan. Other projects will struggle for public funding, given the government's greater focus on fiscal discipline following a surge in both public debt and the budget deficit during the pandemic. Instead, the government will seek financing from the private sector, exacerbating delays. Projects also routinely face hold-ups as a result of corruption and bureaucratic inertia.
Mr Marcos has begun the process of launching a sovereign wealth fund, the Maharlika Investment Fund, to invest in large-scale projects at home and abroad. The fund is a quixotic idea: such funds are typically created to make productive use of commodity revenue, whereas Mr Marcos wants to use state-owned banks, pension funds and the proceeds of privatisations to provide capital-a move that could destabilise the public finances if investments fail to deliver adequate returns. The supporting legislation is currently under debate in the Senate; the strength of the president's support in the chamber is such that a version of the fund is likely to be approved, raising contingent risks.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Government expenditure 23.5 23.0 21.9 21.4 21.3 20.7
Government revenue 16.1 16.7 16.6 16.8 17.1 16.8
Budget balance -7.3 -6.3 -5.3 -4.6 -4.2 -3.9
High commodity prices and financial support for low-income households will keep government spending elevated in 2023. Against this background, the president received congressional approval for a record budget of P5.3trn (US$91.8bn), which means that another wide deficit will be posted this year. However, the growth in budget expenditure is relatively modest compared with that recorded in 2021, and demonstrates some intention to restore fiscal discipline over time. Nevertheless, we expect that economic growth will be slower than the government is expecting in 2023, and this will lead to some unplanned additional disbursements and possibly a wider than budgeted fiscal deficit.
The government plans to finance its deficit through the issuance of new bonds and borrowing from multilateral organisations. Tighter spending controls and stronger revenue growth will help to keep the level of public debt manageable in the latter part of the forecast period. However, pressure for continued investment in education and healthcare, to cater for a rising population, will ensure that the fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP does not return to its narrower, pre-2020 levels in 2023-27 despite sustained consolidation.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates
(%)
  2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
91-day Treasury-bill rate (av) 2.2 4.4 4.0 3.8 3.5 3.2
We believe that Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank) ended the monetary tightening cycle that began in May 2022 in March 2023, after a cumulative 425-basis-point increase in the policy rate to 6.25%, the highest level since 2007. Moderating inflation and a reduction in depreciation pressure on the peso's exchange rate have provided the central bank with space to hold off on further rate rises.
We forecast that the BSP will maintain status quo before cutting the policy rate in the fourth quarter of 2023, when consumer price inflation will have come back within the central bank's target range of 2-4%. We expect further gradual loosening throughout 2024, bringing the policy rate to 5% by the end of the year.
The BSP will aim to maintain a neutral level for the policy rate in the remainder of our forecast period (2025-27), probably about 4%, with inflation forecast to remain within its target range.

We expect economic growth to slow to 5.3% in 2023, from 7.6% in 2022, as global demand slackens. Real exports of goods contracted at a double-digit rate in the first quarter and continued to contract in April. Even with the cushion provided by a rebound in tourism service exports, we still expect exports of goods and services to contract in real terms over 2023, detracting from growth. Domestic consumption will, instead, provide the main support to economic growth. We forecast that private consumption will grow by 5.5% in 2023, supported by higher wages and low unemployment, due to firm activity in the services sector. Weak transmission of monetary policy will limit the impact of high interest rates on consumer demand and domestic investment.
We forecast that growth will accelerate to 7.4% in 2024 as stronger global demand supports a return to export expansion. For the remainder of the forecast period (2025-27), the economy is forecast to grow at an average of 6.8% per year. The removal of entry and ownership restrictions on foreign businesses and gains from supply chain diversification will drive investment growth. Consumption will continue be a major driver of growth.
Despite some regional diversification of supply chains from China, the Philippines' manufacturing industry is less likely than those of its peers (such as Vietnam) to benefit significantly from this trend, owing to a higher tax burden and weaker infrastructure. Meanwhile, its services sector (business outsourcing and tourism, for example) will resume its steady upward trajectory.
The severe contraction during the pandemic and the subsequent slowdown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean that real GDP levels in 2023-27 will remain below how the economy could have performed under the pre-pandemic growth trend.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The share of agriculture as % of GDP will decline in the forecast period from 13.3% in 2022 to 11.1% in 2o27 reflecting continuing structural transformation. Agriculture contributes a miniscule proportion to overall economic growth. Although, over the years, the share of employment in agriculture has declined, it is still a labour-intensive sector and remains a major source of employment in rural areas, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic. Severe weather events, such as frequent typhoons and extreme dry spells, will continue to disrupt the sector's productivity given the country's geographic location. We expect the agriculture sector to grow at an annual average rate of 3.3% in 2023-27.
The industry sector will remain the second-largest sector in the economy, accounting for about 40% 0f GDP in 2023-27. With the government's push towards building public infrastructure and efforts to bring in foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, the sector will grow at an average rate of 5.3% in the forecast period, slower than the pre-pandemic average of 6.9% in 2015-19. This subpar pace of expansion reflects a long-stagnant industrialisation process in the Philippines that has been characterised by low levels of foreign invest-ment and innovation. However, the country will still record some growth in manufacturing, as its English-speaking and relatively cheap labour force attracts foreign investors and businesses. Furthermore, the government's efforts to improve the business climate and relax foreign ownership restrictions will boost the sector's fortunes in the longer term, amid the global diversification of supply chains, although this will pale in comparison with its regional peers.
Services will continue to be the Philippine economy's largest sector by 2027, accounting for 62.8% of GDP in 2027. With a pick-up in tourism, the sector is expected to expand by an annual average of 7.1% in 2023-27. The telecommunications sector will continue to grow briskly as the new government proceeds with the rollout of 5G networks in 2023-27. Business-process outsourcing will remain the largest source of services income in the forecast period. The sector will be at risk from rising competition and automation, but these factors will only start to affect growth prospects beyond the current forecast period.

We anticipate a moderation in consumer price inflation over the remainder of 2023, after it peaked at 8.7% in January. The main driver of this trend will be a lowering of global oil and commodity prices. This will return inflation to the BSP's target range of 2-4% in the fourth quarter of the year. Sticky core inflation will be the main factor continuing to feed into headline inflation. This will be evident in rising prices of clothing and footwear, restaurants and accommodation and personal care services.
The most notable risk to this forecast arises from extreme weather events affecting agriculture production and, subsequently, food prices. Food is a major contributor to headline inflation, with a weight of nearly 37% in the consumer price index basket. With economic activity remaining below trend, the upside risk to inflation would give the BSP an awkward monetary policy dilemma.
Looking further ahead, our central scenario assumes that a stronger peso, neutral interest rates and consistent growth in consumer spending will keep inflation under control in the remainder of the forecast period, at an annual average of 3.3% in 2025-27 (within the BSP's target band).

After depreciating sharply in 2022, the peso has been on a strengthening trend against the US dollar. We expect this to persist over the remainder of the year, as the end in mid-2023 of the monetary policy tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) supports demand for emerging-market currencies. Relatively high interest rates in the Philippines-preserving an interest-rate differential with the US-and easing inflation will also support the currency. We forecast that the currency will stand at P53.2:US$1 at end-2023, compared with P56.1:US$1 a year earlier.
We expect the BSP to begin to reduce interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2023, which will put some downward pressure on the peso. However, better economic prospects and increased foreign investment will also help to reduce depreciatory forces on the currency.
For the rest of the forecast period, strong macroeconomic fundamentals will support a strengthening of the peso as inflation moderates, economic activity rebounds (supported by strong exports and domestic consumption) and interest rates are maintained at a neutral level. At the same time, appreciation will be limited by a persistent current-account deficit and the peso's reputation as a risky currency to hold, which will maintain its inverse correlation with investor risk appetite. Nonetheless, we expect the peso to appreciate slowly, drawing close to the P50:US$1 threshold in 2027 (in annual average terms).

Current-account balance (% of GDP) -4.4 -5.3 -5.1 -4.3 -2.6 -1.1
A widening of the goods trade deficit in 2023 will cause the overall current-account deficit to widen to the equivalent of 5.3% of GDP in 2023, compared with 4.4% of GDP in 2022. This will mainly reflect weaker global demand for goods. In contrast, the services surplus will be supported by the return of Chinese travellers. The secondary income account will remain firmly in surplus, although we anticipate little growth in remittance inflows in 2023, owing to weak global growth.
For the rest of the forecast period, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow, providing support to the peso's value. Stronger global demand from 2024 will help to narrow the goods trade deficit, while we expect strong growth in remittances to support the secondary income surplus. We forecast that the balance will register a small deficit equivalent to 1.1% of GDP in 2027.
With the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (a mega-regional trade deal) now in effect, the Philippines will shift its focus to trade talks with the EU and will make efforts to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in the latter part of our forecast period.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Philippines Stocks and flows Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into the Philippines declined by 23.2% to US$9.2bn in 2022, according to the latest data from the UNCTAD. The stock of FDI increased to only US$113bn (about 28% of GDP), less than countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia but higher than Indonesia. The decline in flows reflected the impact on sentiment of a slowdown in global growth amid geopolitical uncertainty and US monetary policy tightening. Foreign investors were also discouraged by the FDI restrictions in place, which were only relaxed in 2022-but only partly. Acquisitions by local investors of foreign affiliates-such as that by the Union Bank of the Philippines, which bought the Philippine consumer banking business of Citigroup (US) for US$1.4bn-would have also contributed.
Origin and distribution In 2022 Japan was the principal source of FDI in the Philippines, followed by the US, according to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank). The Association of South-East Asian Nations as a regional group brought in net FDI of US$610m, with the largest contribution from Singapore, followed by Malaysia. Despite the efforts of the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, to bring in investment from China, net FDI from China fell in 2022. The sectors attracting the greatest interest from foreign investors include business-process outsourcing and the manufacture of electronics products. The Philippines' labour costs are not among the lowest in the region, but the population's widespread English-language skills and an improving telecommunications infrastructure, alongside incremental regulatory reform, should support FDI in these sectors in the next few years.
Determinants Reforms in opening up the FDI sector will allow international investors to set up and fully own small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as hold 100% equity in firms in sectors where they could already operate. Earlier, foreign investors could invest in small businesses only if they hired at least 50 Filipino workers. The Philippines' relatively illiberal investment environment and policy uncertainties have long proven unattractive to businesses in comparison with the country's regional peers. Currently, the constitution prohibits a foreign company or individual from owning the majority share in a Philippines-based company. In March 2023 the House of Representatives passed a resolution to amend the constitution, however, neither the Senate nor the president has expressed any interest in amending the 36-year-old constitution. On the contrary, the House speaker, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez (who is also the cousin of the president, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr), believes that the constitutional amendment will bring in the much needed investment and create more jobs for the Philippinepopulation. Given the lack of consensus within the current administration, much will depend on whether a resolution is passed by the upper house. EIU believes that is unlikely in its forecast period. Meanwhile, Mr Marcos is banking on an improved relationship with the US to bring in much needed foreign investment.
Impact Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 the Philippines has attracted FDI chiefly into its electronics sector, which is now an integral part of the global supply chain. This has helped to create a more stable and value-added source of export receipts compared to commodities such as agricultural produce. However, this has not led to a wholesale change in business practices. This is mainly because of the country's continued use of the Foreign Investment Negative List. Many sectors remain closed to foreign investors. Companies operating in the media are allowed to use Philippines Depository Receipts (PDR), through which foreign investment can be obtained without giving foreigners ownership rights. However, the use of such vehicles relies heavily on the discretion of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been known to use its authority to safeguard vested political and commercial interests. In June 2022 it affirmed its previous order to revoke the operating rights of Rappler, an online newspaper that has been a vocal critic of some of Mr Duterte's politics, on the grounds that the newspaper had allowed foreign investors to influence the company's policies.
Potential With the passing of the Foreign Investment Act, a number of restrictions faced by foreign participants have been reduced in the Philippines. Although other countries in the region also impose protectionist restrictions to varying degrees, limitations on foreign ownership in certain strategic industries are included in the Philippine constitution. In March 2022 the Philippines introduced an FDI review mechanism in military-related industries, cyber-infrastructure, pipeline transport and other such activities that may threaten the territorial integrity and the safety, security and well-being of citizens. Mr Marcos promised to continue his predecessor's course of improving the investing environment, but has not offered any clear plans to change the constitution. The president is unlikely to expend political capital on this issue as his administration grapples with the more urgent issue of guiding the economy. Mr Marcos's foreign policy pivot towards the US can help to bring in more foreign investment from that country into the Philippines.

Population growth will slow, but only gradually in the longer term The Philippines' population growth rate will moderate marginally compared to the historical period, but will remain relatively rapid and among the highest in South-east Asia in 2023-27, at 1.5% per year on average. This compares with projected growth rates of less than 1% in Indonesia and Vietnam, which boast a comparable GDP per person. The Philippines' relatively rapid rate is attributable to the Roman Catholic church's opposition to birth control, as well as a cultural preference for large families. The latter is an especially strong factor for poor families, as children are expected to contribute to the household income when they reach working age. A further factor supporting robust population growth is rising life expectancy as healthcare services and diets improve. Nonetheless, increasing incomes and greater female participation in the workforce will serve to constrain the rate of population growth. Notably, the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, went against the Catholic Church and launched a campaign to raise awareness of family planning before his term ended in June 2022. Medical centres are now mandated to distribute free contra-ception to poor families, which will also temper population growth beyond the forecast period.
Inequality of income will remain glaring in the forecast period A combination of relatively rapid population growth and unequal distribution of wealth and economic opportunity has contributed to endemic poverty across the country. Moreover, poverty remains much more prevalent among women and children than men. Successive previous administrations had failed to narrow the gap between rich and poor, and many hopes were pinned on the newly inaugurated Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. The government has traditionally extended spending on social welfare programmes and healthcare, but the disbursement of funding remains problematic. The pandemic exacerbated the plight of the poor, as they suffered the brunt of the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. The incidence of poverty will remain elevated during the forecast period.
An increase in low-quality jobs will result in depressed wages Despite a decline in unemployment rate and increase in labour force participation rate in 2023 compared to 2022, more jobs are being created the agriculture and the services sector. A larger proportion of workers either work part-time or in low and irregular pay work. An increase in the share of self-employed workers indicate growth of an informal labour market. Amid high inflation and low productive jobs, real earnings of households have declined.
Outbound migrant labour will resume after the lifting of covid-19 restrictions For decades a large number of Filipinos have had to travel overseas in search of more profitable employment. According to government data, there were an estimated 6m Filipinos overseas at the end of 2020, about 5.2% of the population. Permanent migrants from the Philippines have settled mostly in the US and Canada, while temporary workers are mainly concen-trated in the Gulf states and elsewhere in Asia. Significant outward migration remains a feature of the Philippines. Demand for Filipino healthcare workers is strong in the West, owing to their proficiency in English. Although this has helped to mitigate the country's unemployment problem, concerns persist about the long-term "brain-drain" effect of the departure of so many people.
One effect of the country's high birth rate and relatively low life expectancy is a low old-age dependency ratio, meaning that the cost to the productive members of the population of maintaining the pensions of the economically dependent will remain low in the forecast period.

A relatively low level of GDP per head could limit market opportunities Economic output in the Philippines is estimated to be at about US$404bn in 2022-small when considered among major ASEAN economies but still larger than Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. The Philippines is still a small market, with GDP per head standing at only US$3,492 at market exchange rates and US$10,068 in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022. However, the country's economic output still continues to be below the pre-pandemic trend levels in 2023. GDP per head will continue to rise in 2023 and beyond. Resuming a steady (if slightly less robust) growth trajectory from 2024, GDP per head will reach US$6,159 at market exchange rates by the end of the forecast period. However, the Philippines will continue to lag behind South-east Asia's richer economies, with a lower level of GDP per person than the likes of Malaysia and Thailand, but higher than economies including Indonesia. Severe income inequality will also remain an issue. Disparity between the richest and poorest households will continue to be particularly acute in urban areas. However, about 50% of the country's population is under 25 years old, ensuring a continued supply of new consumers in the coming years and boosting demand for more innovative products and sales channels.
Favourable demographics and healthy economic growth will support the country's retail sector after the pandemic. In volume terms, we expect real retail sales to expand by an average of 4.6% per year in 2023-27. Increasing affluence and rising urbanisation will lift demand for goods supplied by modern chain stores. Nonetheless, small traditional shops and markets are likely to remain the dominant retail channels. Online platforms will emerge as a major medium for transactions to cater to technologically savvy young consumers-a trend that has been accelerated by the pandemic.
Organised retailing in the Philippines is dominated by four major local companies. The largest is SM Investment. The group's retail arms are SM Prime Holdings (which operates shopping centres) and SM Retail. Recent market liberalisation will probably lead to greater participation of foreign businesses in the retail sectors, as they are now subject to a lower capital investment threshold and are no longer required to sell almost one-third of their equity to the public within eight years of starting operations. However, some restrictions, such as land ownership, continue to apply, which will probably prevent foreign-owned retailers from challenging the dominance of the four domestic giants.
Meanwhile, the rural poor, who mostly rely on subsistence farming for a living, will benefit only to the extent that the government directs its spending towards them. Government transfers have facilitated growth in private consumption among lower income brackets in recent years. However, such growth is prone to setbacks, as the rural population is particularly vulnerable to change in government policy priorities, as well as extreme weather conditions.
Remittance inflows will continue to support domestic consumption Inflows of remittances from Filipinos working abroad will continue to grow steadily and buoy consumer expenditure. Furthermore, banks are moving away from their traditional areas of activity and are placing more emphasis on retail financial products sold via digital channels, such as personal loans, insurance policies and credit cards; these trends will enhance consumer opportunities by tapping into the previously hard-to-reach populace.

Consumer spending on food accounted for 42.2% of total household expenditure in 2022, reflecting accelerated inflation and stagnant real household income. Food, beverages and tobacco will continue to dominate household spending in the forecast period, while accounting for a progressively smaller share of total expenditure. Increasing affluence and rising urbanisation will lift demand for goods supplied by modern chain stores. Convenience-store retailing is also set to expand rapidly in the forecast period after the pandemic, reflecting both rising incomes and changing working practices. Nonetheless, small traditional shops and markets are likely to remain the dominant retail channels. Wet markets and small sari-sari convenience stores, which are mostly run by low-income households, will remain popular.

Initial conditions: After gaining independence from the US in 1946, the Philippines spent many years in a political crisis, during which the economy lost momentum and poverty rocketed. The country had strong growth potential owing to its large and young population, relatively high standards of education and natural resources. Nevertheless, excessive protection of local manufacturing (leading to the misuse of resources), along with years of kleptocracy, corruption and institutional weakness, distorted both the formulation and the implementation of coherent economic policy. The promotion of the labour-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing sector in the mid-1970s improved standards of living, but the economy continued to underperform owing to the country's poor infra-structure and institutional weakness.
Demographic conditions: The Philippines has a large young population: 30.8% of the population in 2022 were estimated to be below 15 years of age (young dependents), the second-highest level in Asia (after Pakistan). By contrast, the proportion of the population aged above 65 is only 5.4%, significantly less than its regional peers. This has resulted in a demographic dividend that gives the Philippines an edge over other countries, alongside the fact that it has a primarily English-speaking population. However, a lack of opportunities for skilled workers means that many will seek opportunities in overseas markets, resulting in a significant "brain drain" in the country.
External conditions: Electronic goods account for more than 50% of total exports. In 2021-30 the Philippines is likely to face increasing competition from other burgeoning manufacturing hubs in the region, such as Indonesia and Vietnam. This will force the country to double down on its traditional strength in the services sector in the long term, as successive governments try to boost job creation and the competitiveness of the economy.
EIU expects the Philippines to remain committed to free trade and to become part of new bilateral and multilateral trade agreements in 2021-50. As such, its external sector will become more diversified, and it will have access to more markets. The good English-language skills of the Philippine labour market will remain vital to the country's competitive position vis-à-vis its peers in the region. A significant reduction in the number of Filipinos seeking jobs abroad is unlikely in the next decade or so, as the local economy will have difficulty absorbing a relatively fast-growing population.
The Philippines' membership of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will provide a major stimulus to trade. The ASEAN Economic Community is progressively lowering tariffs as part of wider plans to establish a single market. We believe that ASEAN will continue to make slow progress towards this goal during the remainder of the current decade. With the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) coming into force and the Philippines being a part of it, the agreement will help to streamline a number of processes for international trade for the country. A free trade agreement with the EU, ASEAN's second-largest trading partner after China, has also been proposed and could come to fruition by the end of this decade.
Institutions and policy trends: Political stability has mostly been ensured for the past decade under successive presidents, although political opposition at times threatened to stall decisions from the executive. The political and security situation in the Bangsamoro region of the southern island of Mindanao is improving but will remain delicate. The establishment in 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was an important step forward in a peace process designed to end decades of armed conflict between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government. With Bangsamoro supposed to elect its own parliament in 2025, thus concluding the transition to autonomy, efforts at stabilisation will remain crucial. The maintenance of political stability will be the key to guaranteeing economic policy certainty and a focus on development in the coming decades.
One of the weakest aspects of the Philippines' political system is the emphasis on personality and patronage, rather than party allegiances. A unicameral parliamentary system would facilitate the passage of government legislation, as bills could no longer be blocked by the Senate (the upper house of Congress), but an overhaul of the entrenched political system is largely implausible. More broadly, any significant shift in the country's political culture will be extremely slow. The focus of foreign policy will probably remain on the South China Sea, as the long-running dispute simmers, and on the country's economic orientation, amid tensions in the region between China and the US.
Long-term performance: Geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea will continue to hinder economic progress in the Philippines in the long term. Increasing probability of a conflict with China will deter investors from investing despite improvement in fundamentals. Although the demographic profile of the Philippines holds out the possibility of a stronger performance in the long-term forecast period, economic growth is likely to remain below potential in the absence of more rapid structural change. The high level of English-language skills will be of benefit, although this could become less valuable as others catch up, and the economy will also be able to absorb-gradually-more of its workforce. Proficiency in English should improve further in 2022-50, following the reintroduction of the language as the primary medium of instruction in secondary schools. Nevertheless, institutional obstacles to the formulation and implementation of farsighted policies are likely to prevent a significant increase in the rate of gross fixed investment growth. Rising investment in infrastructure and manufacturing will be encouraging in the medium term but, in general, more rapid improvements will be achieved in neighbouring countries.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The Philippines' geographical location renders it vulnerable to natural calamities. With the important exception of the southern island group of Mindanao, most of the country is situated within the typhoon belt. This exposure has persistently depressed output in the agriculture sector, although this has more of an impact on costs of living and employment than on the country's economic growth, given the sector's relatively small size. Over the years, successive governments have also focused on policies that support the country's quick recovery from natural disasters and have invested in the development of relatively efficient early-warning systems. The Philippines is also extremely vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels. In March 2017 Congress unanimously ratified the Paris Climate Agreement. The country then went on to set its intended nationally determined contribution (NDC) later that year, setting a target of reducing carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 relative to a "business as usual" scenario. Despite the fact that the administration of Rodrigo Duterte did very little to work towards the target (most notably continuing to open and plan new coal plants), the country pledged in April 2021 to raise its carbon-emission reduction target to 75%. However, the caveat is that 72% of the target applies only if the Philippines receives sufficient financial and technological aid from developed countries, which has not happened so far and remains a very remote possibility in the foreseeable future. The country has also yet to come out with a net-zero target. Given the ambitious target, which is more difficult than even those set by the US and the EU and by far the most aggressive in the region, it is extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet even a fraction of its 2030 goals. According to EIU's model on the impact of climate change on long-term growth, we find that the Philippine economy will be about 3.6% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments Over the long term, the Philippines will have to play catch-up to technological advancements elsewhere. The country has consistently spent less than 1% of its GDP on research and development, while its schools have proved unable to produce qualified specialists in innovative technology. Its large business-process outsourcing (BPO) sector will face greater competition from automation amid rising wages. To mitigate some of these effects, BPO operators have already begun to adapt by offering higher-skilled services. Successive governments have initiated small steps towards reorienting its economy to more sophisticated industries. For instance, in 2017 Mr Duterte signed a law that provides free tertiary education to all local students applying for places in national universities or polytechnics. It will take years, and related advances in the country's business environment and digital infrastructure, for the benefits of such measures to materialise.
Migration and urbanisation In 2022 nearly 48% of the population resided in urban areas, bringing it almost at par with countries like Thailand but less than Indonesia. A significant percentage of its population still resides in rural areas. By 2050, 84% of Filipinos are expected to reside in urban areas, according to estimates by the UN Human Settlements Programme. Philippine cities are facing major demographic, environmental, economic, social and spatial challenges. Many big and small cities, including Metro Manila, face issues related to poor transport infrastructure, a lack of proper housing, urban sprawl, as well as the impact of natural and man-made disasters. The Philippines will continue to remain one of the foremost countries of origin for migrant workers, with a substantial flow of people into the Middle East and Asia. A large proportion of these people will continue to remain unskilled workers.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows EIU to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by EIU for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2018-22) and from EIU assessments for the forecast period (2023-27). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by EIU for 2018-22. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2023-27 are based on EIU assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; EIU, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2018-22 ranges are then used to derive 2023-27 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2023-27, not to the likely situation in 2027 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2020 or 2025). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Ecuador is the world's largest fully dollarised economy (outside the US). Fiscal and monetary orthodoxy has reduced macroeconomic imbalances, but political dysfunction and reliance on oil revenue could trigger new crises.
- An early general election will be held in August, after the president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party, dissolved the legislature in May, to avoid an impeachment vote. EIU expects a left-wing president to assume office, although there is a chance that a right-of-centre candidate will win by leveraging growing concerns about insecurity.
- Mr Lasso will use his last months in office to pursue his market-friendly agenda by using his executive powers, but we expect progress to be piecemeal. Policymaking is likely to shift towards the left after the election, with increased social spending, wider fiscal deficits and a partial reversal of Mr Lasso's policies.
- GDP growth will slow in 2023, as political uncertainty and high domestic interest rates will curb private investment, and a weak labour market and a slowdown in remittances will subdue private consumption. We forecast modest average growth of 2.2% per year in 2024-27, although political instability will sustain the risk of another downturn.
- A series of trade surpluses and a reduction in external debt payments early on in our 2023-27 forecast period will contain external risks, although a weak fiscal position and a steeper amortisation schedule in 2025-27 will sustain the need for external financing.
- We expect inflation to slow to 1.2% by end-2023 as supply-side pressures ease. Ecuador's dollarised system (which we expect to remain in place even under a leftist government) will keep the country's inflation rate among the lowest in the region in 2023-27.
- We believe that a new left-wing government will strengthen ties with China (in part to seek bilateral financing) and that relations with the US, which have improved markedly under Mr Lasso, will cool.
- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings. Although mineral reserves will continue to attract investors, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will rise slowly in 2023-27. Business opportunities will therefore remain restricted by low purchasing power and a small market size.

- Ecuador's score improves in the 2023-27 forecast period, reflecting changes that the former president, Lenín Moreno (2017-21), introduced towards the end of his tenure, as well as the Lasso administration's market-friendly stance. However, a left-wing government is likely to take power at this year's snap election, raising risks that recent improvements in the business environment will be reversed.

Country forecast overview: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2023-24: Policies to promote private-sector investment stall as new-probably left-wing-administration takes office.
2025-27: State's role in development grows as regulation and licensing favour state-run companies over private-sector ones. Price controls on fuels remain in place, possibly expanding to other areas. Tighter regulations imposed on private firms.
Policy towards foreign investment 2023-24: Policy uncertainty stemming from back-to-back elections in 2023 and 2025 deters private foreign investment.
2025-27: Mining investment picks up; investment in other sectors grows slowly, but inadequate property rights protection and questions surrounding access to foreign arbitration are deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2023-24: Next legislature ratifies free-trade agreement (FTA) with China, boosting non-oil exports.
2025-27: New trade barriers likely as left-wing government seeks to protect domestic production. Mining exports grow.
Taxes 2023-24: Still-high (albeit falling) global oil prices reduce likelihood of tax increases.
2025-27: Left-wing government advances new taxes on firms and wealthy Ecuadoreans. Tax system remains complex and evasion remains widespread, despite efforts to tackle these issues.
Financing 2023-24: Reduced liquidity in the financial system causes lending rates to rise, limiting access to financing for riskier firms.
2025-27: Public-sector financing grows to meet rising debt repayments, curbing long-term lending to private sector.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. Three presidents have been ousted by popular protests amid economic shocks since 1997. Ecuador's longest-serving president, the left-wing Rafael Correa (2007-17), was succeeded by Lenín Moreno (2017-21), who introduced a series of constitutional reforms, including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for presidents. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, the current president, Guillermo Lasso, who took office in May 2021, has faced significant social and fiscal challenges.
Political structure: Ecuador has a presidential system. The president and the 137 members of the unicameral National Assembly are elected for four-year terms, with a two-term limit. The 2008 constitution increased executive power and allowed the president to fast-track economic legislation, but a fragmented political landscape and the latent threat of widespread protests severely hinder governability. Although it is formally independent, the judiciary is politicised.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided a degree of macroeconomic stability but has also exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitiveness and has not precluded fiscal imbalances. Indeed, Ecuador struggled when the end of the commodity supercycle triggered a sharp decline in government revenue just when spending was at a record high. Covid-19 raised the imperative to strengthen the public finances; in 2020 the Moreno government secured a US$6.5bn extended fund facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF that aimed to support fiscal consolidation and structural reform, and which the Lasso administration successfully completed. Recent consolidation efforts and a rise in oil prices have shored up the fiscal accounts, but social spending pressures could still threaten long-term sustainability. The government increased fuel subsidies last year in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and domestic protests. They are a particularly heavy fiscal burden, but there is strong social and political opposition to removing them.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded a trade surplus of US$2.5bn in 2022; petrol export earnings averaged 35% of total export revenue, compared with more than 50% during the commodity boom in the 2000s.

Outlook for 2023-27: Political stability EIU expects Ecuador's political landscape to be volatile in the short term; the country is preparing for two general elections in less than two years (in 2023 and 2025), auguring substantial policy shifts. The first election, scheduled for August, was triggered in May, when the president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party, dissolved the unicameral National Assembly (the constitution allows presidents to do so once per term), in a bid to avoid an impeachment vote. The dissolution has improved political stability and governability in the short term; until a new National Assembly takes over in November or December, the executive branch can rule on urgent economic matters by decree (albeit subject to stringent legal review by the Constitutional Court). However, soaring crime rates and an economic slowdown will continue to erode Mr Lasso's already-weak political standing.
Substantial political and policy shifts are likely after the snap election in August. Mr Lasso will not stand, presumably because he is unpopular and would perform poorly. Although the abbreviated campaign is only just beginning, we expect Ecuadorean politics to shift to the left. Specifically, we think that the hard-left correísta movement that was forged by a populist former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), will regain the presidency.
The next government will face multiple challenges: a fragmented and fractious legislature, slow economic growth and a need to secure external financing. Given that this is an "extraordinary election", the winner will only serve until May 2025, when the current four-year governing period ends. Another general election will then be required, heralding yet more uncertainty. This will give Mr Lasso's successor very little time to consolidate their administration-let alone advance a reform agenda-meaning that they will be preoccupied with strengthening their prospects for re-election in 2025.
The opposition-within and beyond the legislature-will also be focused on the 2025 polls. This will make the 2023-25 term a long electoral campaign, encouraging politicians to adopt a populist stance, to the detriment of political stability. Whoever wins in 2025, we believe that Ecuador's ineffective institutions, fragmented party system and well-organised social movements that are capable of causing destabilising social unrest will sustain challenges to political instability and governability. In this scenario, there is a high risk of fresh political crises breaking out, including new dissolutions of the legislature or early presidential departures. A slide back into authoritarianism is another risk, particularly if correísmo returns to power.
Outlook for 2023-27: Election watch A snap general election will be held in August. The election outlook is highly uncertain, as the electoral authorities could still reject candidacies that do not comply with their requirements. Our initial view is that widespread disapproval of and disappointment in Mr Lasso-Ecuador's first markedly business-friendly president in decades-will precipitate a return to leftist politics. Against this backdrop, the correísta opposition, which lost out in the second round of the 2021 election, will have a solid basis from which to mount a presidential campaign, particularly following victories in regional and provincial elections in February. The correístas will also benefit from their organisational strength-a notable advantage, given the extremely short time in which to organise the campaign-and the fact that they have been the main opposition to the unpopular incumbent. We expect that Revolución Ciudadana (RC, the current correísta party) will perform well, securing the most seats in the legislature (but falling short of a majority), and that Luisa González, a proxy candidate for Mr Correa (who cannot run again, owing to re-election limits), will win the presidency.
However, given our view that the RC is unlikely to win the presidency in the first round, we note a high risk that Ms González will lose in the second-round run-off if opposition to correísmo soars, as occurred in 2021. We believe that there are two presidential contenders who could benefit significantly from this scenario. One is Jan Topic, a right-of-centre candidate who is seeking to capitalise on voters' discontent with soaring insecurity by running on a tough-on-crime platform. The other is Yaku Pérez, an indigenous rights and environmental activist whom Mr Lasso edged out in the first round in 2021; he could do well if he can build a broad coalition of disaffected centrist and leftist voters.
Outlook for 2023-27: International relations Mr Lasso has actively pursued trade liberalisation and will leave office having signed two new free-trade agreements (FTAs), with China and Costa Rica, although these will need to be ratified by the new legislature. He has also advanced negotiations with South Korea and Canada, and has submitted an application for Ecuador to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, a free-trade bloc). Assuming that a leftist administration takes over, we expect it to put most FTA efforts on the back burner, although the legislature is still likely to ratify the deal with China, partly owing to an ideological affinity, and partly because it will benefit a broad base of voters. In fact, we expect that the new left-wing government will try to deepen ties with China (partly to seek bilateral financing) and that Ecuador's relations with the US, which have improved greatly under Mr Lasso, will cool.
Outlook for 2023-27: Policy trends Mr Lasso's dissolution of the legislature in May has upended the outlook for economic policy. Given that so much depends on the outcome of the 2023 and 2025 elections, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding our forecasts. Overall, however, we expect that Mr Lasso's market-friendly agenda will give way to more populist, fiscally expansionary policies, partly because the back-to-back elections will put politicians across the spectrum into campaign mode, and partly because of our assumption that politics will shift towards the left.
In the short term, we expect Mr Lasso to try to leverage his new executive powers to build a legacy before leaving office. To that end, we expect him to pursue two types of policies. One type will be market-friendly reforms aimed at attracting private investment and tightening fiscal and monetary discipline, some of which were blocked by the legislature. Specifically, we expect him to issue decrees to boost Ecuador's underdeveloped capital markets and to prevent the next administration from using foreign-exchange reserves held by the Banco Central de Ecuador (BCE, the central bank) and social security institutions to finance public spending. However, we expect progress to be piecemeal, given that the Constitutional Court, which must approve his executive decrees, will not give him free rein on major reforms while the legislature is out of action. As a case in point, the Constitutional Court recently overturned a decree to provide tax benefits for special economic zones, arguing that it was not urgently needed and therefore did not fulfil a legal requisite for decrees passed while the legislature is dissolved.
The second type of policy will have a more populist bent, as Mr Lasso will seek to buoy his standing with citizens before leaving office. He has recently enacted a tax reform to reduce tax payments for the middle class-an important voter base. Along similar lines, we expect social spending to rise in the months ahead.
Assuming that Ms González becomes the next president, and given that her truncated term will make her particularly keen to secure re-election in 2025, we expect her to pursue policies aimed at bolstering public support, including raising social spending. There will be a high risk of populist reforms that erase improvements to the business environment that were made under Mr Lasso, although legislative fragmentation is likely to prevent her government from implementing its most radical hard-left policies.
There is even greater uncertainty around policy trends after the 2025 election, as much will depend on the performance of the administration that governs in 2023-25. Our baseline scenario is that the left will retain power and that fiscal policy will remain expansionary, although an increasing debt amortisation schedule is likely to force some spending restraint. A right-of-centre president could feasibly be elected in 2025 if the 2023-25 administration is unpopular. Even in this scenario, however, we are sceptical that major market-friendly reforms would advance, given the slow progress under Mr Lasso and the structural deficiencies of Ecuador's political system, which will undoubtedly endure.
Outlook for 2023-27: Fiscal policy The most important legacy of Mr Lasso's administration will be substantial fiscal consolidation under a US$6.5bn extended fund facility (EFF) agreement with the IMF. As a result of the programme, which ran from 2020 to 2022, the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit narrowed from 1.7% of GDP in 2021 to 0.2% of GDP in 2022 (although high oil prices and expenditure cuts initiated by Mr Lasso's predecessor, Lenín Moreno, contributed significantly). However, we believe that this consolidation trend is over. Lower oil prices will weigh on government revenue, as will a recent reform that reduces personal income tax (the Lasso administration will attempt to plug the gap by cutting tax benefits for firms, but political pressure may prevent this). Moreover, social pressures have caused public expenditure to rise. These factors, along with an anticipated shift towards leftist politics and budget rigidities, will cause the fiscal deficit to widen to 0.9% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the deficit to expand again in 2024 as the next government steps up spending in order to consolidate its position ahead of the 2025 election. Budget rigidities-in the shape of court-mandated increases to the health and education budgets, and automatic pay rises for public officials-will also contribute to the wider deficit. On the revenue side, no additional taxes are likely, although growing mining exports should help to offset a fall in oil revenue (as global oil prices continue to ease), precluding an even wider deficit. We therefore expect the public debt/GDP ratio to remain stable, closing the forecast period at 56%.
High electoral uncertainty means that our assumptions are subject to substantial risk. We do not currently expect a return to the kind of macroeconomic heterodoxy that caused the fiscal deficit and public debt to swell in 2012-15 (around the end of the commodity supercycle) and laid the ground for a debt default in 2020 amid the pandemic-driven recession. The external environment and Ecuador's macroeconomic position are now much less supportive than they were in the 2000s, which will constrain the scope for the sort of state-led investment that Mr Correa was able to undertake. Additionally, debt repayments to the Fund will rise significantly from 2025; this will encourage the next two administrations to secure a new deal (which would involve some level of fiscal restraint) in order to avoid a new default and another economic crisis. However, we cannot discount the possibility that a correísta administration is much more fiscally irresponsible than we anticipate and threatens to suspend external debt payments during negotiations on a more manageable repayment schedule, or that it eventually follows through on this threat.
Outlook for 2023-27: Monetary policy As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy, which limits the levers that the authorities can pull to support growth. Monetary conditions will therefore depend largely on external factors, particularly the stance taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank), which we expect to hold rates for the rest of 2023, following aggressive tightening, before embarking on an easing cycle in 2024. However, Ecuador's high risk premium and falling liquidity in its financial system will keep real local rates elevated.
If Ms González is elected in August, there is a risk that she will attempt to revert the BCE's (recently restored) independence and force it to use international reserves to finance public spending. This would threaten monetary and financial stability, as it would increase liquidity risks and could ultimately jeopardise the dollarisation regime.
Outlook for 2023-27: Economic growth Electoral uncertainty will compound an ongoing economic slowdown and, assuming that the left takes power in August, we expect private investment to weaken. We forecast that real GDP growth will slow sharply this year, to 1.6%, from 2.9% in 2022. The electoral cycle will increase risk aversion; this, along with rising domestic interest rates, will cause businesses to halt investment plans. This slowdown in investment will weigh on private consumption, as will a softening of remittances amid a downturn in advanced economies. The external balance will remain a drag on growth as oil exports stagnate and an economic slowdown in the US and Europe curbs demand for Ecuador's goods.
The economy will struggle to regain momentum in 2024-27, growing by an annual average of 2.2%. Electoral uncertainty will weigh on private investment, keeping the post-pandemic pick-up slow (the economy will only return to its 2019 in 2023). Real wage growth will remain weak, constraining private consumption. Meanwhile, government consumption and investment will accelerate, but the state will simply lack the resources to spur growth significantly. Although export growth will strengthen towards the end of the forecast period, driven by mining and other non-oil shipments, high demand for the imported materials needed for capital investment will mean that the external account makes a negative contribution to growth for most of 2024-27.
The biggest downside risk to our GDP forecast is that the domestic political environment proves more unstable than we currently anticipate. This would weigh even more heavily on private investment and could lead to fiscally unsustainable policymaking that provides a short-term boost to GDP but eventually triggers a severe crisis.
Outlook for 2023-27: Inflation Twelve-month consumer price inflation will slow from 3.7% in December 2022 to 1.2% at end-2023. Supply-side pressures that built up during the pandemic and intensified following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war are easing as global demand cools and supply chains are repaired. Fuel subsidies are also reducing price pressures. Inflation could come in above our expectations if there are shocks to global commodity prices, or if the El Niño weather phenomenon (which tends to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to Ecuador) disrupts food production. Looking ahead, we expect global commodity prices to continue to fall and dollarisation to remain in place, causing inflation to moderate to an average of 1.9% per year in 2024-27.
Outlook for 2023-27: Exchange rates We expect dollarisation to be maintained in 2023-27, as there is widespread popular support for the exchange-rate regime, on the basis that it promotes macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, the correístas have in the past criticised dollarisation and have advocated for its elimination; if they win in August, there is a risk that the next administration will draw on the BCE's international reserves. Moreover, the fact that Ecuador's high risk premium prevents it from tapping international capital markets will sustain financing and liquidity concerns, particularly in 2026-27, when debt repayments will rise significantly. However, a left-wing administration may be able to access new financing from China, which would help to assuage these concerns (we have not yet pencilled this kind of financing into our forecasts).
Outlook for 2023-27: External sector We are cautiously optimistic about the external accounts in 2023-27 and expect a series of current-account surpluses. Export growth, still-high oil prices and a slowdown in import growth should support the trade balance in 2023, contributing to an overall current-account surplus of 1.1% of GDP. After eroding in 2024-26 as lower global prices cause oil receipts to fall, the current-account surplus will increase in 2027, buoyed by rising mining exports. Current-account surpluses and multilateral financing will bolster the BCE's foreign-exchange reserves (assuming that the next administration does not tap these), providing a cushion against fiscal and financial shocks. We expect reserves to rise to 3.4 months of import cover by end-2027, from an average of 1.8 months in 2010-20. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are likely to be weak in 2023-27, averaging just 0.6% of GDP, as investors will remain wary of a return to statist policies. FDI that does arrive will be concentrated in extractive industries.
