Country Forecast Turkey April 2019 Updater

https://www.proquest.com/reports/country-forecast-turkey-april-2019-updater/docview/2214667964/se-2?accountid=14357

Abstract: [...]of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 2.9% of GDP. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. [...]a deterioration in relations could put at risk Turkey´s control of territory across the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. [...]after decelerating to 2.8% in 2018, we expect that GDP will contract by 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects).

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Mr Erdogan and the AKP will remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and probably beyond.
Following the 2018 elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016 there has been a deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will continue to be tense. Points of contention include Turkey's perceived pivot towards Iran and Russia and, from Turkey's perspective, the lack of support from the US after the failed coup.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. In the coming years, with no scheduled elections until 2023, we expect the amount of policymaking focused on short-term growth to be more limited.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to an average of about 2.6% per year in 2019-23, reflecting the impact of the August 2018 currency crisis, higher domestic and international interest rates, a persistently difficult business environment and global trade tensions.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.4:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 2.9% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22 in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled an estimated US$175bn and imports about US$216bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$41.8bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$27.2bn (or 3.6% of estimated GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote with a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections took place on March 31st. The AKP and the MHP retained a majority of the national vote. However, in the midst of an economic recession the ruling parties lost vital cities such as Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city (still being contested). Losing major cities is a blow to the AKP given the public resources that the cities command. However, Mr Erdogan's tight grip on national institutions and the media mean that he will continue to dominate Turkish politics in the coming years.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign-policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic. We do not expect a breakdown in relations, but there is an elevated risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; and US sanctions on Turkish officials owing to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October 2018).
In 2019 relations with the US will continue to be tested owing to Turkey´s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 missile defence system. The decision puts Turkey at risk of being excluded from the ongoing development of the F-35 fighter jet programme and of facing economic sanctions under the US Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). We expect that Turkey and the US will find a solution that enables Turkey to obtain a waiver from US sanctions or avoid them altogether. With the economy in recession, Turkey can ill afford the cost of sanctions. The US is unlikely to want to pursue a course of action that would lead to a strengthening of Turkey-Russia ties and potentially set the stage for a complete collapse in US-Turkey relations.
We do not expect Turkey to back down from the purchase, given the effect that it would have on its relationship with Russia, a necessary partner in neighbouring Syria. Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, and maintains a large military presence in the country. Thus, a deterioration in relations could put at risk Turkey´s control of territory across the border region, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River-territory that was gained to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK along the border. It could also limit Turkey´s influence in Idlib, a city in northern Syria, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups. In September 2018 an agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran was reached to forestall a regime offensive against Idlib. Such an offensive could result in another surge of refugee flows into Turkey.
Relations between Turkey and the EU will also remain transactional, as both have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU was to suspend Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to NATO forces or withdrew from NATO altogether.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles, and foreign policy challenges, has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector.
After local elections in March 2019 Turkey's political landscape enters a period of electoral calm that-barring any unforeseen events-should last for several years, until the next parliamentary and presidential elections (due in 2023). This context of relative political stability should put the AKP in a position to take a more long-term approach to policymaking. Compared with the past three years, it should also limit the amount of ad hoc policy measures that boost the economy in the near term, but that diminish the government's credibility. However, an element of unpredictability and unorthodoxy will remain in the near term. The economy is in recession and, following its recent poor performance in local elections, the AKP will continue to feel under pressure to support growth. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate), and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in the 2019-23 forecast period.
In the case of a banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia has tensions. Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Only China appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey (perhaps as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax rises in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits caused the deficit to widen in 2018-to 2% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy. This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% of GDP in 2023.
The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.9% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), in the context of economic turmoil after the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to about 26.5% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is currently above the main policy rate, however. The bank is providing funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% greater than the one-week repo rate.
At its meeting on March 6th the MPC kept its one-week repo lending rate unchanged, at 24%. We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that the central bank will continue to overshoot its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
After quarterly growth of 0.2% in the second quarter of 2018, GDP contracted by 1.3% in the third quarter and by 3.3% in the fourth quarter. High-frequency indicators until February 2019 (latest available data) suggest that in the first quarter of the year the deterioration in economic activity was contained. However, this was probably the result of stimulus ahead of the local elections in March, and we do not expect a sustained recovery in economic activity until the end of 2019. As a result, after decelerating to 2.8% in 2018, we expect that GDP will contract by 1.7% in 2019 on average (mainly owing to base effects).
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 4.1% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.6% per year. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts; these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices drove inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a limited depreciation of the lira (against the US dollar), a lower average global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2018 will prevent inflation from declining faster than would otherwise be the case. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.1% in 2019-only marginally smaller than the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 10.2% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy, with the US entering a technical recession) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of the year. In the first months of 2019 the lira has again depreciated against the US dollar owing to political uncertainty and polarising campaign rhetoric around the March local elections, declining central bank foreign-exchange reserves and the re-emergence of tensions with the US-this time owing to Turkey´s purchase of the Russian-made defence system.
Having again reached TL5.80:US$1 in mid-April, we expect a gradual appreciation from this level in the second half of the year, and a year-end exchange rate of about TL:5.70:US$1. This forecast rests on our expectation that Turkey and the US will resolve their dispute, that government policy will be credibly reoriented, and that the central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy stance, lowering interest rates only as price pressures fade. There are large risks to this forecast, both in terms of probability and impact. If any of our expectations do not materialise, the lira could again depreciate substantially.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to depreciate as the current-account deficit widens and as central banks in advanced economies re-embark on a path of monetary policy tightening. Thereafter still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although not as large as that in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.4:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP narrowed in 2018, to 3.6%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar depressed imports (owing to a decline in domestic demand) and boosted export competitiveness.
In 2019-23 we expect an average annual current-account deficit of about 2.9% of GDP. We expect a further contraction in the deficit in 2019 given the weak economic conditions and only a gradual widening thereafter. The deficit will remain contained (by historical standards) owing to significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Abstract: The nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which is fundamentally opposed by the provincial government in British Columbia (BC), has raised questions over federal jurisdiction. [...]on April 1st the Trudeau administration imposed a carbon tax in four provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. Since the October 2015 general election, the opposition parties have been in transition. According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. [...]the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October 2019 election, but fallout from the controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case means that the result will be tighter than previously envisaged.
The renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced trade uncertainty, although the new agreement has yet to be ratified. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its key export market.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the planned carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. We expect it to keep rates on hold in 2019-20, owing to the weaker economy and housing market, and the benign outlook for inflation. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue in 2022-23.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7% in 2019, from 2.2% in 2018, reflecting generally lower oil prices. Inflationary pressures will ease further in 2020, in line with a weaker economy, before picking up again from 2021 as economic growth regains some momentum.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.8% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019 and to 1.5% in 2020 as private consumption growth moderates and an economic slowdown in the US dampens export demand. Real GDP growth will average 2% per year in 2021-23.

Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.
2021-23: The government completes its update of financial legislation, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
The labour market
2019-20: Canada will enact policies to streamline processes and increase quotas to expedite the hiring of foreign talent by companies.
2021-23: The government further encourages the entry of skilled workers and professionals by raising its immigration target.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Plans to construct new oil pipelines from Alberta progress slowly, as the projects face opposition from environmental groups.
2021-23: After years of uncertainty, pipelines to carry energy resources from Alberta begin to come on stream.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The technology sector benefits from workers moving from the US, especially those on that country's H1B visas, for whom the political climate becomes more difficult.
2021-23: Expertise in artificial intelligence takes root, particularly in the academic centres of Toronto and Montreal.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: The Canadian economy was the ninth-largest in the world in 2017 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 76% of its goods exports and is the source of about 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue, just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French-speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the main parties in contention to lead the provincial government after the 2018 election is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party heads a majority government since winning the general election in 2015.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. As at 2019 the top federal income-tax rate, on taxable income above C$210,371 (US$157,300), was 33%.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$16.6bn in 2018 and the current-account deficit was US$45.5bn (2.7% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau, has shifted Canadian politics to the left since it won a majority at the 2015 election. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects challenges to policy initiatives and friction with provincial administrations to intensify ahead of the next federal election, due in October 2019. The ongoing controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case also risks tarnishing Mr Trudeau's political brand.
The political scandal centres on allegations by the former attorney-general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, that Mr Trudeau and his officials put inappropriate political pressure on her to abandon the criminal prosecution for fraud of SNC-Lavalin, a large Quebec-based construction and engineering firm. The saga took a new turn on March 29th when Ms Wilson-Raybould provided the parliamentary justice committee with a secret recording of a telephone conversation between herself and the clerk of the Privy Council, from December 2018. In that conversation the clerk highlighted the prime minister's concerns about the damaging impact of a prosecution on SNC-Lavalin, continuing a debate that had been under way internally for months about the option of proceeding under a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have let the company off with a fine. Ms Wilson-Raybould refused to intervene and the company faces the prospect of a trial.
The secret taping angered many Liberal members of parliament, who believed that it was time for Mr Trudeau to act, after weeks of him and other Liberals trying to broker a compromise with Ms Wilson-Raybould. She had quit the cabinet in February. Another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, followed suit in March. Citing the unwillingness of the pair to state that they had confidence in him and his government, Mr Trudeau expelled them from caucus on April 2nd and indicated that they could not run as Liberals in the federal election. Just as it seemed that the Liberals had drawn a line under the issue, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer, revealed on April 7th that he had received a letter from Mr Trudeau's lawyer, threatening to sue him for libel over his comments relating to Mr Trudeau's role in the controversy. The affair is likely to result in further political fallout for the government and give added momentum to the Conservatives in the lead-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments will intensify. The nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which is fundamentally opposed by the provincial government in British Columbia (BC), has raised questions over federal jurisdiction. Moreover, on April 1st the Trudeau administration imposed a carbon tax in four provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. However, broad agreement on 75:25 cannabis tax revenue-sharing between provincial administrations and the federal government, which came into effect in October 2018, together with the renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has helped to ease trade uncertainty, should help to limit tensions.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Political fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair has seen the Conservatives edge ahead of the Liberals in opinion polls since February. However, we still expect the Liberal Party to form the government after the federal election due by October 2019. This reflects the advantages of incumbency, its recent successes on international trade policy, the legalisation of cannabis and decrying Saudi actions towards human rights. Since the October 2015 general election, the opposition parties have been in transition. The Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and are building momentum under Mr Scheer. They will be further boosted by the United Conservative Party's defeat of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) government in the Alberta provincial election on April 16th. At the federal level, the Conservatives will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes and government spending. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing 40,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum. The profile of the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, will be lifted by his election to parliament in February. However, the NDP trails well behind the two larger parties in terms of fundraising ahead of the election. The Conservatives are in the best shape in this regard.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Under the Liberals, Canadian foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. This is in clear contrast to the policies pursued by Donald Trump's administration in the US. As a result, bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration. Canada will, nonetheless, seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far. Where possible, Canada will attempt to circumvent the White House by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The successful negotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA and preserve the trilateral arrangement, mitigates significant trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier US-Mexico deal. In particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which Canada relies on to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. The new deal grants the US greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are also managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). This concession is broadly similar to what Canada had offered during negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, from which the US withdrew in 2017. In another move that should ease regional trade tension, Canada negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports. The new agreement was signed in November 2018 but is awaiting ratification by the three governments, and there is a significant risk of delay from the US side.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to key Asian markets over the forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines. With full implementation, the figure is set to rise to 99%.
China was a key target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities. Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. On March 1st the Canadian government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition, and shortly afterwards China blocked canola (rapeseed) imports from two Canadian canola producers, on the grounds of biosecurity concerns. We expect tensions to persist throughout 2019, preventing progress on exploratory free-trade talks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Canada will continue supporting domestic industries that are negatively affected by US trade protectionism. In 2018 the finance minister, Bill Morneau, announced measures to increase the competitiveness of Canadian businesses after the introduction of tax cuts in the US at the start of last year. These included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. Environmental policy will also be important in the remainder of the parliamentary term. Government support for the fossil fuel industry is crucial for economic growth in the short to medium term but appears incompatible with the federal government's green credentials. The Liberal Party will continue to seek a balance between these two objectives to preserve its voter base. On the one hand, the government has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20/tonne (US$15/tonne) in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. The federal tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. However, the consensus on taxing carbon emissions seems to be weakening as opposition mounts. On the other hand, the government seems likely to approve (in June) the construction of the controversial Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline, designed to enable higher volumes of crude oil from Alberta to be transported to a port in BC. Additional major investments are being undertaken to develop Canada's natural resources.
Policymakers will continue to keep a close eye on the property market, which remains a key risk owing to recent monetary policy tightening and overleveraged Canadian households. Following the imposition of tighter mortgage-lending requirements since 2016, the market appears to be rebalancing as the quality of new mortgage lending improves. Price growth has slowed markedly, with some measures showing a dip in house prices in late 2018/early 2019, although trends vary across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but this will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the expected introduction of a cap-and-trade system and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018 will weigh on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit, as increased government support will be expected to shore up the economy and government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down on March 19th, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.8bn), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. This is broadly unchanged from the Fall Economic Statement (FES, the mid-year budget update), published in November 2018. Official projections show the budget deficit declining to C$9.8bn, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, by 2023/24. Following the budget, we have trimmed our budget deficit projections across the forecast period (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based). We now estimate that the fiscal deficit stood at 0.9% of GDP in 2018, and expect it to expand slightly, to 1.1% of GDP, in 2019 as the government looks to support the fossil fuels industry through rebates and additional incentives amid a softer price environment. In 2020 the government will respond to an economic slowdown with additional fiscal spending, which will push the deficit up to 1.3% of GDP; however, we expect the slowdown to be short-lived. The government will look to narrow the deficit in the longer term, and we expect it to fall gradually, to 0.8% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points between July 2017 and October 2018, in response to rising inflation and tightening monetary policy in the US. However, the BoC proceeded more cautiously than the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank), and the Canadian policy rate has remained below its US equivalent-an unusual situation. The BoC had been on course to raise its policy rate, currently 1.75%, to what it considers to be a more normal range of between 2.5% and 3.5%. This reflects concern that prolonging the period of low interest rates would` encourage households to increase their borrowing, adding to near-record levels of household debt as a proportion of disposable income. However, the BoC kept monetary tightening on hold at its past three meetings, owing in part to lower energy prices, which pushed down the headline inflation rate.
Given the benign outlook for inflation, weak household spending growth, the softening housing market and signs of weaker economic momentum in the US, we now expect the BoC to leave the policy rate unchanged in 2019. We previously forecast that it would increase rates by 25 basis points this year. We continue to expect that the BoC will keep rates on hold in 2020, when the US enters a cyclical slowdown, which, because of the two countries' interlinkages, will cause economic growth in Canada to slow. Modest monetary tightening will resume in 2021 and continue for the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to 1.8% in 2018, from 3% in 2017. This reflected weaker growth in most GDP components, notably private consumption and business investment, although export growth picked up. We expect real GDP growth to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. Monetary tightening and high household debt levels will dampen private consumption growth this year, and export growth is also expected to moderate, as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's key export market.
Much of 2018 was characterised by the escalating trade dispute with the US. The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the key downside risks to our forecast, although the agreement has yet to be ratified, and the steel and aluminium tariffs imposed on Canada by the US in 2018 remain in place for now. Other risks to the economic outlook include a renewed drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
Real GDP growth will slow further in 2020, to 1.5%, as the US enters a cyclical downturn. Economic expansion in Canada is expected to pick up again in 2021, and real GDP growth will average 2.1% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued government spending on infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices until October 2018 and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures for much of 2018, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation picked up to an average of 2.2%. The headline inflation rate fell back to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, below the BoC's 2% target rate, owing to lower petrol prices, although core inflation was 1.9%. We expect the headline inflation rate to average a benign 1.7% in 2019, reflecting the lagged effect of previous monetary tightening by the central bank, slowing export demand and generally lower oil prices. The mild economic slowdown in 2020 will lead to a further easing in the inflation rate next year, before it picks up again from 2021 as the economy strengthens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Tighter monetary policy, a broader improvement in the global economy and the draining of the surplus in the oil market lent support to the Canadian dollar in the first half of 2018, although falling oil prices have weighed on the currency in recent months. We expect the Canadian dollar to depreciate further against its US counterpart, from a full-year average of C$1.30:US$1 in 2018 to C$1.35:US$1 in 2019 and C$1.38:US$1 in 2020, reflecting weaker global oil prices, softer economic growth and a more dovish approach from the BoC, which we now expect will leave its policy rate unchanged in 2019. A pick-up in growth from 2021, and the resumption of monetary tightening, will underpin an appreciation in the Canadian dollar over the remainder of the forecast period, with the currency forecast to average C$1.28:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which we expect will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.7% of GDP during this period. The CPTPP, the effects of which will first be felt at the start of the next decade, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. We expect that this will help to narrow the current-account deficit to 2.4% of GDP in 2023.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly. [...]that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. [...]we expect limited real investment inflows, with the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. [...]power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have significantly further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The head of the ruling regime, Nicolás Maduro, and his party, the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), are under intense political and economic pressure. Under The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast, we expect regime pragmatists to oust Mr Maduro and form a government with Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who has declared himself interim president and who is openly offering regime pragmatists a series of benefits (amnesty, international financing, a transitional government, lifting of sanctions) that Mr Maduro can no longer credibly promise. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
Following years-long economic collapse, GDP will continue to contract in 2019-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. Following our forecast transition this year, a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
The recession that began in 2014 has devolved into a hyperinflationary crisis and will continue to deepen in the short term. The economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, the worst position in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$22.3bn in 2018 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 4.1% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that a national unity government composed of opposition and regime "pragmatists" will form a transitional administration later in 2019. The transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
On January 23rd the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president and was swiftly recognised by most Western nations as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Mr Guaidó has re-energised a disillusioned population, allowing him to convoke massive demonstrations, sowing concerns among regime members of country-wide unrest at a time when dissatisfaction within the military's lower ranks is at an all-time high. More crucially, Mr Guaidó secured US sanctions on oil trade conducted by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. Prior to this the US was the destination of around 40% of Venezuelan exports, PDVSA's largest cash-paying client and a key source of production inputs. All of this translates to a severe blow to the patronage flows underpinning the regime's internal stability. In an effort to regain some control, the regime recently stripped Mr Guaidó's of his parliamentary immunity and jailed his chief of staff. Nevertheless, we believe that the regime would draw the line at arresting Mr Guaidó, as it would prompt sizeable unrest and international backlash.
Mr Guaidó is presenting his leadership as a path out of the current quagmire for dissatisfied regime members. He has repeatedly called for the military to depose Mr Maduro, offering the lifting of oil sanctions, the arrival of international aid and financing, and amnesty for defectors. Overall, considering that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, which Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee, we expect that pragmatists within the regime will eventually side-line or expel "hardliners" in exchange for influence in Mr Guaidó's more prosperous government.
A Guaidó-led transition government is our baseline forecast; however, such an administration would face considerable hurdles and it is unclear how much muscle the opposition would have in a power-sharing transitional government. If opposition figures cannot deliver on its promises quickly enough, the government could well collapse, given the challenging tasks ahead. These include securing debt relief; rebuilding the rule of law; and attracting tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment. Through all this, the opposition would need to be careful to not upset its partners. Most of the opposition's economic rationalisation plans require reforms that eliminate the economy's distortions, closing the avenues for corruption and enrichment that regime members have used for years.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. Firstly, that regime pragmatists will have enough capacity to overpower hardliners who would rather rule a ruined country than share a prosperous one. Years of economic malaise and failed dialogues have been insufficient to prompt regime change in itself, and, the military-a key powerbroker-remains behind Mr Maduro despite repeated rumours to the contrary. Secondly, that regime members will deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a unity government is a continued lack of hard-currency to sustain the patronage system. The main risk to this assumption comes from the possibility that Russia or China, erstwhile financiers, would bail out the regime. This is not our baseline forecast, but Venezuela's oil wealth remains a draw. Another risk to our assumptions around the regime's access to hard currency centres on transnational crime and the informal export of precious metals, and whether these enterprises could be enough to make up the lost revenue from oil exports.
Given the very high risks to our baseline view, there are several alternate scenarios, with varying probabilities. Our main alternate scenarios are the following (in order of likelihood): Firstly, a continuation of the PSUV's authoritarian rule (with or without Mr Maduro). Secondly, a complete collapse of the regime followed by an opposition-led government. Lastly, prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict-if divisions within the regime become clearer but no faction gains outright control of the state apparatus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. As we currently expect such a government to coalesce within 2019, we expect elections at some point in 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled hitherto unexpected levels of support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised Mr Guaidó. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative currently lacks international legitimacy. However, the US administration has sunk considerable political capital into Mr Guaidó and smaller-scale interventions, such as targeted bombings, are a possibility, especially given that the US no longer has substantial economic sanctions to throw at the regime. Such action, however, is not included in our baseline forecasts.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in actual investment. Despite dealing with US sanctions, Russia recently sent a limited number of military personnel to Caracas, the capital, which will further antagonise its relations with the US. Nevertheless, we believe that both Russia and China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt at protecting their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we foresee no fundamental change in policy by the Maduro regime, which remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. Any efforts to tackle these issues have been self-defeating, and so imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of any government will depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. Hardliners would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. Thus, we expect limited real investment inflows, with the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect that the fiscal deficit this year will be close to double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) and leased facilities in the Caribbean. So far, Venezuela has taken a defensive stance, treating each claim individually and stalling as much as possible before complying when seizures seem imminent. Given PDVSA's extremely strained financial situation and the lack of further sources of financing, the strategy seems unsustainable.
Following sanctions on January 28th, the US government now considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but it is unclear how much power Mr Guaidó will have over the company. The regime now has little incentive to defend Citgo from creditors, and it is also it is unclear if creditors could even claim it. PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure on Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 75% month on month in February. By end-January Venezuela had significantly raised reserve requirements for the banking sector, which "contained" hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise somewhat in short term. But this is a one-off effect; hyperinflation and significant currency depreciation will return in April. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 60% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts are now very common-a result of severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure-and have significantly further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 900,000 barrels/day (b/d) over the coming quarters, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. But until US sanctions on oil are lifted, margins will be smaller, as PDVSA has lost access to its closest and better-paying market. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2023) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 54% in February. In the context of a projected macroeconomic stabilisation plan later in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast of a political transition later in 2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is highly likely. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devalued the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. At end-March the official rate stood at BsS3,300:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of over BsS3,700:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect a small current-account deficit in 2019, buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus to a deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2023.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure enough finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic transition administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Russia--highlights: Political outlook
Support for the president, Vladimir Putin, remains high. Modest economic performance and real cuts to government spending could lead to social discontent, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that this will remain contained. The opposition has been marginalised, and the likelihood of a political transition appears low. Mr Putin and his government face a long-term challenge of elite renewal that will be compounded by weak economic growth, although international sanctions provide an excuse for domestic economic failings. The authorities have turned to nationalism as a source of legitimation, but this is an unreliable and unpredictable mechanism for social control.

Tensions with the West, and especially the US, have dampened the business environment outlook. We expect US and EU sanctions, as well as Russian counter-sanctions, to remain in place in the medium term. Poor relations with the West have increased the risks to foreign companies operating in Russia. Capital controls are unlikely, but remain possible in the case of a severe financial crisis (for instance if global oil prices drop sharply-not our core scenario). The gains made by Russia's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) now look to be under threat as a result of increasing protectionism. Long-standing weaknesses of the investment environment will persist. Increased state intervention is likely to be mixed with market-oriented policies in some areas. There will be some measures to attract (mostly non-Western) foreign investment, such as in energy projects that have special technological and capital needs, but western sanctions will constrain such steps.
Russia--highlights: Economic outlook

We forecast 1.5% GDP growth in 2019, a persistently feeble recovery from the recession in 2015-16. Government spending will continue to decline in real terms in the 2019-23 forecast period, possibly eroding the popularity of the government. In the medium term protectionist trends, the deficiencies of the banking sector, world financial sanctions and a poor investment profile will constrain growth potential. We forecast annual average growth of well below 2% in 2019-23. Barriers to faster medium-term growth include dependence on natural resources, a poor demographic outlook, the absence of a "culture of failure", low investment levels and a tricky business environment.
Russia--highlights: Demographic outlook

Population growth   0.5 -0.1
Working-age population growth   -0.3 -0.7
Labour force growth   0.2 -0.4
The population is forecast to decline over the forecast period and beyond, which is a significant impediment to growth prospects. Russia faces a demographic challenge resulting from low birth rates, low life expectancy (compared with Western countries) and an ageing population. The high rates of immigration that would be required to change the demographic profile are politically difficult. Outside low-skilled sectors, gaps in the labour market are expected to be tight, with implications for inflation and productivity. The ageing workforce will push up pension and healthcare costs significantly.

Russia is one of the largest markets in Europe in terms of population, but the devaluation and subsequent depreciation of the rouble (against the US dollar and the euro), and the recession in 2015-16, have cut the size of the economy and reduced consumer purchasing power in US dollar terms. Personal disposable incomes have started to recover, but income growth will be slower than in the pre-crisis period, and consumer sentiment remains subdued. There will be significant regional variation, with some urban centres, in particular Moscow, the capital, recording higher income and consumption growth rates.

Labour productivity growth 2.4 1.9 2.1
We forecast average real GDP growth and real GDP growth per head slightly less than 2% in 2019-50. An unfavourable demographic profile, a difficult business environment, a fragile banking system, poor policy-making, and overreliance on natural resources will place constraints on Russia's long-term growth. Given its strong industrial tradition, Russia's chances of diversifying its economy could be strong, but this potential is unlikely to be fully realised in the medium term, following a sharp deterioration in political and economic relations with the West and structurally low investment levels.

Background: The transition to a market economy in the early 1990s was accompanied by a collapse in industrial production and a sharp drop in living standards. A contested privatisation process led to a highly concentrated ownership structure. Executive weakness and bureaucratic dysfunction contributed to a sharp decentralisation of power. After becoming president in 2000, Vladimir Putin sought to restore central control over the regions and tame independent corporate interests. Mr Putin presided over a period of strong economic growth in his first two terms. His re-election as president in 2012 and 2018 heralded the development of a more authoritarian domestic environment.
Political structure: Boris Yeltsin won the first democratic presidential election in June 1991 and was re-elected in 1996. Repeated confrontations with the legislature culminated in the dissolution of parliament in 1993 and a violent showdown in the following month. The powers of the executive were greatly increased by a new constitution, adopted in 1993. Mr Putin was elected president in 2000 and re-elected for a second term in 2004. His second term in office was characterised by increasing centralisation of the state. A loyal ally, Dmitry Medvedev, won the presidential election in 2008 and took over in May of that year. Mr Putin returned to the presidency for a third term in 2012. Following a constitutional change, Mr Putin's third term lasted six years, to 2018. He was re-elected to a fourth term in March 2018.
Policy issues: During Mr Putin's third term as president greater emphasis was placed on conservative values, anti-Westernism and great-power nationalism. The stand-off with the West is leading to a rollback of Russia's integration into the world economy, and attempts to insulate the Russian economy from Western financial channels. This is likely to strengthen further the state's role in the economy. Tit-for-tat sanctions have encouraged the government to emphasise import substitution. The focus on curbing "foreign influence" on domestic politics is likely to endure, along with close controls on civil society, the internet and the media.
Taxation: Reforms since 2000 have aimed to rationalise the tax system and cut the number of taxes and the corporate tax burden. Changes to the tax regime in 2001 included the introduction of a flat rate of personal income tax of 13% and a simplification of the administration of social security contributions. The corporate tax rate was cut from 24% to 20% in 2009. In 2019 the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) rose from 18% to 20%.
Foreign trade: Mainly because of high international oil prices, export revenue has soared since 2000, except for dips during the global recession in 2009 and the collapse in oil prices in 2014-16. Import growth has picked up since 2000 as a result of rising real incomes and real rouble appreciation. Merchandise exports totalled US$444bn in 2018, and imports about US$249bn. Oil and gas account for about 60% of Russia's exports, with metals contributing a little more than 13%.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The president, Vladimir Putin, was re-elected for a fourth term in March 2018. He enjoys sweeping formal executive powers by virtue of the 1993 constitution and his concerted drive in his first presidential term to recentralise power. A preponderance of political powers is attached to the office of president, including command of the armed forces and the right to appoint most of the important posts in the executive and judiciary. Parliament does not have direct influence on the formation of the cabinet, but must approve the president's candidate for chairman of the government (prime minister). Following a reform in 2012, most regional heads are now directly elected, but the selection of candidates is subject to approval by local legislatures. This "presidential filter" allows the centre (Moscow, the capital) to exercise significant control.
Parliamentary forces: In the election to the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) on September 18th 2016 United Russia, the "party of power" that is effectively controlled from the presidential administration, gained a constitutional majority, winning 54.2% of the vote and 343 of the 450 seats in the Duma. Although United Russia gained almost 100 seats compared with the 238 that it won in the controversial election in late November 2011, the party claimed almost 4m fewer votes than in 2011, given the low turnout of 47.8%. The three nominal opposition parties-the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) and Just Russia-saw their share of seats fall significantly. The election result indicates that the government is continuing to marginalise all formal political opposition. More importantly, it avoided a repeat of the 2011 election, when an apparent decline in support for United Russia helped to galvanise mass protests.

Political outlook: Political stability
In March 2018 Vladimir Putin was re-elected as president for a fourth term. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects broad continuity in his policy agenda, which focuses on "conservative cultural values", an authoritarian political culture and overt anti­Westernism. This means ongoing confrontation with the US and the EU regarding Ukraine, and a continued muscular foreign policy. Despite some pro-market rhetoric, economic policy will remain statist, nationalist and protectionist. Mr Putin's term runs until 2024, but given how heavily the political system leans on his charismatic leadership and popularity, attention will shift to how Mr Putin will manage an eventual presidential transition.
The weakness of most political and legal institutions-as well as the personalised and opaque governance system around Mr Putin-risks introducing elevated uncertainty into the political arena during the transition period. Most Russians associate Mr Putin's tenure with stability and prosperity, compared with the tumultuous 1990s, and this factors heavily into the popular aversion to political change. Any successor is likely to come from the team around Mr Putin and will not herald a sharp change in the policy agenda. However, it could be difficult for a successor to build legitimacy, given the weak long-term economic outlook and the strength of Mr Putin's legacy. Concern about political stability is likely to deter the government from pursuing radical reforms, especially if these prove unpopular.
Social unrest is a risk, but not our core scenario
Social unrest (which the government portrays as being orchestrated by the West) represents the biggest threat to political stability. As a result, the authorities monitor public opinion closely. Public support for the government and Mr Putin has fallen since June 2018, when the government announced its decision to raise the pension age from 2019. In August 2018 Mr Putin offered concessions softening the pension reform, attempting to present himself as the guardian of the Russian population against government plans that supposedly ran counter to popular interests. However, polling conducted by the Levada Centre, a well-respected Russian pollster, indicate that since mid-2018 into early 2019 approval of both the government and the president have fallen to pre-2014 levels (the illegal annexation of Crimea boosted Mr Putin's approval ratings markedly in February 2014). Aside from the issues of succession and pension reform, the greatest risks to political stability relate to the economy and the financial system.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Russia is formally a "super-presidential" political system, with a high degree of power vested in the executive. The "vertical of power" was a leitmotif of Mr Putin's efforts to reconstitute and recentralise state power during his first two presidencies. In practice, however, the capacity of the president and the government to implement policy is circumscribed by weak institutions and an inefficient and inflexible bureaucracy. Russia has been characterised as a hybrid state, in which the formal institutions of governance co-exist with informal networks that can subvert constitutional order and the rule of law.
Although Mr Putin is more powerful than any other individual in Russia, his capacity to influence the political system as a whole is limited. Limitations on the media, and civil society, also hamper public oversight of policy formation and implementation. As a result, when major policy issues are at stake, there is a tendency towards "manual control", in which leading officials, or Mr Putin himself, take direct responsibility for the implementation of policy, which is then heavily publicised in state media. This personalisation of the policymaking process only reinforces the informal practices that it is intended to resolve. Businesses should not assume that government legislation, or even executive orders from the president, will necessarily change practices on the ground, or that legal judgments will be consistent with new laws.
There is likely to be a partial rebalancing of power away from the centre in favour of the regions in the 2019-23 forecast period. The re-establishment of direct gubernatorial elections in 2012 (albeit with nominations partly controlled by the centre) has prompted regional heads to focus more closely on local issues, and also endow them with greater legitimacy. Lower global oil prices compared with their pre-2014 levels will cut federal financing to the regions and municipalities, possibly fuelling popular discontent in remote regions.
The ineffectiveness of the state and bureaucratic interference in the economy are serious obstacles to doing business. Weak institutional and political accountability makes policymaking vulnerable to lobbying by powerful political-economic groups. Russia will remain a "limited access order" in the forecast period, in which politically connected insiders maintain high barriers of entry to new market participants.
Quality of public administration remains poor
The quality of the public administration is unlikely to improve significantly in 2019-23. Contrary to most impressions, the number of bureaucrats is not particularly large compared with other countries. Civil servants represent less than 3% of the employed labour force, similar to China and Turkey, and far less than the OECD average of about 9%. The problem with the bureaucracy is that it is sometimes corrupt and often inefficient, not that it is too big. In fact, a smaller civil service might even compound the problems of inefficiency.
The court system is slow, underfunded, and open to political influence and capture by private interests. Corporate "raiding", in which companies use law-enforcement services and/or the judiciary to seize the business of a competitor or to silence a businessman deemed that is a danger to the stability of the state, is a significant risk to doing business. The decision in 2013 to merge the Supreme Arbitration Court, which ruled on business disputes, with the Supreme Court, which oversees criminal and other civil disputes, represented a further setback to judicial independence. The arbitration courts had been separated from the general court system in the 1990s and had built up a track record of upholding property rights and supporting corporate governance.
Corruption cases are often used to settle business or political scores
Corruption remains a serious business risk. The largely state-controlled media cannot be relied upon to investigate and publicise corruption. Anti-corruption investigations are often used as a tool in political and business disputes, rather than to enforce the rule of law. Fiscal pressures may push the government to take more concerted steps to try to reduce the scale of high-level corruption in areas such as state procurement. However, tackling the broader problem of corruption would require deep structural and regulatory change, which could prove highly disruptive (provided the government has the willingness to embark on such a path, which, at any rate, remains unlikely). The political environment has grown more authoritarian since Mr Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, and even more so since the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014. The operations of independent media outlets have been further restricted, and controls on the internet have been increased. Curbs on the freedom of the press reduce the likelihood that efforts to counter corruption in the bureaucracy and state enterprises will be successful.
Political outlook: Election watch
In March 2018 Mr Putin was comfortably re-elected for a fourth term as president. With Dmitry Medvedev reappointed as prime minister (signalling policy continuity), it remains to be seen who could succeed the president in 2024; we believe that it is too early to identify a possible successor. Gubernatorial elections took place in 22 regions in September 2018; United Russia, the party closely associated with Mr Putin, performed poorly, hinting at rising popular discontent. This means that the 2021 parliamentary election will be a major test for United Russia.
Political outlook: International relations
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia backs separatist rebels in the eastern Donbas region. The current status quo of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting seems likely to endure for several years-certainly at least until the 2019 Ukrainian presidential and parliamentary elections. A frozen conflict will prevent Ukraine from joining the EU and NATO, which Russia views as a direct threat to its national interests.
Russia-Ukraine relations have deteriorated further in recent months as a result of rising military tensions in the Sea of Azov, Ukraine's decision in September to terminate the 1997 Treaty on Friendship with Russia and a schism in the Orthodox Church in October after the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople supported an appeal to establish an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The Ukraine conflict has led to a deterioration in Russia's relations with the West since 2014. In response, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russian officials, as well as on the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors; firms in these sectors cannot raise capital on US or EU financial markets. Russia has responded with a ban on almost all Western food imports. Additional US sanctions also prohibit global firms from conducting business with Russian companies for the construction, modernisation or repair of energy pipelines (although projects started before August 2017, such as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany, are excluded from the ban).
We expect existing US and EU sanctions to remain in place in the forecast period. US-Russia relations will remain poor, owing to deep-seated differences on Syria (where Russia props up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president), Iran (with which Russia is strengthening trade and political ties), Ukraine (where Russia backs separatist rebels), and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (that the US withdrew from in February, accusing Russia of non-compliance). The US imposed new sanctions on Russia in March, April and August 2018, but their implementation has remained uneven and US statements have been contradictory. Additional US sanctions on Russia in 2019 are likely, but these will not alter Russia's foreign policy; however, we do not believe that the US will impose stringent sanctions, for instance on Russian sovereign debt or state-owned banks, as these could hurt US investors, destabilise international financial markets and possibly lead to a sharp retaliation from Russia (for instance through cyber-attacks).

The business environment score improves slightly, from 5.23 out of 10 in the historical period (2014-18) to 5.51 in the forecast period (2019-23). Owing to more rapid improvements in other countries, Russia falls from 63rd to 67th out of 82 countries in the global ranking. The improvement in Russia's score is primarily driven by gains in the macroeconomic environment and market opportunities categories. Russia's GDP now exceeds the pre-crisis peak recorded in 2014, but real incomes have declined for five successive years. Incomes will recover over the forecast period, leading to a rise in household consumption, although the growth rate will be low. The government will record substantial fiscal surpluses in the forecast period and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) will hold inflation close to the 4% target from 2020. Government spending on infrastructure will increase over the forecasting period, particularly for transportation. The basic tax rates for individuals and business are unlikely to be raised. International sanctions will remain in place, but rising state resources and the gradual diversification of foreign funding will lead to a modest improvement in financing conditions. Russia continues to score well for quality of labour market and technological readiness, thanks to its educated workforce, a legacy of the former Soviet Union.
Russia's business environment remains difficult
Government policy towards private enterprise and competition will remain the worst-scoring category and is expected to deteriorate further. The state's dominant role in the economy will endure and could also threaten more competitive areas of the economy, such as information technology. The overall political environment is unconducive to long-term investment given both geopolitical risks and uncertainty over how and when an eventual political transition could be enacted. Despite international sanctions and protectionists measures, capital controls or limits to currency convertibility are unlikely.

Business environment outlook: Russia's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: No further sales of stakes in state-controlled companies. Sanctions may increase role of state in some sectors.
2021-23: State involvement in economy remains high, deterring and limiting competition in most sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Special investment contract scheme providing tax cuts and regulatory guarantees for foreign investors is launched.
2021-23: Government remains committed to localisation policies and state subsidies that distort operating environment in favour of local firms in some sectors. Outside these sectors, foreign firms face similar operating conditions to local firms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: EU and US sectoral sanctions remain in place; US sanctions expanded but fall short of targeting Russian sovereign debt. The Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union concludes some free-trade agreements.
2021-23: Sectoral sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions remain in place. Further import restrictions to promote localisation of production remain possible. Risk of exchange controls remains low.
Taxes
2019-20: Excise duties on alcohol and tobacco rise. Gradual cut in oil export duties, offset by increase in mineral extraction tax.
2021-23: Some non-tax levies brought into the tax code. Basic tax rates for businesses do not change.
Financing
2019-20: International financial sanctions limit access to external capital markets. Further measures adopted to facilitate non-US dollar-denominated lending and trade, but capital flows and financial links to and from Asia will remain modest.
2021-23: Central Bank of Russia (CBR) reforms improve the stability of the banking system, but the sector remains state-dominated, distorting capital allocation. Companies continue to rely heavily on retained profits to finance investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Education spending rises, albeit from a low base. Migration from Central Asia remains substantial, but low-skilled.
2021-23: The size of the local workforce begins to decline, further constraining productivity growth. The retirement age rises incrementally. Investment in retraining and lifelong learning remains inadequate.
Infrastructure
2019-20: New private public partnership model run by Vneshekonombank is developed, with substantial public funding.
2021-23: Infrastructure spending rises, with a particular focus on the regional road system, supported by the National Welfare Fund (the sovereign wealth fund).
Technological readiness
2019-20: Roll-out of fourth-generation mobile networks continues, but coverage still patchy and unreliable in remote areas.
2021-23: Research and development spending increases, but remains significantly below OECD average.

Russia's leadership regards macroeconomic stability as a prerequisite for state security, and it will remain a high priority throughout the forecast period. The federal budget will remain in surplus through the forecast period, limiting additional borrowing (especially externally). The fiscal rule aims to balance the budget based on a conservative oil price of US$40/barrel (in 2017 prices), well below The Economist Intelligence Unit's oil price forecast throughout 2019-23 (as at April 2019). Excess revenue from the oil sector will be accumulated as foreign-currency reserves, providing a buffer in the case of financial or geopolitical shocks.
Despite rising reserves, we expect the Ministry of Finance to successfully resist political pressure to significantly loosen fiscal policy so as to contain popular discontent with low living standards. The fiscal rule will also prevent the appreciation of the rouble (against the US dollar), as a result of which Russia is expected to run a current-account surplus throughout the forecast period. Public debt is low; the external debt of state-companies is significantly higher but will remain stable over the forecast period as international financial sanctions constrain access to Western capital markets.
The main risk to macroeconomic stability will continue to be the heavy reliance on revenue from the oil and gas sector. However, Russia's oil sector is at the low end of the global cost curve, and would probably maintain production and investment at a price as low as US$25/b.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition has always been one of Russia's worst-scoring indicators, and the country slips further in the global ranking in 2019-23 (ranking 78th out of 82 countries). The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service estimates that the state controls up to 70% of the economy. Competition is distorted in many sectors by state subsidies and soft budget constraints. Politics and business are closely entwined, and the justice system compromised. Sanctions have deepened the dependence of firms on state banks and government subsidies, especially in the defence sector; state-directed lending is widespread. Russia is one of just 12 countries on the "Priority Watch List" for intellectual property rights protection and enforcement of the Office of the US Trade Representative.
There will be little privatisation over the forecast period
Some officials continue to stress the need to reduce the state's role in the economy, but a major privatisation programme is unlikely; if such a programme was launched, foreign investors' appetite would be constrained by sanctions. The government has budgeted for almost no privatisation receipts in 2019-21. Major state companies may use their privileged position to acquire control of foreign competitors, as with state-owned oil transportation firm Transneft's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Novorossiysk Port in October 2018.
The court system is often compromised, but less subordinate to political interests than is widely assumed. In a number of high-profile cases the state or powerful insiders have used the judiciary to expropriate businesses. This will remain a significant risk for leading entrepreneurs, but such cases remain rare. Contrary to widespread opinion, businesses continue to win court cases against the state frequently. The merging of regular and arbitrazh courts in 2014 appears to have reversed some of the improvements in the quality of jurisprudence in commercial cases. An improvement in the protection of commercial and property rights over the forecast period is unlikely.
The government will continue to make some progress in removing the technical and administrative barriers to conducting business, including by expanding e-government services and reducing the frequency of cumbersome and time-consuming regulatory checks. However, protection of intellectual property is likely to remain weak. Given the confrontation with the West, the Russian government has little incentive to strengthen oversight, and the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) has considered waiving patent protections for companies based in countries that impose sanctions on Russia.

There are significant regional variations in the business environment
Policy towards foreign investment is Russia's second worst-scoring category in the forecast period, and no improvement in the score is anticipated. The government will continue to promote measures to encourage import substitution, including through an extensive subsidy programme for manufacturers and the agricultural sector. International sanctions and Russian counter-measures are expected to remain in place, and US sanctions are likely to be further extended. The cost of compliance for foreign companies will be significant, whereas Russian companies will face difficulties in navigating a highly uncertain and changing environment. There will continue to be significant regional variations in the operating environment for businesses. However, the government and regional authorities remain keen to attract foreign investment, particularly when this leads to the localisation of production of previously imported goods. Special Investment Contract schemes will gradually become available for foreign companies to negotiate preferential regulatory and tax regimes for greenfield investments.
Foreign investment in "strategic" sectors, which includes most investments in hydrocarbons, metals, defence and communications, will continue to be closely controlled by the government. Permission from a government commission is required to acquire a stake of more than 25% in so-called strategic industries. In practice, the law on strategic sectors is not expected to be a significant impediment to foreign investment, although obtaining approval is time consuming. The significance of formal rules on foreign direct investment, as on other matters, has waned. Obtaining the personal endorsement of local or sectoral actors and that of the president is of greater relevance.
Geopolitical tensions with the West have raised the risk that rulings of international investment arbitration bodies may be disregarded by Russian courts. However, Russia has continued to formally abide by WTO rulings on state subsidies, while in practice retaining high-and increasing-levels of protectionism. The increasing role of the Russian security services in economic policymaking may result in additional restrictions being placed on foreign investment in certain sectors. The "securitisation" of economic policy-making has also had a negative effect on the quality of legislation, which is often adopted quickly, with little stakeholder consultation or consideration of the impact on business. This particularly concerns the information technology sector.
Despite the "securitisation" of economic policy, the government, and particularly regional authorities, will remain eager to attract foreign investment. In 2019 the government will establish a new framework for Special Investment Contracts, providing protection against regulatory or tax changes and giving foreign companies access to state support for the localisation of manufacturing production and state procurement tenders. Foreign car companies will also be eligible for compensation of scrappage fees, one of the main protectionist measures to support the automotive industry.
Russia will conduct only a limited "pivot to the east" over the forecast period. The restricted pool of potential investors and Western sanctions will enable non-Western companies to demand favourable terms, particularly in the resource sector and high-tech sectors. High-level investment by Chinese firms is likely to receive official backing (albeit under important scrutiny on so-called security grounds), allowing such companies to often overcome the administrative and regulatory barriers encountered by foreign firms.

We do not expect formal capital controls to be imposed
Russia is a member of the WTO, having made considerable progress over the pre-crisis period in liberalising its foreign trade and exchange regime. However, the stand-off with the West over Ukraine since 2014 has led to tit-for-tat sanctions, with a significant risk that further trade restrictions will be imposed. Ensuring sanctions compliance increases the cost and duration of a wide range of international transactions, and could delay payments (especially in US dollar). Russian economic policy has grown increasingly protectionist, and the EU has made a number of complaints to the WTO in relation to increased non-tariff barriers. The capital account was liberalised in 2006, although Russian tax residents are still required to repatriate earnings from foreign trade deals. The government plans to remove requirements for the repatriation of funds from contracts denominated in roubles by 2024 and to relax requirements for foreign-currency contracts. The authorities stopped short of reintroducing formal exchange controls when the rouble came under strong pressure in 2008-09 and 2014-15. Formal capital or exchange controls are unlikely, except in the case of severe oil price (and thus exchange-rate) volatility, and are not part of our core forecast.
Tensions between Russia and the West are systemic in nature, and there is little likelihood of a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine in 2019-23. We expect US and EU sectoral and Crimea-related sanctions to remain in place throughout the forecast period. The US is likely to impose further sanctions on Russia in 2019. These could include restrictions on the purchase and trade in new sovereign debt, but this is not our core scenario, as the US will remain wary of Russia's potential retaliation (for instance through cyber-attacks). Companies based in third countries that trade with sanctioned Russian entities could also face increased pressure from the US Treasury, particularly banks and defence contractors.
The use of economic sanctions is now well established as a policy tool
The use of economic sanctions is now well established in Russia as a policy tool, and a diplomatic conflict with any foreign country (in particular in the post-Soviet area) could result in some kind of restrictions being imposed on that country's imports. Russia's ban on Western food imports is now seen as a central element of government economic policy to develop the local industry, and is likely to remain in place throughout the forecast period. The government adopted only symbolic counter-measures in response to the April and August 2018 US sanctions, but there remains a risk that the leadership will place restrictions on the operations of individual Western companies.
Beyond formal sanctions, informal and non-tariff barriers to trade will remain substantial. Even before the latest trade conflict with the West, Russia had introduced a whole range of restrictions on food and agricultural products using phytosanitary justifications. It will continue to provide extensive state support to important sectors such as automotive, agriculture and medical goods. A number of disputes have been formally raised at WTO level between the EU and Russia. Russia's focus on economic sovereignty increases the risk that it will not implement rulings against it reached by the WTO or other multilateral bodies, although in June 2018 it removed anti-dumping tariffs against Italian and German automobiles following a WTO ruling.
Russia will continue to promote regional trade integration within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). It will actively seek new free-trade agreements (FTAs) between the bloc and third countries. Free-trade deals with Iran and Israel are likely in the forecast period. Negotiations over an FTA between China and the EEU are unlikely to be concluded by 2023. The effective operation of the EEU as a single market has always been in doubt and has been undermined by Russia's sanctions and counter-sanctions with the West, but work to harmonise regulations across the bloc will continue.

Following a rise in value-added tax (VAT) at the start of 2019, the government is committed to keeping the corporate and income tax rates stable for the remainder of Mr Putin's term, to 2024. However the underlying tax code is subject to regular changes; the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry estimates an average of 30 changes to the tax code are made each year. The time it takes to pay taxes is now comparable with that in the advanced OECD countries. Enforcement of tax regulation remains uneven, and the tax authorities are often implicated in cases of corporate raiding. Russia's income tax rate is low, at a flat rate of 13%. The standard VAT rate, at 20%, is slightly higher than the unweighted OECD average of 19.3%. As of the start of 2019, VAT is now also charged on electronic goods and services provided by foreign companies Employers also pay a 30% social insurance premium into a non-budgetary fund that significantly raises the effective rate of personal tax. The standard rate of corporation tax is 20%, which is low by international standards. The tax system for mineral resources is responsive to price movements and is not generally seen as an impediment to investment. The production-sharing agreements signed in the 1990s are unlikely to be revised further; however, the government is highly unlikely to conclude further deals of this kind.
Main tax rates will not fluctuate substantially
We expect the government to keep the main tax rates stable over the rest of the forecast period, in line with recent pledges. The budget is forecast to be in surplus throughout the forecast period and tax-collection rates will continue to rise, mitigating the need for further increases in the tax burden.
Land and property taxes for families with children will be cut throughout 2019. Following a pilot project, the government is likely to roll out a scheme to bring self-employed into the formal economy with a low tax rate of 4%. Take-up is likely to be limited and the grey economy will remain large.
As part of a systemisation of the tax system, several non-tax levies, in particular charges for emissions and environmental damage, will be brought into the tax code. Although this will not formally increase the financial burden on business, transferring these charges to the oversight of the tax authorities is likely to result in stricter enforcement.
The government is overhauling the tax system in the energy sector
The government plans to complete a "tax manoeuvre" in the oil sector by 2024 that will reduce export taxes on oil and oil products to zero over the next six years, while increasing the mineral extraction tax (MET). The government estimates that this will increase the tax burden on the oil sector by Rb220-270bn (US$3.4bn-4.2bn) a year-a modest sum. Some oil refiners will receive subsidies to hold down gasoline prices. The government is likely to make further changes to the tax regime in response to movements in the oil price and industry lobbying, including conceding preferential agreements for mature fields.
In mid-2018 Andrei Belousov, a presidential advisor, called for a windfall tax on major resource companies that had benefited from high commodity prices and the low rouble (against the US dollar). We do not expect a windfall tax to be formally adopted, however the authorities will put heavy pressure on resource companies to maintain high levels of investment, particularly in infrastructure and initiatives that support the goals of the 12 "National Projects" developed by the government in 2018.

Access to finance is a constraint for Russian business, and corporate investment is driven by retained earnings. International sanctions on several major state-owned banks will keep the cost of financing high. However, reduced reliance on external funding has increased the resilience of the banking sector and focused government effort on developing local sources of capital. The CBR has made progress in cleaning up the banking sector, but the political influence of the largest banks constrains effective regulation. State banks dominate the financial sector and directed lending is widespread, allowing many non-competitive enterprises to continue to operate.
International sanctions constrain external borrowing
Owing to sanctions, all borrowers, whether subject to Western sanctions or not, will continue to encounter restricted access to external financing, and borrowing costs will remain elevated for the foreseeable future. Even before the sanctions were first imposed in 2014, the cost of financing for business was significantly higher in Russia than in other emerging markets. If sanctions are eased or lifted (not our core scenario), risk premiums on loans to Russian banks will come down only slowly, and it is unlikely that international banks will return to the Russian market quickly.
The finance ministry and the CBR will maintain substantial foreign-exchange reserves to support sanctioned banks and major enterprises, and provide foreign-currency liquidity as required through special-purpose vehicles. These will also provide the resources to bail out systemically important institutions in the event of another financial crisis (not our core scenario).
Vnesheconombank (VEB, a state-owned investment bank) will be an important part of the government's investment programme in 2019-24, providing state guarantees and financing for major public-private partnerships. The conservative budget rule and tight fiscal policy will lead to the steady accumulation of public savings. The value of the National Welfare Fund (NWF, the sovereign welfare fund) will exceed 7% of GDP in 2019, the threshold the government believes is sufficient for fiscal stability.
Efforts to "de-dollarise" foreign trade relationships will continue to remain small in scale over the forecast period. Non-Western countries will account for a greater share of external financing, but banks in third countries will remain wary of dealing with sanctioned entities.
Banking sector fragmentation has decreased in recent years
Financial regulation has improved from a low base, with the CBR using the crisis following the rouble devaluation to force the closure of a significant number of small, poorly managed and under-capitalised banks. Nevertheless, corruption and related-party lending remain widespread. These led to the collapse of three major banks in 2017, indicating that deficiencies in financial oversight remain. The banking sector was more stable in 2018, but fragilities will remain throughout 2019-23.
The financial sector will remain dominated by state-owned banks, which will inhibit the efficient allocation of capital. The banking sector will continue to provide insufficient intermediation. Businesses will continue to rely on retained profits to finance a large share of their investment programmes.

Business environment outlook: The labour market
               
Value of index a   Global rank b   Regional rank c

The labour market will remain an attraction for investors. Advantages include the low cost of labour (although senior-level Russian talent is expensive) and a well-educated workforce (a legacy of the Soviet education system). Education levels are high relative to per-head income, and university enrolment is comparable with OECD levels. Despite the muted demand outlook, labour shortages are likely to be a constraint in some sectors, particularly high-skilled areas. Employment protection for permanent employees in Russia is above the OECD average, and official statistics suggest that the use of temporary contracts is low in international comparison. As a result, the labour market tends to adjust to demand shocks through reducing wage levels and hours worked, rather than the overall employment level. Bonuses often make up a significant share of earnings, increasing payroll flexibility for employers. A long-delayed rise in the pension age is now being implemented, but resources to enable older workers to retrain and continue employment are inadequate.
In the coming years the retirement age will rise incrementally, to 65 for men and to 60 for women, providing a boost to the working-age population. Nevertheless the labour force (defined as 15-64) will fall by 0.5-1% a year in 2019-23 and this decline will continue in the medium- to long-term. Net positive migration from Central Asia will remain high, but this will principally fill gaps in low and medium-skilled positions.
Labour costs are low relative to high education levels
The labour market is likely to remain inflexible, although this will be mitigated by a substantial informal sector. The government is unlikely to enact major liberalisation of employment legislation. The large state role in the economy and government subsidies to main industries will continue to create incentives to hoard workers and hinder the efficient allocation of labour to faster-growing sectors. Labour mobility will also remain low. Increased investment in regional roads and transport from smaller towns to major agglomerations will provide a modest boost to labour availability and flexibility where growth and demand are strongest.
Despite demographic pressures, labour costs will remain low relative to the education level of the workforce. The budget rule will keep the rouble weak against the dollar and inflation is likely to remain close to target.
Unions will remain subordinate to regional and national officials. The incidence of strikes and labour-related unrest should continue to be comparatively low, and the authorities will typically intervene quickly to resolve disputes.

A modest improvement in the score and ranking for this category is expected over the forecast period, as the government has made investment in roads (an area of persistent weakness, partly owing to extreme weather conditions) a priority over the next six years. Air-transport capacity is extensive, but connections between regional centres (rather than via Moscow, the capital) are thinner. Mobile-phone penetration exceeds that of the other BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, South Africa). The quality of federal (arterial) roads has improved in recent years, but there is strong regional variation in the quality of infrastructure, and more than half of the regional road system is unpaved. A large share of goods is transported by railway. A focus on major, politically important construction projects has diverted funds from small, but more effective, projects. It is estimated that the development of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, has absorbed up to a quarter of infrastructure spending since 2014.
Infrastructure links with China will grow
Infrastructure spending has been low and flat as a share of GDP since 2012, but is expected to rise over the forecast period. In 2018 the president pledged Rb11trn (US$170bn) over 2018-24 to improve the road network, with a particular focus on improving the quality of the regional road system. About 25% of these funds are supposedly due to be raised from the private sector.
The quality of electricity supply will remain good, apart from in Crimea, which has suffered major blackouts. There is currently a surplus of energy supply, but much of the generating capacity is old and in need of replacement. Price liberalisation will push up business costs, but should reverse the recent fall in investment in 2019-23.
The government will seek to boost public-private partnerships led by VEB and underpinned by sovereign guarantees. VEB is aiming to fund projects valued at Rb3trn, but according to the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, partnership with private banks could increase this portfolio by four times. Major domestic businesses will come under heavy pressure to participate in these initiatives.
Rail infrastructure will remain good, but a reluctance to raise tariffs will hold back investment. Cargo transport speeds will remain low, and commercial users, in particular in the agricultural sector, will encounter bottlenecks.
Transportation infrastructure for the Northern Sea Route through the Arctic Ocean will be a major focus of investment in the forecast period. A private energy company, Novatek, will develop the second phase of the Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) field. The Power of Siberia gas pipeline, linking gasfields in eastern Siberia to China, is will begin operations before mid-2019. A second gas pipeline to China from western Siberia (the Altai pipeline), which would in principle give Gazprom, the state-owned gas monopoly, the power to switch supplies between Europe and Asia, remains under discussion. Russia will be a participant in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), but the number of projects initiated under its aegis will be limited. There has been no progress on a high-speed rail line from Moscow to Beijing, China's capital.

Technological readiness is one of Russia's best-scoring categories. Internet usage and mobile-phone penetration are high, and e-commerce has grown rapidly in recent years, despite declining real incomes. The government will invest heavily in digitising its services online over the forecast period, but Internet regulation will also become more stringent. Spending on research and development (R&D) is low as a share of GDP, and Russia accounts for just 0.23% of international patents. The government is officially eager to harness new technology to raise productivity and trend growth, but previous efforts to foster the development of high-technology sectors have had limited success. Robotisation is one-tenth of the OECD average and the lowest among the BRICS, despite Russia's large manufacturing sector.
Investment levels are low
Spending on R&D is just 1.1% of GDP, and investment levels remain low, at about 20% of GDP (compared with about 45% of GDP in China). Government spending on education will rise modestly as a share of GDP over the forecast period, which will boost public funds for research. Commercial R&D investment is pro-cyclical and is also likely to pick up in the first half of the forecast period as the economy continues to recover from the 2014-15 recession. Overall levels of R&D spending will nevertheless remain below the OECD average (2.3% of GDP).
The rapid growth in e-commerce (expanding on average by almost 20% a year over the past four years) is expected to continue. E-commerce accounts for 6-7% of total retail, compared with 10-15% in OECD countries.
Development of Russia's information technology (IT) and software industries may be inhibited by growing regulation, as well as censorship. The government is concerned about "information security" and is likely to adopt a "sovereign Internet" bill to enable to Russian section of the Internet to continue to function if cut off from external servers. This will also increase the authorities' ability to block content. This bill and localisation and storage requirements will impose costs on communication and IT companies, reducing funds available for research and investment and delaying the roll-out of fifth-generation mobile coverage. Major foreign IT companies will be exposed to high levels of scrutiny by the authorities. The government is eager to replace foreign software with domestic alternatives, reducing opportunities for international IT companies.
Low levels of competition, high barriers to entry and a focus on the development market will continue to deter corporate investment in innovative technologies. The state will seek to incentivise innovation through procurement policy, and to coerce large state-owned companies to increase R&D spending, with limited success.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Russia's stand-off with the West has strengthened statist, nationalist and protectionist trends within the government. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a priority. This includes a large and positive sovereign external asset position, protectionist measures to support domestic manufacturing through import substitution and a cautious approach to foreign investment. The authorities are also reducing the use of the US dollar in an effort to insulate the country from potential US sanctions, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects these efforts to remain relatively limited in scope as the majority of Russia's trade continues to be conducted in US dollars.
During Mr Putin's fourth presidential term we expect economic reform to continue to be subordinated to the imperatives of political stability. The policy agenda will focus on ambitious national development targets, which include boosting investment, improving education and healthcare, and reducing poverty. Despite global oil prices forecast at US$61-76/barrel (significantly higher than 2015-17 levels), achieving these goals will be challenging. The government aims to boost revenue through tax and pension reforms passed in mid-2018.
The banking sector represents one of the main downside risks to the economy. The sector is struggling with the legacy of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. The imposition of sanctions on Russia from 2014 that prohibit state banks from raising capital in the US and the EU, followed by the collapse of the rouble against the US dollar in 2015, led to a surge in non-performing loans (NPLs). In 2017 the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) took a majority equity stake in B&N Bank, a major private lender, and bought more than 99% of Otkritie, formerly Russia's largest private bank, as part of a bail-out process. The situation improved last year, with the NPL/total loan ratio peaking at about 11% in mid-2018, but the CBR continues to provide funding to support the banks that it has taken over. The situation could deteriorate if a sharp depreciation of the rouble (not our core forecast) leads to corporate defaults on external debt.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government revenue 18.8 18.4 17.9 17.5 16.6 16.4
Budget balance 2.7 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.0 1.9
Government debt 10.3 9.3 8.8 8.1 7.3 6.6
In response to the collapse in oil prices in 2014-16, which significantly reduced fiscal revenue, the government sharply cut spending in real terms. In 2018 oil prices recovered to an average of US$71.1/b (up by 30.7% year on year), and the economic recovery boosted tax revenue from non-hydrocarbons. As a result, the budget posted a surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2018.
Under the Ministry of Finance's fiscal rule, if oil prices exceed US$40/b, the additional revenue is converted into foreign currency to boost the National Wealth Fund (NWF). The CBR (which implements the fiscal rule) suspended foreign-currency purchases until mid-January 2019 to support the national currency, but has since resumed the purchases.
The government's 2019-21 budget plan will maintain a fiscal surplus. Expenditure will grow modestly in real terms, but will continue to contract as a share of GDP. Military spending will remain high, but spending will be redirected towards health and education. Revenue assumptions will remain conservative, retaining the US$40/b oil price assumption-we expect oil prices to average about US$70/b in the 2019-23 forecast period. Budget revenue growth is therefore likely to remain strong, and we forecast an average budget surplus of about 2% of GDP in 2019-23.
Public debt is low (10.3% of GDP in 2018) and will decline in the forecast period as a result of budget surpluses and the willingness to limit reliance on debt (so as to make the economy resilient to potential external shocks such as sanctions or a drop in oil prices). At end-February 2019 the NWF had total assets of US$59.1bn (or about 3.6% of GDP). Given that we expect the oil price to exceed US$40/b in 2019-23, the NWF will grow steadily. This will provide the government with a fiscal cushion to mitigate the impact of further potential Western sanctions.

Deposit rate (av; %) 5.4 5.6 5.8 5.7 5.6 5.6
The central bank will remain cautious
In December 2018 the CBR increased its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 7.75%, in anticipation of the inflationary pressures expected in 2019, driven by the increase of the value-added tax (VAT) rate and the resumption of foreign-currency purchases from January 2019. This followed a 25-point increase in September, in response to the imposition of additional US sanctions in April and August 2018, which led to a depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar.
The CBR held its policy rate steady in March 2019. It noted that inflation in February (5.2% year on year) remained within its forecast band and that the inflationary effect of the value-added tax (VAT) rate increase has materialised, but remains moderate (the impact to annual inflation stands at about 0.6-0.7 percentage points). The central bank expects above-target inflation of about 5-5.5% in 2019, before a return to the targeted 4% in 2020, in line with our forecast.
Given the CBR's pre-emptive tightening in December 2018 and the modest impact of the VAT increase, we expect it to hold the policy rate steady in 2019. However, any downward shock on global oil prices or new sanctions on Russia would prompt the CBR to tighten policy quickly to soften the resulting depreciation of the Russian currency against the US dollar.

In 2018 growth was driven by private consumption and exports. A pick-up in household borrowing and sharp consumer price disinflation drove private consumption. Rising oil prices and post-Soviet record-high oil output boosted exports. Large government infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the bridge over the Kerch Strait, supported investment growth.
According to a first estimate from the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), real GDP grew by 2.3% in 2018-the fastest growth rate since 2012. The 2.3% figure exceeded our previous 1.7% estimate and the projections of the Ministry of Economy, which tend to be overoptimistic. Rosstat had previously estimated average growth of 1.5% year on year in the first three quarters. The jump in the full-year figure was attributed to the inclusion of construction work at the third phase of the Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) field in the Far East, which was launched last year. As the 2.3% full-year growth rate implies an implausible 4.5% year-on-year growth rate in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant revision to the official data on quarterly growth breakdown.
In 2019 we forecast a slowdown to 1.5% real GDP growth. Private consumption will continue to drive growth, albeit more weakly. Higher domestic interest rates will dampen consumer credit growth, and rising inflation-driven by the VAT increase-will reduce purchasing power. International sanctions-as well as broader political and business uncertainty-will remain significant constraints on investment, as will the lack of a "culture of failure" (the absence of entrepreneurial spirit weighs on innovation and investment). Export growth will also moderate as risks to the Chinese economy increase, the tariff war weighs on global trade, and as oil prices fall by a forecast 7.1% on average from 2018 levels. Oil production is likely to decline slightly following a new deal between Russia and OPEC to reduce global output in 2019.
In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low productivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that growth will average 1.7% per year in 2019-23.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Growth in agriculture has fluctuated considerably in recent years, as harvest depends on weather conditions, averaging about 3% annually over 2007-17 (with fluctuations ranging from a 12% contraction in 2010 to a 14.8% expansion the following year, from a low base). Basic restructuring, debt workouts and the onset of agricultural land reform have gradually started to turn around a sector that was traditionally regarded as Russia's most inefficient. It is only since 2002 that farmers have been legally entitled to buy and sell land, and to use it as collateral. However, local authorities remain reluctant to initiate land privatisation.
Agriculture will be one of the strongest growth sectors in 2019-23
The imposition of an import ban on a wide range of Western food products from August 2014 has increased profits for domestic producers and their incentives for expansion. We expect the government to maintain the food-import ban throughout the forecast period, but uncertainty over how long the embargo will last constrains long-term investment. In principle, large productivity gains are possible-output of wheat per hectare, for example, is 35% less than the OECD average.
Although state aid to the sector has risen, lower competition could constrain efficiency gains, particularly as foreign investment falls. Moreover, import substitution has no clear record of success historically, often because of local production inefficiencies. To date, the sums earmarked by the government for support to agriculture have been too small to have much of an impact on a sector that still employs about 10% of the labour force.
Manufacturing output plunged by almost 15% during the recession of 2009. It rebounded strongly in 2010-13, but has grown much more slowly-and dipped in 2015 as a result of the devaluation of the rouble-in subsequent years. Contrary to a widespread misconception, Russia has one of the world's largest manufacturing sectors. However, much of this is not internationally competitive and relies on state orders or state support in the form of soft budget constraints.
Heightened tensions with the West have led to renewed emphasis on import substitution, especially in the military sector, which has been particularly targeted by international financial sanctions. Domestic producers are likely to lobby hard for further state support in the forecast period, with some success. The rouble's low exchange rate (against the US dollar and the euro) will support the limited expansion of domestic manufacturing production, although this process will be constrained by the tight labour market and limited availability of financing. If global oil prices rebound, the CBR may intervene to hold down the rouble against the US dollar to support domestic producers (this would have the welcome side-effect of building up sovereign reserves and increasing fiscal revenue). However, the undervalued rouble (against major currencies) also increases the cost of imported manufacturing inputs. Defence spending will remain high as the government seeks to develop its domestic military industrial complex (in part to fill gaps in supplies opened up by the conflict with Ukraine, with which Russia used to have strong industrial ties in the defence sector as a legacy of the former Soviet Union), as well as to keep the military on side politically.
Services will recover only slowly, as household spending will remain weak
The structure of GDP growth shifted towards services strongly in the 2000s, and the sector now accounts for more than half of the economy. Average sectoral growth in 2007-17 was slightly above 2% annually, with a contraction in 2015-16 during the recession. The services sector benefited both from high productivity gains as market transition led to the rapid emergence of entirely new subsectors, and strong growth in household incomes. In 2003-08 the strengthening of the rouble (against the US dollar) and improvement in Russia's terms of trade as a result of high commodity prices also pushed up household purchasing power. These factors will not be replicated over the forecast period, and growth in much of the services sector will be low. International sanctions will limit the expansion of financial services, which cannot raise debt on US and EU capital markets, and reduce funding for investment in other areas. Proposals to involve the private sector more actively in the provision of social services are at an early stage but are potentially a significant growth area. The ageing of the population opens up the potential for greater demand for health, insurance and related services, but lower than previously expected incomes may not provide sufficient incentive for prospective suppliers.
Economic forecast: Oil and gas
  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019
Crude oil production ('000 b/d) 10,545 10,651 10,544 10,439 10,334 10,231

 % change -3.1 -6 -3.0 1.0 1.2 0.5
The extractive sector represents about 10% of gross value added and almost 60% of exports. Growth is likely to be slow in the oil sector over the forecast period, as a result of the gradual depletion of mature fields, as well as international sanctions that restrict investment and the export of some technological equipment to Russia. Although Russia possesses enormous onshore fields, many of these are in the closing years of productive life. New reserves in the Arctic and offshore are more difficult and costly to extract, and this will be accentuated by a ban on the sale of Western high-technology equipment.
The government has allowed limited competition into the gas sector, as privately owned Novatek and state-owned Rosneft, which is primarily an oil producer, have entered the market. State-owned Gazprom will retain its dominant position, bolstered by its ownership of the gas pipeline network.
Western financial sanctions constrain investment in the energy sector
The US has applied sanctions on Gazprom, restricting its access to financing and the transfer of technology for deep-water, offshore and shale exploration. It also applied sanctions that constrain the ability of Western companies to work with Russian energy companies; however, these do not apply to projects-such as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline-that started before mid-2017. We expect these to remain in place throughout the forecast period, constraining the ability of the company to develop its operations further. The EU is highly unlikely to apply sanctions on Gazprom, given the bloc's high dependence on Russian gas imports; in addition, the bloc will continue to block American attempts to derail the Nord Stream 2 project.
Gas output had been stagnating for years until 2017, as Gazprom devoted greater attention to acquiring downstream assets abroad than the development of new gasfields. The company's main west Siberian fields are maturing, but there has been little progress with developing new fields, such as Yamal and Shtokman (estimated to be among the largest gasfields in the world). US sanctions and lower gas prices mean that the company does not have sufficient financing to realise all the infrastructure projects that it has put forward, with the pipeline to Turkey (currently known as Turkish Stream) the most likely casualty of the company's straitened circumstances.
Despite tough negotiations over pricing with China, we expect the Power of Siberia pipeline project, which will deliver 38bn cu metres of gas a year to eastern China, to go ahead (albeit with some delays), which will involve the development of new fields in eastern Siberia. A second western pipeline (Altai) to China is unlikely to be realised in the forecast period. As a result, despite the rhetoric of a "pivot to the east", Europe will remain the principal external customer for Gazprom in the short to medium term at least.
Crude oil represents a major commodity export
Following the financial collapse in the late 1990s, crude oil production rebounded strongly in the early 2000s, reflecting efforts by Russian oil majors to consolidate assets, streamline operations, cut costs, and introduce Western management and technology. It also reflected spare capacity at the west Siberian oilfields, where output slumped steeply in the 1990s. However, oil-production growth has slowed sharply in recent years, as easy gains have been achieved and high marginal taxes weigh on investment. The government and oil industry are currently negotiating revisions to the tax regime in an effort to maintain public revenue from the sector and continue to incentivise investment. Owing to the recent "oil-tax manoeuvre", the export duty rate on oil and oil products will be gradually lowered to zero by 2024, whereas the mineral extraction tax (MET) will correspondingly rise. In theory, the tax amendments should incentivise exports and could lead to a rise in the domestic price of oil and petroleum products. However, the government is wary of a popular backlash, and is proposing to introduce subsidies for some oil refiners and a floating excise rate on petroleum products intended to hold down the price of gasoline when crude oil prices rise.
EU and US energy sanctions are likely to remain in place in 2019-23
The US and the EU have placed sanctions on Rosneft, Russia's leading oil company, and Gazprom Neft, an oil-producing subsidiary of Gazprom. The US has additionally sanctioned Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz (both energy companies), despite the fact they are nominally privately controlled. EU and US sanctions are likely to remain in place throughout our five-year forecast period. The short-term impact on production will probably be limited; however, in the long term the restrictions are likely to impair the country's oil production potential. Lower oil prices will also curtail investment and output growth. Maintaining and expanding production requires foreign expertise and financing to maximise output from mature wells and develop new fields, most of which are technically challenging. However, Western oil majors (such as Exxon in February 2018) have been forced to cancel or suspend a number of joint ventures in Russia. Rosneft may further expand ties with Chinese oil companies, including via long-term supply contracts. At present Chinese companies are unable to substitute for Western technology, but this could change over the medium term.

Russia experienced consumer price disinflation from late 2015 until mid-2018, with inflation at a record low of 2.2% year on year in January-February 2018-far below the CBR's 4% target. Disinflation was assisted by record harvests in 2016-17 and, until April 2018, the strength of the rouble against the US dollar and the euro. Inflation picked up from June, ending 2018 at 4.3% year on year. A weaker harvest pushed up food prices, and the depreciation of the rouble against the dollar boosted imported inflationary pressures.
In 2019-23 we expect average inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-the 4% target. External inflationary pressures are likely to be low. The rise of the VAT rate will boost inflation to an average of 4.9% in 2019. Our forecast of a modest slowdown in the US in 2020 will lead to a depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar; this will continue to fuel inflation, albeit at a lower level than in 2019.

In 2018 the rouble depreciated to an average of Rb62.7:US$1, from Rb58.3:US$1 in 2017, owing to the imposition of new US sanctions and the government's fiscal rule, which prevented the strengthening of the rouble alongside rising oil prices. When the US imposed new sanctions on Russia in April and August, the rouble depreciated against the US dollar, to Rb70.6:US$1 in mid-September, before recovering to an average of Rb69.5:US$1 in October-December.
The outlook for the rouble in 2019 is similar. Oil prices are forecast to average US$66/b and we expect the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) to keep its policy rate on hold, which will support the rouble. This will be offset by Russia's fiscal rule and by the likely imposition of additional US sanctions on Russia. This will drive a further average depreciation of the rouble, to about Rb67.5:US$1 in full-year 2019.
In 2020 a downturn in the US business cycle will drive a decline in global oil prices (from 2019) and weigh further on the rouble. In 2021-23 we forecast a slight overall nominal appreciation as oil prices increase to US$70-76/b. Risks are to the downside-any rapid reduction in global oil prices or imposition of new sanctions could lead to renewed volatility.

The current account will remain in surplus
The current-account surplus rose to the equivalent of 6.6% of GDP in 2018, from 2.1% in 2017, as higher global oil prices boosted the value of exports and a weaker rouble constricted import growth. Non-oil commodity exports performed strongly, with the value of ferrous metal exports rising by 24.3%. A strong harvest in the past two years has also resulted in remarkable growth in agricultural exports. These factors boosted Russia's trade surplus sharply, to US$195bn in 2018, from US$115.4bn in 2017.
We expect the current account to remain comfortably in surplus in 2019-23, owing to large trade surpluses. International sanctions will depress foreign direct investment inflows throughout 2019-23. Although we expect these inflows to recover as the forecast period progresses, they will remain well below their pre-2014 levels.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Russia
Stocks and flows
According to balance-of-payments data from the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows averaged just US$2.8bn per year in 1994-2002, before increasing steadily to reach a record total of US$75bn in 2008 (equal to 4.2% of GDP), the second-largest total among emerging markets after China. As a result of the global financial crisis, FDI inflows plummeted in 2009, to US$36.6bn. In the following three years FDI inflows recovered, to an annual average of just below US$50bn, but shot up to US$69.2bn in 2013. However, a large proportion of inflows in 2013 was accounted for by the return of Russian capital linked both to the Cypriot banking crisis and the Russian government's "de-offshoreisation" agenda. In 2014 inflows fell substantially, by 67% year on year to US$22bn, the lowest level since 2005, following a sharp rise in political risk linked to the Ukraine conflict and the gradual imposition of international financial sanctions. The decline continued in 2015-the first full year of international sanctions, when FDI totalled just US$6.9bn, or 0.5% of GDP. In 2016 FDI inflows recovered to US$32.5bn, or 2.5% of GDP, but almost half of the increase can be attributed to the sale in December 2016 of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft. They dipped slightly in 2017 as a result of this high base, to US$28.6bn, or 1.8% of GDP. In proportional terms, Russia has attracted much less FDI than most transition economies in eastern Europe. Before 2014 Russia's stock of inward FDI was comparable with the other BRIC economies (Brazil, India and China). In 2015 the stock of FDI declined to US$348bn, but picked up to US$478bn in 2016 and US$530bn in 2017, although this is still below the high of US$566bn in 2013.
Origin and distribution
According to the CBR, almost one-third of the total stock of inward FDI is accounted for by Cyprus-based investors (largely from Russian-owned companies registered offshore). Although EU countries dominate Russian foreign trade, EU investors (other than from Cyprus) account for only about 15% of inward FDI stock-and some of that total, as for the Netherlands, is probably also dominated by returning Russian capital flight. In 2013 the UK's share of FDI inflows into Russia was greatly boosted by BP's purchase of close to one-fifth of shares in Rosneft, Russia's largest oil firm. At the end of 2016 Singapore's share was greatly increased when a Singapore-registered investment vehicle served as the conduit for the sale of another 19.5% of shares in Rosneft. According to official figures, China accounts for only a small share of the FDI stock, at US$3bn as at end-September 2018 (from a high of US$4.2bn at end-2017).
Inward FDI is highly concentrated, both sectorally and geographically. Slightly less than one-quarter of the inward FDI stock is in mining, with perhaps one-fifth each in the retail sector and manufacturing. Before 2014 there was a surge of investment into various sectors, including pharmaceuticals and automotives. Flagship companies-such as AvtoVAZ, a carmaker that makes the Lada, and Rosneft, a state-owned oil firm-have been allowed to sell stakes to foreign multinationals. However, with the intensification of the geopolitical stand-off between Russia and the West over Russia's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, some major foreign firms have started to reduce exposure to the Russian markets. New investment in manufacturing and retail has sunk sharply in the wake of the devaluation of the rouble and ongoing recession. Most of the FDI stock is in Moscow, the capital, and St Petersburg, as well as energy-producing regions like Arkhangelsk and Sakhalin. Five of the 83 regions account for more than 70% of inward FDI. Prior to the latest crisis some new FDI locations had started to become important-for example, an industrial cluster in the Kaluga region (supported by business-friendly policies from the local authorities), which includes an industrial project of Volkswagen (a German carmaker) and several greenfield schemes.
Determinants
In the years running up to the crisis of 2008-09, good market opportunities, as well as improvements in the business environment, resulted in a sharp increase in FDI inflows. The attractions of natural resources, high returns on investment and a fast-growing market helped to counteract investor concerns about the security of property rights, corruption and the absence of a level playing field. The comparative attractiveness of Russian regions depends more on the regional authorities' will than on more challenging factors, such as geography, the existence of a skilled workforce or impressive infrastructure. Among determinants of FDI, investors were most interested in the legal environment, and financial and tax incentives. Perceptions of political risk, international sanctions and geopolitical tensions are likely to be the main determinants of FDI over the forecast period (2019-23). International sanctions will restrict investment into the financial, defence and hydrocarbon sectors (which will also suffer as a result of low energy prices).
Impact
Given a strong current-account position and the generally small size of FDI inflows, the impact of FDI on the balance of payments has been negligible. In addition, the sectoral distribution of FDI (to energy, and to ventures mainly serving domestic demand for traditional products) has had limited impact on technological capacity and competitiveness. Foreign investors have played a vital role in only a few industries (for example, beer, tobacco and automotives). Foreign banks expanded rapidly before 2014 but never controlled more than one-third of the financial sector. They are likely to lose market share to state-backed banks over the forecast period. More than 90% of current investment in fixed capital is under full Russian control. Companies with foreign participation employ only about 5% of the Russian workforce.
Potential
There exists wide potential for higher FDI in Russia, for instance in the underdeveloped hi-tech sector or in the energy sector for the exploration of Arctic oil and gas reserves. However, FDI will remain constrained by international financial sanctions that the EU and the US started to impose on Russia in 2014. Most notably, sectoral sanctions specifically target the energy, defence and financial sectors, and restrict the export of dual-use, oil-drilling and defence equipment to Russia, making investment in these sectors extremely difficult. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that these sanctions will remain in place over its forecast period. East-West tensions will remain high, Western banks will remain reluctant to finance large-scale projects in Russia for fear of sanctions and the Russian business environment will remain difficult. As a result, FDI to Russia will remain severely constrained in the long term.

From 2014 onwards population data include Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in March 2014 following an illegal referendum that has not been recognised by the international community. This artificially added 2.9m people to Russia's population statistics. The inclusion of Crimea in Russia's demographic projections reflects the fact that Russia's national accounts include economic activity on the Crimean peninsula, whereas Ukraine's national accounts data do not.
Russia suffered a major demographic shock after the fall of the Soviet Union
Russia suffered a serious demographic shock following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The population shrank by 5.3m between 1993 and 2008, when it picked up slightly owing to increasing immigration. The natural decrease during this period amounted to about 12m people. The mortality rate has exceeded the birth rate for more than 20 years owing to low fertility rates, below-standard healthcare and poor lifestyles. The stress of the transition to capitalism in the 1990s further contributed to falling birth rates and increased morbidity.
The decline in population would have been even greater had there not been considerable net migration into Russia over this period. A large proportion of foreigners come from other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). With the onset of the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, more than 1m refugees from eastern Ukraine are reported by UN agencies to have moved to Russia. At the start of 2015 the government replaced its quota system for economic migrants with a new regime imposing strict rules for obtaining work permits for citizens outside the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Citizens of EEU countries (which include Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic, both large sources of inward migration to Russia) can remain indefinitely in any other EEU country, as long as they have a valid employment contract.
Average male life expectancy in Russia declined significantly in the 1990s and was still below 60 as late as 2005. There has been some recovery since then, and life expectancy at birth is currently about 65 years for men and 76 years for women. Alcoholism accounts for much of the gap in life expectancy. Just 11% of Russian women smoke daily, compared with more than 40% of men. Heart disease and high blood pressure are among the main causes of premature death, along with car accidents (especially in northern regions). The incidence of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS is underreported but high, especially in remote regions.
Population decline will resume over the forecast period
The population has stabilised over the past five years as a result of immigration, an improvement in health and a rise in the birth rate-a result of a larger cohort of women of child-bearing age. The birth rate in 2018 stood at 12.8 per 1,000, up from 9.8 in 2005. The mortality rate per 1,000 people stood at 13.5 in 2018, down from 16 in 2005.
The government's long-term plan aims to lower the mortality rate, raise birth rates and improve health outcomes. The plan includes financial incentives to encourage women to have children. Over the past five years the government has introduced some health measures, such as banning tobacco advertising and smoking in public places and increasing taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. These moves may contribute to a modest improvement in life expectancy over the medium term.
Despite modest gains in life expectancy, The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that annual population growth will be negative in the 2019-23 forecast period (it was positive in every year in 2008-17). Government incentives are unlikely to have a major impact on the birth rate, and the share of women aged 20-29 is forecast to fall significantly in 2019-23.
Population is ageing rapidly
Russia has an ageing population, which will prove increasingly difficult to support. We project that the labour force will fall by 1.5m, or 2%, between 2018 and 2023. In 2018 the government raised the pension age by five years for women (to 60) and five years for men (to 65, in the region of the male life expectancy). Despite this recent reform, pension liabilities will remain a growing burden on the public finances in the coming years, all the more so as reforms of pension benefits are highly controversial and the authorities remain wary of triggering potential social unrest. Immigration from Central Asia will continue to provide a large pool of flexible, low-cost labour-much of it in the grey economy.

The Russian economy contracted sharply in 2015 (in US dollar terms) owing to the drop in global oil prices, and fell further in 2016, but it remains the 12th-largest economy globally (in nominal terms). Combined with high inflation (which weighed on real wages), the devaluation and subsequent depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar in 2014-16 has sharply reduced household spending power. The combination of the confrontation with the West (which will depress investment), stagnating global energy prices and slow movement on vital structural economic reforms will damage Russia's medium-term economic growth potential, with a concomitant impact on household income and wealth.
GDP per head (at purchasing power parity) reached a high of US$26,177 (58% of the German level) in 2013. It fell to US$24,620 in 2015, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that it recovered to its pre-crisis levels in 2018. It will now increase steadily, to about US$32,000 in 2023.
Wages contracted sharply in 2015, falling by almost 10% in real terms, and rebounded by only 0.9% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017. We estimate that they started to rebound in 2018, growing by an estimated 7.8%, as a result of low inflation, minimum wage rises and a pick-up in economic growth. The scale of the decline in income is likely to have been sufficient to trigger long-lasting shifts in household spending patterns, with a greater emphasis on price competitiveness and basic household goods.
Average incomes will recover slowly, but the luxury market will remain robust
Income inequality remains high and the market for high-end luxury goods will remain one of the strongest in Europe. Sales of passenger cars have been in decline since 2012, before the current economic crisis, but sales of luxury foreign brands such as Porsche and BMW (both of Germany) have fallen by much less. The car industry has started to recover in 2017, but passenger-car sales are projected to be well below the 2012 peak even in 2020. Further state support for the domestic car industry is likely, such as through vehicle scrappage schemes under which consumers can get discounts on the purchase of a new vehicle if they scrap their old vehicle. First introduced in 2014, it has been renewed on a regular basis ever since, and the government is considering plans to extend the scheme to trucks. The government has also allotted Rb10bn (US$172m) in 2017 for car leasing and loans to support customers in buying cars. Further market stimulus programmes came into effect in July 2017, offering subsidies to families with two dependent children.
Russian sanctions on EU food imports will remain
Russia is expected to maintain its ban on EU and US food imports throughout the forecast period (2019-23). This will help to boost domestic agricultural production across a range of food products. However, reduced access to domestic and external funding could crimp the expansion plans of domestic retail businesses. Public financing constraints and multiple claims on government funds are likely to restrict the investment in infrastructure and communications needed for consumer-centred businesses to thrive outside of the big cities.

Since his third presidential term, Vladimir Putin has adopted a more traditionalist, patriotic ideology. There has also been a more anti-Western tone since Russia's illegal military takeover of Crimea in March 2014. Some foreign companies could benefit from advertising, and marketing, campaigns that stress local content and branding, rather than luxury or foreign products, which had been more effective in the past. In many consumer segments, however, foreign brands will continue to be regarded as synonymous with higher quality. Further protectionist measures remain possible across a range of sectors, which could disrupt the operations of companies relying on crossborder supply chains. However, the authorities will continue to welcome investment to develop domestic production of established foreign brands.
Despite the weaker economic outlook, e-commerce has room for strong growth
New retail and consumer trends, in particular e-commerce, remain at an earlier stage of development than in western Europe, and are likely to grow significantly faster than the overall economy. The density of modern retail networks is still significantly below that of western Europe.

Russia's advantages for growth include an abundant natural-resource base, a low starting income and an educated workforce, but these are offset by institutional weaknesses, an overreliance on commodity exports, weak productivity growth and a poor demographic outlook. On the basis of Russia's initial conditions and UN demographic forecasts, as well as an assumption of limited policy improvement over the medium term, The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts average growth in real GDP and real GDP per head of less than 2% in 2019-50 (the long-term forecast period). Russia's share of the world economy, having expanded in 2000-08, will decline in the decades to 2050.
Skill levels compare favourably with those in many emerging markets
Initial conditions: Russia's natural resources are a mixed blessing. During much of the past decade high oil prices and favourable terms of trade were the main drivers of growth. However, there is a significant negative correlation between long-term growth and natural-resource dependency. This is a result of "Dutch disease"-whereby an overvalued exchange rate (as a result of commodity exports) prevents the development of globally competitive non-resource sectors-as well as of widespread opportunities for rent-seeking. Russia's size (about 17m square km) is an economic disadvantage, as it implies long distances between population, natural resources and business centres, as well as 11 different time zones. State involvement in the economy is high and has risen in recent years, and soft budget constraints have sustained a large number of internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms.
Workforce skill levels may still compare favourably with those in many emerging markets. In aptitude tests pupils perform close to the OECD average and significantly better than peers in many emerging markets. The number of adults with tertiary education is significantly above the OECD average, as a legacy of the excellent educational system of the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, over the past two decades Russia has suffered some deterioration in its human capital. Russia's technological resources are being depleted, as evidenced by the decline in the research and development sector and in the education system.
Demographic trends: The demographic profile is unfavourable, combining negative features of the developed and developing worlds (a falling and an ageing population, comparatively low life expectancy and a declining working-age population). The UN has revised up its baseline forecast for Russia's population, but the outlook remains poor, owing to low birth rates, below-standard medical care and a high mortality rate. Based on UN forecasts, we project that the population will decline to about 136m by 2050, down from 147m in 2017 (this includes the population of Crimea, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014). Crucially, the working-age population is likely to shrink even more quickly than that of the population as a whole.
A weak demographic outlook weighs on growth
In the absence of large-scale immigration-made difficult by domestic political considerations, widespread popular suspicion towards foreigners (especially from Western countries) as well as international tensions-Russia is unlikely to have the labour resources to sustain high rates of economic growth. Despite strong domestic opposition, the imperative to raise the retirement age will soon become irresistible, not least to sustain the pension system. However, poor health will continue to affect the quality of the workforce and make it all the more difficult to sustain the productivity improvements needed for catch-up growth. Investment in healthcare is likely to remain well below the OECD average as a share of GDP. The ageing population will impose increasing pension costs that will exert strong pressure on the budget and may act as a brake on reform. Despite the recent rise in the retirement age (to 60 for women, and 65 for men), the current pension system is inadequate to manage rising liabilities.
External conditions: Russia's energy-driven economy benefited greatly during most of the past decade from high oil prices and favourable movements in the terms of trade. This boost is likely to be absent over the longer term, however, as increased global supply and climate change policies hold down the value of Russia's main export. Tensions with the West are likely to endure for many years. This will depress foreign investment, place restrictions on the import of technological equipment (for instance for oil-drilling or dual-use goods), divert resources to military expenditure, and encourage statist and illiberal trends within Russia. A limited pivot to high-growth countries in Asia will yield some benefits, but economic integration will be constrained in the medium term, at least by deficiencies in infrastructure. The impact of climate change may be mixed: rising temperatures could boost agricultural yields in some areas, but increase the likelihood of wildfires and drought in others.
Competition is low and the regulatory burden high
Institutions and policy trends: Institutional deficiencies abound, and the concentration of economic power in a few massive conglomerates impedes competition. The institutional and policy outlook for growth is mixed. Sustained economic growth, especially beyond a certain level of development, requires a climate of political openness in which policies are subject to public scrutiny, minimising the scope for corruption and maximising the chances for good governance. The prospects for such an opening have been set back by the conflict with the West, which has strengthened authoritarian trends. International sanctions, which may last for many years given the unlikely prospects of a resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, have also consolidated groups within the policymaking elite that favour statist development models and import substitution, making it less likely that the economy will be opened up to greater competition. Attempts to reduce the regulatory burden on business can be expected, but an inefficient and cumbersome bureaucracy, as well as regional discrepancies, will hinder policy implementation. Far-reaching reforms to strengthen the rule of law and increase competition are not our core forecast, but remain possible. Russian per head income is already higher than the quality of the country's institutions would lead us to expect. Major reform could therefore deliver a much higher per head growth trajectory than currently forecast. However, given the consolidation of anti-Western attitudes within the elite, and the dominant role played by the security services, there is a risk that the government will respond to weak economic growth by further tightening social controls, while maintaining tensions with the West at a high level.
Long-term performance: An unfavourable demographic profile, difficult business environment, fragile banking sector, low productivity growth, absence of a culture of failure, weak institutions and over-reliance on natural resources will place strong constraints on Russia's long-term growth. Even with favourable assumptions about the expansion of the capital stock and continued productivity gains, excepting a dramatic change in Russia's political economy, we forecast average annual long-term real GDP growth well below 2%.
Given its strong industrial tradition and well-educated workforce, Russia's chances of diversifying its economy could be good, but this prospect has receded following a sharp deterioration in political and economic relations with the West. Even if the forecast rate of growth to 2050 is achieved, there will be only marginal catch-up with the advanced Western economies. Convergence prospects with developed Europe therefore appear poor.

Climate change and sustainability
This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Russian economy will be about 5% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth. A report released in March 2018 by Antistikhiya, a research centre affiliated to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations, estimates that the long-term economic cost of climate change could amount to Rb900bn (US$15.8bn, or about 1% of GDP). According to the report, average winter temperatures across Russia may rise by 2-5°C by the middle of the century. This would have a significant impact on Russia's northern territories. The Arctic Ocean is expected to be largely ice-free and navigable in the summer months by 2025-30, which could potentially allow for the Northern Sea Route to emerge as a major transit corridor between China and Europe (although major investment in infrastructure would be required). However, higher temperatures will also lead to the melting of permafrost in some northern areas, causing infrastructure-including roads, buildings and pipelines-to sink into marshes. Permafrost covers 65% of the country, and 93% of gas production and 75% of oil production is located in permafrost regions; in Siberia alone there are 350,000 km of energy pipelines. The energy sector already suffers from a high number of leakages and accidents; according to Greenpeace, an environmental campaign group, 35,000 accidents happen every year in western Siberia's oil and gas sector, 21% of which are owing to buckling pipelines. The impact of climate change on the agricultural sector will be mixed. Northern parts of the country will become more temperate, allowing for an increase in arable land. However, this will be offset by a decline in the productivity of regions further south and west, which will lead to increased incidents of droughts and wild fires. The Russian government has shown limited interest in pursuing policies to limit carbon emissions amid low popular concern about global warming.
International financial sanctions
In April and August 2018 the US Treasury imposed new rounds of sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. These sanctions marked a step-change in the US sanctions regime against Russia: for the first time the US government targeted internationally listed non-state companies operating outside the defence, energy and financial sectors (all three sectors were already targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2014). The direct macroeconomic impact of the sanctions is limited, and fluctuations in global oil prices will be a more important driver of economic growth in Russia over the long term. However, we believe that both US and EU sanctions will remain in place over the medium, and possibly the long term. As a result, the ability of the EU and the US to disrupt the operations of major enterprises is likely to be a source of significant concern for the Russian government. Crucially, non-US citizens and entities also face sanctions for conducting business with them because US sanctions apply to all transactions conducted in US dollars or by entities that have subsidiaries in the US, or are controlled by Americans. The Russian government might need to provide financial assistance to roll over loans and compensate for lost export earnings for some of the targeted companies that are effectively shut out of international financial markets because they cannot use US dollars. This could further reduce the funds available for infrastructure, education, healthcare, social spending and other long-term investment priorities. Partly as a result of sanctions, in recent years the Russian government has played an active role in developing an alternative financial architecture as a counterweight to the US (such as the BRICS-Brazil, India, China, South Africa-or "New" Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the expansion of mechanisms for conducting non-dollar denominated international transactions). For all the rhetoric of de-dollarisation, however, the sanctions have underlined the economic power asymmetries, and the limitations of Russia's pivot to the East. In the long run, the fact that the EU and the US effectively exert a veto on the ownership structure of major Russian companies will also be a cause for concern for the Russian government.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government, led by Alexis Tsipras of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), is likely to hobble along for just a few more months following the departure of the nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the coalition regarding the Macedonia name-change deal, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political instability to rise during of a busy electoral cycle in 2019, further weakening Greece's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform.
We forecast that an early election will be held before the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019, possibly in conjunction with the European Parliament and the May local elections. We expect New Democracy (ND) to win the most seats and to form a government. The centre-right party would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality in the medium term, until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's international creditors. Mr Tsipras's promises to lower taxes and reverse spending cuts could cause tensions with the EU and investors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
After expanding by 1.9% in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to 1.8% in 2019 and 2020 and an annual average of 2.1% in 2021-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 175% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove to be difficult.
Inflation (EU harmonised) is forecast to rise slightly, from 0.8% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2019 and 1.1% in 2020, reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and weaker global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to increase, bringing inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect moderate current-account deficits in 2019-23 (the forecast period).

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period, with progress in almost all categories, apart from political stability. However, Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions, which will constrain real GDP growth, and keep Greece's debt burden high.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% (29% in 2018) and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to an estimated 2.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The government led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) is in its final stage. In early January 2019 the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) dropped out of the ruling coalition in protest against the Macedonia name-change deal, depriving the government of a stable majority in parliament. Syriza has just 145 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The government had to rely on the help of members of the opposition and AE defectors to survive a vote of confidence on January 16th and get the Macedonia agreement through parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Syriza minority government to attempt to pass legislation aimed at boosting its electoral support before the next general election, but it is unlikely to survive more than a few months. Local and European Parliament elections are scheduled for May, and the general election is due by October, but we expect the general election to be called early, possibly in conjunction with the elections in May.
Political instability has intensified owing to the agreement with Macedonia to change that country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. This is likely to lead to a further weakening of the country's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform ahead of Greece's busy 2019 electoral cycle.
In August 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. During his period in power Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election. We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could lead to delays in the implementation of the debt-relief measures agreed with Greece's EU creditors.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in opinion polls; the gap has exceeded 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, which is likely to have increased owing to the Macedonia name-change deal, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability and protracted economic and financial crises have limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans. Recent government efforts to restore influence, including the Macedonia name-change deal and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. Ratification of the name-change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership, but the leader of ND has said that if elected, his government would seek to renegotiate the deal.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey will persist. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Turkey's release in August 2018 of two Greek soldiers arrested in March of that year while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line. In June 2018 Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs, to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
However, the government will still be subject to severe policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond, until its huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was an estimated 184% of GDP at end-2018, and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance will be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries.
The implementation of further debt-relief measures also agreed with Greece's EU creditors in June 2018 will be conditional on quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments, the most pressing of which include tackling Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, reviving the government's privatisation programme, removing remaining capital controls and clearing state arrears to the private sector. Greece has also committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. As the quarterly reviews will be published (the most recent was released on February 27th and updated on April 4th), transgression by Greece could adversely affect market access. The debt-relief measures include a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). Greece will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2018-22.
In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. After a three-year absence Greece has tapped the financial markets five times since July 2017, most recently in early March 2019 with a well-subscribed ten-year issue, yielding 3.9%. The spread on the secondary market between Greek ten-year government bonds and equivalent German government was about 380 basis points in early April. Amid rising domestic political instability ahead of the next general election in Greece, as well as and growing global economic and financial uncertainty, further issuance will be challenging.
In the medium and long term, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
After almost a decade of austerity Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP and a primary surplus of 3.9% in 2017, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 1.75%. From 2018, however, we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits and primary surpluses falling short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint ahead of the next general election and only moderate economic growth. There is also uncertainty about the application of the Council of State's ruling that previous pension and bonus cuts implemented in 2016 were unconstitutional, raising the risk of retroactive payments. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be more than 175% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below; it also launched an asset-purchase programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn and came to an end in December 2018. Nevertheless, policy will remain ultra-loose in the medium term as the ECB reinvests principal payments from maturing securities. Economic activity in the euro zone softened in 2018, and growth will slow further this year. Together with a more subdued outlook for commodity prices in 2019-20, we expect this to prompt the ECB to hold off on normalising its policy stance this year. At its last meeting, on March 7th, the bank delayed its next rate rise until late 2019 at the earliest. It also announced a third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), starting in September. We expect a 25-basis-point increase in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020 as underlying price pressures build. Policy tightening should then proceed at a gradual pace. An increase in the deposit rate, currently at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Real GDP accelerated from 1.4% in 2017 to 1.9% in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final three months of last year, contracting by 0.1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained at 1.8% in 2019 and 2020 and at an annual average of about 2.1% in 2021-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
A combination of more-and higher-taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts will continue to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2019-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 12% year on year in 2018, leaving fixed investment still about 65% below its 2007 peak. We expect a pick-up from this year, to an annual average of 5.2% in 2019-23. Underinvestment during the crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4% in 2019-23, down from 8.8% in 2018. However, the Greek tourism sector faces considerable challenges that range from the UK's planned departure from the EU and increased competition from Turkey to insufficient public investment.
How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine if the country remains in the euro zone. Although the risk of Grexit has abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and a sharp decreases in global oil prices in the final quarter of 2018 will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect inflation to rise modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018 to an annual average of 1% per year in 2019-20 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of quantitative easing (QE) tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. After peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in early February 2018, the euro has depreciated gradually. This was a response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, which increased political risk in the region, and to monetary tightening in the US. More recently, the euro has hovered around US$1.14:EUR1-at lower levels than we had anticipated-on the back of softening momentum in the euro zone. We expect it to appreciate gradually throughout 2019 as growth in the bloc picks up again in the second half of the year and momentum in the US slows. We forecast that the euro will average US$1.16:EUR1 in 2019 and will continue appreciating throughout our forecast period, to US$1.22:EUR1 in 2020-21, as monetary policy in the euro zone is tightened gradually, and to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23, supported by the large current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but also partly of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2018-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufacturing goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. As oil prices fall in 2019-20, adjustments to the official rate will have to be made to safeguard foreign-exchange reserves.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate (currently at 14%) from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
The multiple exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Oil prices and exports will fall in 2019-20 but so will imports. Both imports and exports will then expand in 2021-23 but a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but as oil prices decline, the naira weakens anyway as foreign-exchange inflows lessen.
2021-23: A premium between the official and the black-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will see the fiscal cost of the civil service increase markedly.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and so hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically once the 2019 elections are concluded, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts national savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and the army soon became the dominant political player. Multiparty democracy was restored in 1999. That presidential poll and the next one, in 2003, were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election and in 2019 Mr Buhari went on to win another term, with a clear lead over his main rival, Atiku Abubakar.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties dominate the political process. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the only political party to attract nationwide support, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015. Although the 36 state governments enjoy significant autonomy, almost all remain dependent on the federal government for funding.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is contentious, and currency liberalisation will be postponed whenever foreign-exchange supplies permit.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. Tax compliance is a time-consuming process.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus, although it has partly recovered since. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by an overvalued exchange rate and massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
An election on February 23rd resulted in a comfortable margin of victory for Muhammadu Buhari, who was running for a second term as president. However, the vote was tarnished by low turnout nationwide. To some extent this can be explained by a week-long, last-minute delay to the polling date, but there was an especially low turnout in the south of the country (where it dropped to only 18% in one state). This affirms a strong sense of apathy in that part of Nigeria and a clear disengagement from federal politics.
Given that the economically vital southern regions have a history of separatist sentiment and militancy, the disconnect between the population there and mainstream Nigerian politics bodes poorly for stability. There are added reasons to expect unrest in the south in particular, with the government likely to concentrate its energy on developments in the north. An Islamist militant group, Boko Haram, is resurgent in the north and north-east, and is utilising new tactics and more sophisticated hardware. Mr Buhari's "zero tolerance" approach to the group was a major reason for strong turnout and support for him in the affected states. As was the case in his last tenure, substantial federal resources are likely to be channelled towards keeping Boko Haram at bay. However, militants in the oil-producing south cite the use of oil earnings for far-flung causes such as combating Boko Haram-rather than for local development-as justification for launching attacks. It is a dilemma that cannot be resolved without reforming the distribution of federal hydrocarbons revenue and possibly the entire oil sector, but Mr Buhari is not an advocate of doing either. So it seems likely that attacks by aggrieved militants on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem, albeit isolated to the south.
Boko Haram will probably be aggressively countered, but in the process the north-east of Nigeria will essentially become a low-level conflict zone. Just to the south of this region, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, a more insoluble challenge will be addressing extremely violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for increasingly scarce water and land resources. Formal land titling is a potential answer, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Moreover, in Mr Buhari's first term, it was clear that military engagements in other parts of Nigeria have priority when it comes to deploying the army's thinly spread resources, and the same is likely to be true in his second, leaving the conflict to intensify. Again, the direct security impact will be localised, with little spillover into the administrative capital, Abuja, or the economic capital, Lagos. The entire country will feel the secondary effects, however, in the form of constricted food supply and high consumer prices.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Nigeria's national elections took place on February 23rd, and were marred by violence, delays and voter apathy, but Mr Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) secured 56% of the vote. Participation across the country, at 35%, was well down on the 44% turnout rate in 2015, partly reflecting a delay to the poll but also disengagement with the two main candidates. There was especially low participation in the south-a traditional People's Democratic Party (PDP) stronghold-with voters there evidently feeling alienated by the two main candidates (who are both northern). Mr Abubakar wants to contest the result in court, but the margin of victory for Mr Buhari is too wide for there to be any credible chance of him overturning it. Moreover, although international observers reported shortcomings in the management of the election, it was not deemed to be systemically unfair. The parliamentary election gave the APC a majority in both houses; in theory this should allow for the swift passage of legislation, but Mr Buhari's first term was marked by divisions between the executive and parliament (as had happened to presidents before him), and crucial bills including the national budget were delayed by months. As legislators typically prioritise the interests of their constituents over party and federation in Nigeria, similar tensions could easily reoccur in Mr Buhari's second stint. The next election will be in 2023, and a new APC presidential candidate will stand. Custom dictates that after two terms for a northerner, the next APC and PDP nominees will be from the country's south.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian import restrictions) could strain ties. Relations with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be a priority and not become formal policy. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies, and Mr Buhari will not willingly attempt to dismantle consumer price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system will be off-putting to investors fearing a return of capital controls. Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but again no structural reforms (such as full or partial privatisation) will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC become profitable rather than relinquish state control over them entirely, although there has been official talk of reducing the parastatal's stake in joint ventures with multinationals. Even this, however, would leave open questions around fiscal terms and revenue management in the oil sector. Multinationals, the NNPC's powerful union and local politicians (not to mention militant groups) will all pull in different directions. In practice there will be few improvements in the NNPC's performance, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to widen tax coverage (including through consumer taxes) and collect overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Instability in many parts of the country will be another impediment to collection. Hydrocarbons earnings will be held back by petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue), and budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day (b/d)-a level not seen for well over a decade, and one that will be unobtainable given underinvestment, antiquated oil infrastructure and the government's compliance with OPEC output guidelines. Despite a new offshore oilfield coming on stream, total production stood at 1.6m b/d in January. In all, federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.7% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2023 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the roll-out of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, flexibility on spending will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit equal to 2.1% of GDP over 2019-23. If the government moves to sells stakes in its upstream oil assets, which will be difficult politically, it would provide a dramatic one-off boost to the public finances.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20, notwithstanding small rate cut by the CBN in March. Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise over 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above-or-around target. However, real interest rates will be too high to support private-sector activity outside of highly profitable ventures.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. Tight monetary conditions and limited private investment-aggravated by cuts to public capital spending-presage a year of slow growth in 2019. We forecast growth of 2.1%, the lowest rate in the five-year outlook period. Growth will increase in 2020 as election-related uncertainty passes, but only marginally as an expected slowdown in the world economy holds back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and external demand picks up, the rate of growth will quicken, although remain well below potential at an annual average of 3.3%.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and falling oil prices in 2019-20 will hold back investment in infrastructure upgrades. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will be a new driver of output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism affecting trade, tight credit conditions affecting areas such as real estate and finance, and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will increase to 12.7% in 2019, as pre-election giveaways (including an increase in the minimum wage) and a small devaluation of the naira add to upward price pressures. Inflation will remain elevated at 11.4% on average in 2020 on the back of further currency weakening. Thereafter, as the currency stabilises, inflation will ease over the rest of the forecast period to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Preventing a faster slide will be widening protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food and manufactured goods. Currently 43 items are barred from foreign exchange access, the most recent addition being textiles, and the CBN wants to increase the list to 50 as a means of stimulating non-oil economic activity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. For this reason the set-up is not expected to be tampered with. Oil prices, and with them the level of hard-currency earnings, will in large part dictate where the authorities are able to hold the official rate and what the premium is between it and market-sensitive rates. In 2019 lower oil prices will cause the market-determined Nafex rate to drop and the official rate will do likewise from N306.5:US$1 at end-2018 to N319.5:US$1 at end-2019. With oil prices forecast to decline again in 2020 we expect a further fall in the value of the naira, to N337:US$1 at end-2020. As oil prices pick up on average over the rest of the forecast period and import pressures are eased by improved domestic refining capacity, we broadly expect the naira to stabilise, with an average rate of N338.4:US$1 in 2023.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The export profile will move in tandem with oil production trends and world crude prices. In 2019-20 limited output gains will be outweighed by a drop in world crude prices. Only in 2021-23 when prices recover and Nigeria begins to sell refined oil overseas (a new mega-refinery being developed is expected to be export-oriented) will there be any growth in earnings.
As Nigeria imports most of its petrol, lower world crude prices will ease pressure on the import bill in 2019-20. In 2019 there will even be a sharp drop in imports relative to 2018, when there was a one-off surge in capital goods imports. Wider restrictions on foreign-exchange access and a weakening naira will also hold back consumer demand. In 2020 world oil prices will decline further and the naira will continue to depreciate, but slightly stronger economic growth will nonetheless cause imports to edge up that year. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23, the naira stabilises and world oil (and so petrol) prices rise, imports will then grow faster. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will broadly track movements in world oil prices, narrowing from 2.3% of GDP in 2019 to 1.1% of GDP in 2020, then widening again to 2.5% of GDP by 2023.

Full text: Germany--highlights: Political outlook
The grand coalition-comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)-that took office in March 2018 will remain in power until the next election, in 2021. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU leader since December 2018, will become more vocal in domestic and international debates, but this will not create frictions with Angela Merkel, who has held the position of chancellor since 2005. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Ms Merkel to resign as chancellor before 2021 and she will work with Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer to ensure a smooth transition of power. A series of state elections taking place this year will confirm a higher degree of political fragmentation, and instability will remain high by German standards in 2019-23 (the forecast period).

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Germany's score in our business environ-ment rankings improves slightly between the historical period (2014-18) and the forecast period-faster improvements elsewhere mean that Germany slips in the global and regional rankings. The main strengths of the business environment are political stability, a highly skilled labour force, openness to trade and investment, and well-developed (if ageing) infrastructure. A strong research and innovation framework is another advantage. Faults include a high tax burden on labour income and on firms, alongside high administrative costs. Germany's open economy is also exposed to a slowdown in global trade flows and rising geopolitical tensions. The economy is comparatively well prepared to face technological changes.
Germany--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP growth (%) 1.5 1.0 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.8
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 1.9 1.6 1.5 1.9 2.0 2.0
Budget balance (% of GDP) 1.8 0.8 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.3
Current-account balance (% of GDP) 7.6 6.7 6.6 6.3 6.4 6.7
3-month Treasury rate (av; %) -0.3 -0.2 0.4 0.9 1.4 1.6
Exchange rate [euro]:US$ (av) 0.85 0.86 0.82 0.82 0.81 0.81
We forecast average annual real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2019-23, driven in large part by consumer spending, in the light of a tightening labour market, solid wage growth and low borrowing costs. Fiscal policy will become slightly more expansionary (although still highly prudent), and public investment and construction activity will support investment. We expect substantial (if gradually declining) current-account surpluses, despite external pressure for Germany to do more to boost domestic demand. The main risks to the short-term outlook are external, with a more protectionist global trade environment, driven mainly by tariff impositions by the US, being the most pronounced. In the longer term the weak demographic outlook will weigh more heavily on economic growth.
Germany--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2013 2018 2023

Population growth   0.5 0.0
Working-age population growth   0.1 -0.6
Labour force growth   0.8 0.4
Germany's demographic outlook is challenging, even in a European context. Long-standing natural decline, as deaths outnumber births, combined with political constraints on net immigration mean that the population will grow only marginally over the forecast period. The working-age population will start to decline, and the average age will rise, putting pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, and exacerbating labour shortages. The influx of migrants in 2015 will only partly offset this trend; successfully integrating these newcomers into the labour market will require significant policy efforts.
Germany--highlights: Market opportunities
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
GDP (US$ bn at market exchange rates) 4,006 4,030 4,395 4,500 4,745 4,912
GDP per head (US$ at market exchange rates) 48,363 48,647 53,055 54,297 57,247 59,283
Personal disposable income (US$ bn) 2,284 2,326 2,521 2,587 2,717 2,791
Household consumption (US$ bn) 2,100 2,138 2,323 2,390 2,518 2,592
Household consumption per head (US$) 25,360 25,810 28,040 28,830 30,370 31,290
Germany will remain the world's fourth-largest economy at market exchange rates in 2023. Germany is the largest consumer market in Europe by population, and market opportunities will be supported by the tight labour market and solid wage growth in the forecast period. The country's changing age profile will do much to shape demand, particularly in the area of leisure services for the large retired population. The consumer market will continue to be characterised by a preference for inexpensive goods for most day-to-day needs and high-quality purchases in special circumstances.
Germany--highlights: Long-term outlook
  2019-30 2031-50 2019-50
Growth and productivity (% change; annual av)
Growth of real GDP per head 1.5 1.5 1.5
Growth of real GDP 1.5 1.3 1.4
Labour productivity growth 1.8 1.5 1.6
In the long-term forecast period the economy's growth will be constrained by markedly poor demographics. Real GDP growth will ease from an average of 1.5% in 2019-30 to 1.3% in 2031-50, although on a per-head basis the rate of growth will remain broadly steady. Notwithstanding demographic headwinds, Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and openness to innovation. It needs more reform, including of the pension system, progress on which we expect to be slow.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45) Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be brought down only by the election of a successor. In March 2018 a grand coalition was once again formed, comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Policy issues: Internationally, the government's agenda will include the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK; EU reform efforts, in collaboration with the French president, Emmanuel Macron; managing relations with the US president, Donald Trump, especially over trade issues; and shaping the EU's response to Russia, in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Domestically, the government aims to ensure a sustainable medium-term budget surplus, increase investment spending, ensure continued progress on its Industry 4.0 agenda and shift away from nuclear energy.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%.
Foreign trade: Export earnings picked up to US$1.4trn in 2017, from US$1.3trn in 2016. Import costs also picked up, to US$1.1trn, from US$1trn. This resulted in a rise in the goods trade surplus, to US$303.5bn; The EU is still the single largest goods export market for Germany, but it has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Germany is a federal democracy, with major powers delegated to the 16 states (Länder). In March 2018 the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) reformed their grand coalition following a difficult and protracted coalition-building process. The bicameral parlia-ment comprises the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), whose members are elected on a system of modified proportional representation, and the Bundesrat (the upper house), which consists of representatives of the 16 state governments. The coalition has a majority in the Bundestag, but not in the Bundesrat.

a Before the 2005 election, the Party of Democratic Socialist (PDS) merged with a new group, the Election Alliance for Jobs and Social Justice (WASG). The joint party was named the Left Party. Before 2005 the results relate to the PDS alone.
Political outlook: Political stability
Germany has experienced an unusual degree of political stability in recent years, in a European context, with Angela Merkel, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), holding the post of chancellor since 2005. However, since late 2017 political instability has increased as the political landscape has become more fragmented. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects significant political change in the years ahead, although German politics will remain highly centrist and driven by consensus.
In the September 2017 federal election the CDU and its smaller Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), won the largest share of the vote. The centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) had its worst result in the post-war period and initially announced that it would go into opposition. However, after no other workable coalition options could be found, a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and the SPD took office in March 2018, which became the third grand coalition led by Ms Merkel after similar administrations in 2005-09 and 2013-17. One consequence of the two "big-tent" parties repeatedly governing together is that the difference between them has become blurred. This has hurt their public support and has contributed to a reshaping of the political landscape. When Ms Merkel first took on the chancellorship in 2005 the CDU/CSU and the SPD held 73% of the seats in the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament). This share has now fallen to 56%. Parties that take a clear line on migration and openness have benefited most from the fall in support for the mainstream parties-notably the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is the largest opposition party; and the centre-left The Greens, which stand for an open Germany.
At the party conference in December 2018 Ms Merkel chose not to run for re-election as the CDU leader-a role that she had held since 2000. In part, this reflected her view that the CDU would need some time to reinvent itself under a new leader before contesting the 2021 federal election. Ms Merkel's preferred successor and the continuity candidate, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, won the nomination, although only by a small margin. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was chief minister of the state of Saarland in 2011-18 and became general secretary of the CDU in February 2018, so brings significant experience to the role. Like Ms Merkel, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer strives for consensus, has a strong religious basis for her values and is broadly centrist in her economic policy positioning. However, she is more socially conservative-she voted against gay marriage and intends to take a tougher stance on migration.
Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's first challenge is to unite the liberal and conservative wings of the party. Her second is to convince party members that she is not just a "mini-Merkel". A shift towards the right on some issues could open up space for the SPD to define itself on the left, potentially giving some new energy to the political debate in Germany. We expect the government to last a full term, as none of the coalition parties would benefit from an early election. Ms Merkel has said that she intends to serve out her term as chancellor, but we believe that there is a high probability that she will step down early to give Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer the best possible chance of winning the chancellorship in 2021.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The quality of administration is high, and the implementation of policies that have been passed by the federal parliament is sound. The federal structure of the government means that considerable responsibility falls on the 16 states that constitute the federal republic. An advantage of this is that many issues are decided with the closer democratic involvement of the electorate. States have a strong incentive to improve their own quality of governance, as comparisons with other states are easy to make, although one drawback is that the quality of public services such as education remains heterogeneous across states. Another disadvantage is that co-ordination can be troublesome in policy areas in which the states have a large role. This has been the case in recent years. For instance, although the federal government had allocated additional funds for infrastructure investment, lower governments were often unable to use these for additional investment owing to capacity constraints.
The design of the system also means that the constitutional powers enjoyed by the Bundesrat may, on occasion, limit the ability of the federal government to push through reforms in the face of opposition at state level. However, the upper house does not have the right of veto on all aspects of legislation, and the proportion of laws requiring its approval was reduced in 2006. The last of these changes aimed to reduce the share of legislation requiring Bundesrat approval from about 60% to 35-40%, but the actual impact has been less dramatic. In exchange for this loss of influence over federal legislation, the states now have greater influence over the implementation of federal laws and have gained some additional powers, particularly in education.
Majority governments are the norm in Germany, at both the federal and the state levels. This generally ensures smooth policymaking, as the coalition agreement usually sets out in advance what the government will be working on throughout its term. In the coming years We expect increased pressure on policymaking at the federal level, as the coalition is more fractured than in its previous term. The SPD's wish to differentiate itself more clearly from the CDU, as it performed poorly in opinion polls since the 2017 election, will hamper effective policymaking. Nevertheless, the nomination of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as the leader of the CDU could create some space for manoeuvre for the SPD. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer shares Angela Merkel's centrist stance on the economic agenda, but is more socially conservative. Relations between the governing parties will remain shaky, but government effectiveness will not be severely undermined as Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's influence in shaping domestic and international debate grows.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next federal election is scheduled for 2021. Elections will be held for the European Parliament and the state parliament of Bremen in May 2019. State elections will also be held in Brandenburg and Saxony in September, and in Thuringia in October-three of the five states that made up the former east Germany. These will be closely watched given the strength of the AfD's support in east Germany, where voters' dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the 2015-16 migration crisis have fed into deeper frustrations about the lack of convergence between the east and the west of the country since reunification.
Political outlook: International relations
The external environment has become a source of uncertainty in recent years. The UK's vote to leave the EU, strains over migration, and the challenges to the bloc posed by Hungary and Poland have put pressure on the European community. Further afield, the actions of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan-the presidents of the US, Russia and Turkey respectively-are undermining the global rules-based order that Germany has always held as the gold standard.
Germany's support for euro zone reform has been lukewarm, but Ms Merkel has supported the idea of creating an EU army, and redesigning security and refugee policy. In the past few months Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer has taken the lead in promoting the CDU's vision for Europe, in an effort to boost her profile at home and abroad. We do not expect Germany's EU stance or influence in shaping the EU debate to change under Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's potential leadership. The country's position will continue to reflect the broad social German consensus against fiscal transfers within the bloc, as well as Germany's economic dominance.
Relations with the US, traditionally Germany's most important non-EU partner on the global stage, have worsened significantly during Mr Trump's presidency, and will remain strained in the forecast period (2019-23). The US president has publicly criticised Germany for its failure to meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP spending on defence, its reliance on Russian energy and its trade surplus with the US. Following an exchange of tariffs between the US and the EU in May-June 2018, the two factions agreed to start talks on a trade agreement for non-automotive industrial goods. Nevertheless, in February Mr Trump sharpened his rhetoric against the EU and reiterated his threat to raise tariffs on imported European cars. Mr Trump has until mid-May to act on undisclosed findings from the US Department of Commerce on whether imported cars pose a threat to national security. The risk of a collapse in the trade talks is high. Faced with US tariffs, we would expect the EU to respond in kind, albeit staying within the framework of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Germany took a decisive line against Russia, breaking with decades of relatively good relations and pushing against the reluctance of many southern and central European countries to impose far-reaching EU sanctions-a position that it has maintained ever since. We expect the EU sanctions to remain in place in the medium term, although pragmatic co-operation between Germany and Russia will continue, especially on energy.

Germany's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings increases slightly from 8.31 in the historical period (2014-18) to 8.37 in the forecast period (2019-23). However, owing to larger gains elsewhere, the country falls in the global and regional rankings. Germany was the seventh most attractive business location in the world in 2014-18, but it drops to tenth position in 2019-23, and the country's regional ranking declines from fourth to sixth place among its 17 peers. Strong fundamentals underpin Germany's high score and ranking for the macroeconomic environment, supporting an improvement in financing conditions. Declines in market opportunities and labour market categories reflect the poor demographic outlook and the increasingly acute labour shortages respectively. Overall, most of the scores in our business environment categories are expected to remain broadly stable-an indication of the previous coalition government's unadventurous policy agenda and our expectation that "reform fatigue" will endure in the coming years. This is disappointing given the fiscal space in Germany's public finances, the weaknesses that persist in the tax system and network infrastructure, and the country's demographic challenges.
Political stability will mainly be tested by region-wide issues
Germany's main strengths are its political stability, skilled labour force, openness to foreign trade and investment, and strong research and innovation framework. The political environment is reasonably robust, with a mature democratic system and efficient public administration, but stability will be tested by internal coalition pressures and region-wide issues related to immigration, Brexit, Russia and reform of euro zone structures. The tax regime places a substantial burden on labour income and on companies, alongside high administrative costs. The medium-term phase-out of nuclear power and coal-powered generation raises questions about the cost of renewables and energy supply security.

Business environment outlook: Germany's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The state maintains its involvement in the financial sector, railways and telecommunications. Firms' administrative burden is reasonable, but some areas of weakness remain. Protective regulation across the services sector persists.
2021-23: Limited prospects for reforming regulated service professions. Gradual shift towards increased state intervention.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government generally welcomes foreign direct investment, but Germany has lobbied hard to increase scrutiny at the EU level, and takeovers of major German media, infrastructure and finance companies now meet political resistance.
2021-23: Investment from China is increasingly unwelcome, given concerns about intellectual property leakage.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Pressure on German export sector from slowing global demand, ongoing US-China trade war and possible Brexit disruption. Risk of an escalation in trade tensions between the EU and the US. Risk of worsening EU-Russia relations.
2021-23: EU makes further gradual progress on bilateral trade deals. Expected decline in post-Brexit UK-EU crossborder trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Mild fiscal loosening, including targeted tax cuts via phased abolition of "solidarity surcharge", but a comparatively high labour tax burden persists. Deeper than expected economic slowdown could trigger modest discretionary stimulus.
2021-23: Incremental income-tax relief is likely amid pressure to strengthen work incentives for lower-income earners. Modest reform of management of corporate tax. Possible introduction of digital tax.
Financing
2019-20: Highly accommodative monetary policy has lowered banks' funding costs, but pressure on margins persists amid weak profitability and tighter regulation. Possible state-backed merger of struggling Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.
2021-23: Operating conditions for banks remain challenging. Ongoing efforts to attract financial services firms from the UK.
The labour market
2019-20: Unemployment remains low. Restrictions on temporary employment. Skilled-labour shortages worsen.
2021-23: Limited prospects for reform to address structural challenges arising from ageing demographics and increasing share of migrant workers. Increased provision of childcare facilities supports moderate rise in female participation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Modest rise in public infrastructure investment. Focus on maintenance of existing road and rail networks. Further delays in opening of flagship airport in Berlin, the capital. Continued calls from energy sector for improvement of power grid.
2021-23: Gradual phase-out of nuclear and coal generation, alongside rising renewables, expected to push up energy prices.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The government prioritises upgrading the country's digital infrastructure and investing in artificial intelligence.
2021-23: Efforts continue on "Industry 4.0", which focuses on upgrading manufacturing prowess through increased use of automation and connected systems. Increasing threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.

The robust economic upswing in recent years was supported by a resilient labour market, weak inflation, solid household finances, highly accommodative monetary policy from the European Central Bank (ECB) and a broad expansion of global demand. The external environment has weakened sharply since mid-2018, however, amid heightened world trade tensions and Brexit risks, softening growth in China and disruption in the automotive sector. These headwinds have contributed to weaker activity across the euro zone and a marked slowdown in Germany, reflecting the significant exposure of its export-oriented economy to world trade flows and fluctuating external demand. Near-term prospects remain weak, but solid fundamentals-healthy public finances, low unemployment, a competitive export sector, modest household debt and attractive financing conditions-will continue to underpin domestic demand. Alongside the country's strong institutional framework, this will sustain Germany's high global ranking for its macroeconomic environment throughout the forecast period.
Weaker global growth will, however, focus attention on structural supply-side challenges. Weak business investment and public infrastructure spending over the past decade, viewed alongside the government's limited reform plans, does not augur well for medium-term productivity and potential growth. Policy will also be tested by ageing demographics and a gradual decline in the working-age population (increasing the risk of skilled labour shortages), emerging strains in parts of the housing market and the disruptive impact of new technologies and shifting consumer demand on Germany's large automotive sector.
A substantial current-account surplus has long implied an inefficient allocation of resources, domestically and within the euro zone. It reflects an unusually large volume of domestic savings (that are mainly invested abroad), driven by fiscal conservatism, low investment and population ageing. An escalation in global trade protectionism represents the most serious risk to growth prospects in the forecast period, with firms also facing uncertainty over a (potentially chaotic) "no-deal" Brexit, weaker Asian demand and a cyclical downturn of the US economy.

Protective regulations across the business services sector will persist
Policy towards private enterprise and competition is generally liberal, and will remain so during the forecast period. Strengths include an effectively developed framework for research and innovation, a stable legal code and integrated supply chains across the EU. The competition authority, the Federal Cartel Office, has a solid reputation for being unbiased and efficient. However, Germany fares less well in other areas, with inefficiencies in the corporate tax regime, restricted competition in parts of the services sector and subdued entrepreneurial activity. The country's regulatory framework for companies is reasonable, but lags some of its regional peers. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 study, the administrative processes involved in accessing utilities and credit, obtaining permits, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency are fairly low. In contrast, the number of procedures and time taken to set up a new business are well above the average for high-income OECD countries, tax administration is often complex and costly, and registration of property can be protracted.
Liberalisation of product markets has progressed gradually, but regulations remain comparatively restrictive in some utilities and transport sectors, retail and business services. There has been negligible domestic reform in these areas and successive governments have resisted efforts to open up the EU services market to greater competition. EU-wide access to the German public procurement market is more restricted, and is less transparent than is the case in the UK and France.
Studies by the OECD and European Commission have showed Germany to have some of the most restrictive regulation in business services among all member states, in sectors including architecture, engineering, legal, accountancy and computer services. Vested interests imply limited prospects for reform, with the government showing little inclination to enact liberalising measures.
State involvement across the economy is moderate. Most domestic post-crisis emergency measures in the financial sector have been rolled back, but the state retains holdings in three recapitalised banks and will continue to oversee the run-off of substantial legacy assets in a Special Fund for Financial Market Stabilisation (SoFFin). A broad framework of state-owned regional and savings banks carries political clout, and restricts competition. The federal government wholly owns the state railway, Deutsche Bahn; holds a 32% share in the former national telecommunications monopolist, Deutsche Telekom; and has a 21% stake in the former postal monopoly, Deutsche Post.
In February 2019 the government proposed a revised national industrial strategy that implied a shift towards greater state intervention in industry sectors, support for "national and regional champions", and protection for firms deemed to be of "strategic importance" to the German economy. The plans reflect rising concern over the ability of EU-based firms to compete with US and Chinese rivals.
Reforms aimed at reducing firms' administrative burdens have been modest in recent years and no major changes are anticipated in 2019-23. A "bureaucracy relief" act in 2016 introduced a "one-in, one-out" rule for new regulations likely to impose costs on companies, and eased record-keeping requirements for start-ups.

FDI policy is fairly liberal, but there will be tighter screening of non-EU inflows
Policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) is relatively liberal, as in most EU countries, but sentiment towards non-EU inward FDI-particularly from China-is hardening and regulation will be tightened in the forecast period. Subsidies or financial incentives aimed directly at attracting FDI are limited, and focused mainly on research and development (R&D) support. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) is the federal body responsible for FDI affairs. A state-owned development bank, KfW, is the main provider of financial support. As in most countries, greenfield FDI is viewed as preferable to foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. Restrictions on hostile takeovers are considerable, whether the acquirer is foreign or domestic. Notice of strategic goals and "acting in concert" is mandatory for large investments. Constraints are more pronounced with respect to acquisitions of major utility companies, reflecting security of energy supply issues. According to data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2017 Germany had the ninth-largest stock of FDI in the world, and the fourth largest in Europe after the UK, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
The government will maintain its right to veto acquisitions of equity stakes above 25% in German companies by non-EU investors if these are deemed not to be in the national interest or pose a risk to national security. The veto has yet to be applied, but could be tested in the coming years amid a growing pushback (at domestic and EU level) against non-EU FDI inflows, particularly from China. A marked increase in such inflows in recent years has raised concerns over the potential transfer of technological knowledge and intellectual property, as well as the sale of strategic assets, especially in the case of investment by Chinese state-owned firms.
FDI rules were further tightened in late 2018, with the new regulation entering into force from 2019. The government can now block direct and indirect foreign investments when it involves at least a 10% stake on German companies working in critical sectors. Media has also been added to the list of covered sectors, which include energy, telecommunications, transport, information technology (IT) security, healthcare, water, food, finance, insurances, and related software and technology.
These moves have mirrored similar moves at EU level, with Germany supportive of European Commission plans to establish a regional framework for screening inward FDI on grounds of national security. A recent global trend has been an increasing share of FDI activity reflecting "corporate reconfigurations"-changes in multinational ownership structures-that often have a minimal impact on output, employment and capital in the host economy. This is expected to continue over the forecast period as firms' tax-planning practices continue to evolve.

Trade talks will focus on bilateral deals amid global trade tensions
Germany's foreign trade regime is defined by its EU membership. Free movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the EU, and we do not expect any exchange controls. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the bloc, and the EU has abolished most other non-tariff restrictions. The EU trades with Norway and Iceland under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), has a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland and a customs union with Turkey. Only agriculture is excluded from all these arrangements.
The EU will continue to abide by World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but-continuing the shift of recent years-the bloc's focus will be on bilateral trade deals, as support for progress through the multilateral trade system has frayed amid heightened opposition in many countries (notably the US) to further trade liberalisation. We expect the EU to make gradual progress, but the backdrop will be challenging, given the fall-out from the ongoing US-China trade war, a broader increase in global trade protectionist measures, the significant risk of a disruptive Brexit by the UK, an increased threat of additional US tariffs on imports of EU cars (which would result in a wider trade conflict as the EU defends its interests) and weaker global growth. There is a clear risk of an escalating chain reaction of measures, threatening a more dramatic fraying of the multilateral trade system.
The EU and Japan finalised an economic partnership agreement in July 2018, creating the world's largest free-trade area. The deal came into effect in February 2019; some tariffs will fall to zero this year, but for most measures there will be a lengthy transition phase in the next decade. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) will gradually come into force in 2019-23. CETA will eliminate most trade tariffs, simplify border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation. In April 2018 the EU and Mexico agreed in principle to a trade deal that would include a significant reduction of tariffs.
Our core forecast is that the UK and EU will ultimately reach some form of Brexit agreement (paving the way for, most likely, an even more protracted and antagonistic period of negotiations over a future trade deal). However, the UK's increasingly dysfunctional political landscape also implies a clear possibility of a disruptive no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all. Should the negotiations break down irrevocably, then the UK would leave the EU and revert to WTO trade rules. This would mean a significant increase in tariffs, as well as in non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU. The UK is Germany's fifth-largest export market, with the two countries interconnected by extensive financial, investment and supply-chain linkages (and with Germany also indirectly exposed to the UK's significant ties with the wider EU market). A no-deal Brexit would have a severe impact on UK-EU trade, weighing on business activity across Germany.

Tax burden will remain high on labour income and companies
The tax/GDP ratio in Germany has risen slightly over the past decade and stood at 40.5% in 2017 (latest available data), similar to the EU average and moderately below that for the euro zone (41.4%). Direct taxes on personal income and net social security contributions account for a higher than average share of overall tax receipts. A lower proportion of revenue is derived from taxes on corporate income, goods and services (such as value-added tax, VAT), on the environment and on property. There are three personal income tax rates, ranging from 14% to 45%, with the top rate levied on taxable income over EUR265,330. There is also a "solidarity surcharge"-a 5.5% levy on income that has been in effect since 1991 to finance reunification costs. The standard VAT rate is 19%, slightly less than the EU average, with a reduced rate of 7% on certain goods and services.
Despite robust jobs growth in Germany over recent years, the tax system is not that supportive of employment or private investment, with a relatively high tax burden on labour income and on companies. In 2017 the average single worker faced a tax wedge-the difference between workers' take-home pay and what it costs to employ them-of 49.7%, the second highest in the OECD, after Belgium. This high burden, including on low-income workers, acts as a disincentive for second earners and partly accounts for the modest full-time employment rate among women. The effective tax burden on firms is also elevated, even though the headline federal corporation tax rate is just 15%. After including the impact of a local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and solidarity surcharge, the effective average corporation tax rate is about 28%, compared with an EU average of about 21%. The country's tax system for firms is quite complex, with fairly high administration costs. Tax treatment favours debt over equity, which could hinder private investment and might partly account for Germany's underdeveloped venture capital market.
The public finances are robust by advanced economy standards, with the general government budget recording a fifth consecutive annual surplus in 2018. The government plans a modest fiscal expansion in 2019-20, mainly via a rise in public investment. With both coalition parties broadly supportive of a cautious fiscal stance, no significant overhaul of tax policy is expected.
The coalition government has agreed a phased abolition of the solidarity surcharge for most lower- and middle-income earners by 2021, which will offer some modest tax relief. Adjustments to social security contributions and welfare benefits in 2019 will have a negligible effect on the labour tax burden. We expect some targeted measures to incentivise business investment, building on recent reforms to the tax framework for start-ups and investment funds. A deeper-than-expected economic slowdown would probably trigger more fiscal intervention, although well-established automatic stabilisers and long-held fiscal conservatism will limit the prospects of a major discretionary fiscal stimulus.

Support for the financial sector will continue, amid slow reforms
Germany's financial sector was badly hit by the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Officials and regulators were slow to address the failings in the banking system, which had invested heavily in exotic asset-backed securities. In the past decade the underlying resilience of the sector has steadily improved, in response to major balance sheet restructuring and consolidation, and as banks have strengthened their capital and liquidity positions, and asset quality, amid tighter regulation, firmer GDP growth and supportive financing conditions. At end-2018 estimates of Tier 1 capital ratio were slightly above the regional average and the share of non-performing loans was modest. Huge monetary support from the ECB has kept banks' funding costs low and fostered an upturn in private-sector credit growth, but the protracted low-interest-rate environment has weighed heavily on bank profitability, which in Germany is among the weakest in the EU. There has been a modest shift towards commission- and fee-based revenue generation, but the business model of most German banks remains heavily geared towards interest income, leading to consistently low returns on equity. High operating costs, litigation pay-outs, pressure on margins from regulatory requirements and demands for digitisation have spurred large cost-cutting programmes and job losses across the sector, including at the two largest financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Amid a weakening economic outlook, more structural adjustments will most likely be required to avert a loss of investor confidence, and doubts will persist about the underlying strength of some state-owned regional lenders (Landesbanken), which faced huge losses during the crisis and remain in a weakened condition. Germany has an extensive network of (mostly non-profit) small local credit co-operatives and public-sector savings banks (owned by local authorities) that aim to service the Mittelstand. These account for the majority of credit institutions and are a major factor as to why retail banking in Germany is less profitable than in most other EU countries.
Private equity and venture capital markets remain relatively small
The credit cycle in Germany-and across the euro zone-firmed in 2015-17 amid improved economic conditions. According to ECB figures, total lending by financial institutions to the German private sector (including to other financial intermediaries) rose by 4.6% in 2017, a decade high, driven by faster growth in unsecured consumer credit and in lending to corporates. However, credit demand softened during the course of 2018, as economic conditions deteriorated, and we expect a period of more subdued lending growth in the coming years.
Internally generated funds account for an above-average share of corporate financing in Germany, reflecting firms' lower reliance on capital markets than in most large advanced economies. Equity capital accounts for the largest share of funding, but is below the EU average. Bank credit was traditionally the preferred financing channel, being comparatively cheap and available at long maturities, but demand has weakened over the past decade amid steady deleveraging. The private equity and venture capital markets are growing, but remain small in an international comparison. Securitisation and use of credit derivatives are common, but the market is less developed than in some other high-income countries.
Brexit-related disruption, regulatory changes and digitalisation costs could lead to additional capital needs for parts of Germany's financial sector. A state-backed merger of the country's two largest financial institutions-Deutsche and Commerzbank-is possible in the coming years, but may not address structural flaws. Brexit would create more opportunities for the expansion of Germany's financial services hub of Frankfurt, as regulatory requirements will mean that London's relative appeal as a financial centre partly diminishes.

Germany has a comparatively robust labour market, with a high employment rate, a record-low jobless rate (of about 3.2% of the labour force as at January 2019, far below the EU28 average of 6.5%), solid employer-employee relations, a statutory national minimum wage and a well-respected apprenticeship system. The rate of unemployment has fallen steadily in the past decade (from a peak of 11.2% in 2005) and the employment rate has trended higher, to about 80% at end-2018 (among those aged 20-64). Firm labour demand in recent years has been supported by robust cyclical economic growth, which is now weakening, but the impressive headline labour market indicators can also be traced back to the impact of contentious reforms implemented by past governments. Liberalising measures, tighter welfare eligibility, the decentralisation of wage bargaining and a long period of earnings restraint resulted in a strengthening of productivity, jobs growth and competitiveness during the 2000s, when most EU countries experienced a steady increase in labour costs. This policy approach was deeply unpopular with workers in Germany at the time-and constrained household spending-but has since underpinned the consistently high employment rate. Recent evidence would suggest that it has also contributed to lowering the rate at which unemployment generates wage inflation. Despite a record-low jobless rate and increasing labour shortages, average whole-economy earnings growth has remained subdued. Collective wage agreements since early 2018 point to a mild acceleration over the next couple of years, even as labour demand softens. The scope of collective agreements has declined gradually over recent years.
Reforms will be needed to strengthen the incentives for later retirement
There are some other less positive features of the labour market. Although the overall female employment rate is comparatively high (about 76% at end-2018), participation of women in full-time employment is modest, partly owing to limited childcare availability and tax disincentives for second earners. Since 2017 the government has implemented a number of reforms to strengthen childcare provision. About 5m Germans (mainly female) were employed in part-time, low-wage "mini-jobs" at end-2017. Across the economy as a whole, the share of low-skill, low-wage employment has risen steadily over the past decade. There is also a significant gap between the employment and inactivity rates of female EU and non-EU nationals (more so than for men), implying transition issues for those with a migrant background into the labour market, and underused labour resources. The employment prospects (and participation rate) of older workers have improved, but the challenges posed by Germany's ageing population mean that reforms will be needed to strengthen the incentives for later retirement (in contrast to a 2014 pension bill that expanded early retirement options) and improve lifelong learning policies.
Skilled labour shortages have been a topic of debate in Germany for some time, but business surveys suggest that the problem has become more acute over the past few years, with a growing proportion of firms-particularly SMEs-citing a lack of higher-skilled labour as having a negative impact on business operations. Germany's negative demographic trends mean that the situation is only likely to get worse. Inflows of migrant labour will help to some extent and Brexit could be beneficial, as the UK's diminishing status leads to the relocation of employees to Germany and the re-routing of some immigrants who might have otherwise gone to the UK. However, vacancy rates suggest that these arrivals will not be sufficient to meet labour demand. As the political mood is not conducive to greater immigration, the focus may need to shift to removing incentives for early retirement or encouraging higher female full-time employment.

Infrastructure is solid, but greater capital investment is needed
The quality of network infrastructure has traditionally been a strength of the business environment in Germany, but a lengthy period of subdued public and private capital investment has resulted in a gradual deterioration of standards, constraining progress in digitisation (which lags many of the country's peers) and raising capacity concerns in the energy transition policy (Energiewende) towards renewables. We expect some improvement in the forecast period in response to a moderately stronger trend in public investment, targeted primarily at digital infrastructure and social housing, although some weaknesses will persist. Transport infrastructure is well developed, but spending restraint has contributed to rising congestion and a backlog of repairs. The previous coalition government published a new Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (FTIP) in 2016, proposing expenditure of EUR270bn on about 1,000 projects up to 2030, with a majority of the intended funds allocated to maintenance of existing road and rail networks. However, the FTIP is more a basic framework for policy than a specific funding plan, with actual implementation dependent on attracting substantial private investment and overcoming regulatory hurdles (such as complex planning rules) and weak co-ordination between federal and local government. Ongoing airport investment will be underpinned by robust passenger demand, but construction of a new flagship airport, Berlin-Brandenburg, has been beset with problems and budget overruns. The scheduled opening has been repeatedly pushed back from 2011 to 2020, with further delays possible. The mobile telecoms and broadband markets are competitive, but Germany lags many of its peers in the provision of high-speed broadband services, with large regional and urban-rural disparities.
The post-Fukushima decision by the government in 2011 to phase out domestic nuclear power by 2022 has driven a steady shift towards renewables, subsidies for which have contributed to high household energy bills. Germany is making progress in expanding renewables generation (particularly solar and windpower), but has been constrained by sluggish power-grid development and a continually high dependence on heavily polluting coal, hampering efforts to meet other climate targets, such as emissions reduction.
In early 2019 a government-appointed commission recommended an exit date of 2038 from coal-fired power generation. The phase-out plans envisage a 25% decline in coal generation by 2022, higher electricity prices, and substantial financial support to coal-producing areas and to power-station operators.

Investment in artificial intelligence and roll-out of 5G will be a priority
Germany scores highly on a regional and global basis for technological readiness, owing to the scope of its existing digital infrastructure; strong e-commerce and e-business penetration; above-average digital skill levels; a national Industry 4.0 initiative aimed at supporting digital manufacturing; and an effectively developed framework for research and innovation. Weaker aspects are the comparatively slow pace of high-speed broadband roll-out, modest digital adoption by SMEs and a fairly limited scope of e-government services. Total investment in R&D was 3% of GDP in 2017, one of the highest ratios in the EU. R&D intensity has trended steadily higher over the past decade, driven primarily by larger firms in the medium- and high-tech manufacturing sectors (the automotive industry is a major driver). However, Germany was no longer ranked among the "innovation leaders" in the European Commission's "Innovation Scoreboard 2018", falling back into the group of "strong innovators". Germany scored well in terms of business investment and private-public linkages, but lagged its peers in entrepreneurship and financing support. There are pockets of entrepreneurial dynamism, such as Berlin (the capital), but measures of innovative high-growth firms and start-up activity have gradually weakened in recent years. Germany has established a National Cyber Response Centre and since 2011 has updated its official cybersecurity strategy on several occasions. In 2018 the government implemented several new initiatives aimed at safeguarding its digital infra-structure, including a new agency tasked with strengthening key technologies for business operations. According to the Global Cybersecurity Index, published by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2017, Germany was ranked 24th globally in terms of its commitment and capacity to deal with the rapidly increasing threat from cyber-crime and cyber-espionage.
The government's digital policy is largely a continuation of its predecessor's "Digital Strategy 2025". The four-stage expansion plan comprised an end-2018 target for national high-speed broadband access for all households (unlikely to have been met owing to limited availability in rural and remote areas), with a second stage aiming to provide fibre-optic technology to underserved industrial areas by end-2019. A third stage envisages the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology by end-2020, and a final phase aims to have a nationwide gigabit-capable infrastructure network by 2025.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The presence of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the previous government enabled progress on some typically social democratic policy goals, including the introduction of a lower retirement age for some workers and a statutory minimum wage. The current coalition has agreed a substantial fiscal stimulus for 2019. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any large-scale structural reform efforts.
Significant structural challenges will emerge during the 2020s. The poor demo-graphic outlook is a particular problem, with the working-age population heading into decline and the population structure ageing. Social changes will also require policymakers' attention, with crucial questions including how best to integrate large numbers of refugees, and whether the need to combat terrorism should supersede Germany's long-standing aversion to surveillance.
The dominant automotive sector also faces an increasingly uncertain future following the "Dieselgate" emissions-rigging scandal and allegations of cartel behaviour, and given disruptive technological trends in the industry. The government's "Industry 4.0" initiative is intended to ensure that the dominant German manufacturing sector remains at the forefront of advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, but Germany will face strong competition from China, South Korea and Japan in the coming decades. Changes will also need to be made in the energy sector, with the government planning to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2038 in order to meet emissions goals.

Budget balance 1.8 0.8 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.3
Government debt 59.9 57.6 54.9 52.8 50.7 48.7
A balanced federal budget on the national measure-the so-called schwarze Null-has long been the main target of federal government policy, and has been met for the past five years.
The slow process of government formation after the 2017 election meant that the 2018 budget did not include significant changes, and solid revenue growth underpins our fiscal surplus estimate of 1.8% of GDP. We expect the surplus to decline to 0.8% of GDP this year. Under the 2019 budget, expenditure is set to reach an all-time high owing to an increase in defence and welfare funding; this, together with broad tax-relief efforts, means that the budget's fiscal stimulus will be the strongest since 2010.
The coalition's agreement foresees a more expansionary fiscal policy until 2021, but the deep-seated commitment across the political spectrum to the schwarze Null target will ensure that the balance remains in surplus, at an average of 0.5% of GDP in 2020-23. The downward trend in the debt/GDP ratio will persist, bringing it within the 60% EU level this year and to less than 50% by 2023.

Long-term interest rate (av) 0.4 0.3 0.6 1.1 1.5 1.7
The European Central Bank (ECB) adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below and undertaking a quantitative easing (QE) programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn. The bank ended its asset-purchase programme in December 2018, but policy conditions will remain loose in the medium term as the ECB reinvests principal payments from maturing securities and adjusts other existing tools. Economic activity in the euro zone softened in 2018, and headline growth will slow further this year. Together with a more subdued outlook for commodity prices in 2019-20, we expect this to prompt the ECB to hold off on normalising its policy stance this year. We expect a 25-basis-point increase in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020 as underlying price pressures build. Policy tightening should then proceed at a gradual pace, and we expect five more rate rises in the 2019-23 forecast period to lift the rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.

Real GDP growth averaged 2.5% in 2017, the strongest annual expansion since 2011, in line with a pick-up in world trade growth. Growth slowed to 1.5% in 2018, driven primarily by weaker car production in the second half of the year-as the industrial sector scrambled to respond to new European car-emissions tests-and by a less supportive external trade environment.
This year we forecast real GDP growth of 1%. On the one hand, this is the result of muted carry-over effects from the slowdown in the second half of 2018. On the other, it reflects our assessment of weak underlying growth: high-frequency data show that the disruption to production in the automotive sector is now fading, but global economic and political uncertainty continues to weigh on business confidence and export expectations. The composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) recorded a five-year low in December, with respondents citing global market uncertainty and reduced demand from major trading partners (particularly China). The outlook for the export sector is subdued, underpinned by the US-China trade war, the ongoing Brexit process and a projected slowdown in the world's two biggest economies-the US and China.
Nevertheless, domestic economic fundamentals remain strong. The main driver of growth in 2019 will be private consumption as the tight labour market feeds into significant nominal wage increases. Growth in state pensions and low borrowing costs will further support household spending. Investment will also continue to contribute robustly to growth, supported by an increase in public and private investment, driven by capacity constraints, skills shortages, investment in new technologies, additional residential co-nstruction and favourable financing conditions.
In 2020-23 we forecast average annual real GDP growth of 1.7%, supported by still positive domestic conditions. The competitiveness of the manufacturing sector will keep the contribution of external trade to headline growth positive, despite strong import growth. However, we expect the external environment to become more difficult and to act as the main drag on German growth. We also expect a slowdown in the US economy in 2020 to lower demand for manufactured exports in that year. Risks to our economic outlook are on the downside. An escalation of the US-China trade war could lead to greater disruption to global trade volumes. An imposition of new US tariffs on EU automotive exports is not our core forecast, but cannot yet be ruled out; nor can a disorderly UK exit from the EU. A further challenge is that Germany's flagship industry, the automotive sector, is in danger of being disrupted by technological change.
In the longer term the poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain potential growth as the working-age population declines. The inflow of young migrants in 2015-16 will mitigate the rate at which the population will age and-over the longer term-shrink, but will not change the overall trend.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Services account for about 68% of GDP, industry (including construction) for 31% and agriculture the remainder. Manufacturing accounts for about 24% of gross value added-a considerably higher proportion than in most other indus-trialised economies. Moreover, in contrast with many of Germany's peers, manu-facturing's share of gross value added has remained broadly stable over the past two decades. Nevertheless, we expect industry's share of gross value added to edge down slightly by 2023, to about 30%. A decrease in the relative importance of manufacturing is the inevitable result of rising living standards: as people get wealthier they spend a higher proportion of their income on services and a lower pro-portion on manufactured goods. However, it also reflects the changing nature of manufacturing, as even Germany's industrial champions increasingly provide value added through services supplied in conjunction with manufactured products.
Strong industrial sector faces medium-term threats from new technology
Germany's most important manufacturing sectors are automotive, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemicals, and food, drink and tobacco. Germany is the global leader in the production of premium cars, an industry that has gained from robust competition between several domestic companies, ownership structures that have enabled firms to make long-term investment, and a host of innovative supplier companies in the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Although many of the industry's main European markets experienced a weak recovery following the 2008-09 global financial crisis, sales in emerging markets such as China and India have been strong. As major producers of capital goods, German firms were able to weather the years following the global financial crisis by profiting from rapid industrialisation in emerging markets. A pick-up in world trade in 2017 underpinned strong manufacturing growth of 3.5% in Germany that year, the fastest in the past six years. The rebound was felt across the euro zone, which supported growth in capital goods production. Nevertheless, the slowdown felt across the euro zone and, to a lesser extent, in the global economy put growth of capital goods production at 1.1% in 2018 and overall manufacturing growth at 1.2%. We expect manufacturing growth to remain modest throughout the forecast period as the Chinese and US economies lose momentum.
Most industries derive competitive advantages from Germany's well-developed system of vocational training, good physical infrastructure and research base, and a tax system that encourages capital investment. German manufacturers will face a more unstable external environment, challenged by a broad shift towards protectionism across the world, but particularly led by the US. Low interest rates will continue to stimulate residential construction, ensuring relatively strong growth in overall construction activity. However, from 2023 onwards we expect larger threats to the dominance of German industry to emerge, particularly to the automotive industry. New technologies, such as electric cars and self-driving cars, could pose challenges the industry's position, especially as it is still dealing with the fallout of the diesel-emissions scandal and the move away from diesel technology, in which it had invested heavily in recent decades.
Financial services activity unlikely to shift from London to Frankfurt
The services sector is the largest component of GDP and comprises a broad range of activities, from retailing to financial services, logistics and healthcare. Services sector growth in Germany was relatively weak in the years after the global financial crisis, held back by subdued growth in household income. However, with the recent strong improvements in the labour market and the concurrent improving outlook for private consumption, services sector activity expanded relatively strongly in 2016-17 and, despite the slowdown in 2018, growth should remain firm in the coming years. One source of uncertainty is the financial services industry. In common with the rest of Europe, German financial services were hit hard by the economic downturn. Although solvency indicators have improved, many German banks remain vulnerable to the effects of any renewed shock. Furthermore, the sector has experienced relatively little reform in recent years compared with regional peers. The weakness of the banking sector has the potential to restrict growth prospects over the forecast period. A possible upside risk is that some financial services activity may move from London to Frankfurt following the UK's departure from the EU. Although some relocations have already been announced, we expect these moves to remain relatively limited, and do not expect Frankfurt to take over London's role as Europe's main financial hub.
Agriculture contributes less than 1% of GDP, one of the lowest proportions in the EU. We expect this share to remain broadly unchanged throughout the forecast period as public- and private-sector investment continues to focus on other sectors of the economy.

In 2018 consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) averaged 1.9%, with global commodity prices providing the main upward impetus. A series of recent collective bargaining agreements is starting to feed into higher wages, but underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain modest for now. Lower global oil prices this year mean that we expect inflation to soften to 1.6%. In 2020-23 we expect the German economy to outperform the euro zone average, which will keep inflation comparatively high within the bloc-albeit in line with the ECB's target of "below, but close to, 2%". We forecast an annual average rate of about 1.9% in 2020-23.

The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. After peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in early February 2018, the euro has depreciated gradually. This was a response to the formation of a Eurosceptic government in Italy, which increased political risk in the region, and to monetary tightening in the US. More recently, the euro has hovered around US$1.14:EUR1-weaker than we had anticipated-on the back of softening momentum in the euro zone. We expect it to appreciate gradually throughout 2019 as growth in the bloc picks up later this year and momentum in the US slows, but we have revised down our forecast for 2019 to an average of US$1.16:EUR1 (from US$1.19:EUR1 previously). The euro will continue to appreciate throughout our forecast period, to US$1.22:EUR1 in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is tightened gradually, and to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23, supported by the large current-account surplus.

Germany's large current-account surplus averaged 8.5% of GDP in 2015-17, underpinned by huge trade surpluses reflecting the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector. This will continue to generate large domestic savings that are mainly invested abroad, leading to a solid primary income surplus. Trade and primary income surpluses will comfortably outweigh small structural deficits on the services and secondary income accounts. We expect the current-account surplus to remain substantial, declining gradually as a share of GDP from 2017 levels, to 6.7% of GDP by 2023 owing to an increasingly disadvan-tageous global trade environment and slowly rising levels of domestic consumption and investment. These large surpluses will continue to provoke criticism-within Europe and globally-of Germany's role in prolonging demand shortfalls in much of the rest of the euro zone.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Germany
Stocks and flows
Germany is an attractive destination for foreign investment, but on balance the country is a net exporter of long-term capital. The skills of its workforce, the availability of supplier companies, the quality of the research and innovation framework, and a reliable administrative and legal environment make Germany one of the most attractive destinations in the world for inward foreign direct investment (FDI). However, relative to GDP the stock of such investment is lower than in some other comparatively sized economies. Following a significant increase in inflows during the 1990s, the rate of growth of FDI then slowed, falling below the world average. The global financial crisis then reduced inflows to about one-tenth of previous years' levels at the lowest point, in 2008. Inward foreign investment has since recovered, but outflows have continued to be larger than inflows. In the third quarter of 2018 (latest available data) the inward FDI stock was equivalent to 43% of GDP and net direct investment totalled EUR546.4bn, an all-time high.
Origin and distribution
As is the case in other developed countries, the FDI stock in Germany is increasingly dominated by service providers rather than by manufacturers, although manufacturers remain important, in line with the relatively large size of the manufacturing sector. About three-quarters of Germany's inward FDI stock originates from other EU member states-although this sometimes includes investment from outside the EU that is transferred through countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg (the largest and second-largest foreign direct investors in Germany respectively), often for tax reasons. The most important investor from outside the EU is the US, which accounts for 12% of total stock. Authorities and companies have become increasingly hesitant about increasing investment from China (by 2016 it only amounted to 1% of the FDI stock), which often targets mid-sized companies with significant technological knowhow. This is likely to weigh on investment from China in the coming years, as Germany has put its weight behind new investment screening measures at the EU level. Most outward investment is to other EU countries, but investment in Switzerland, the US, Russia and China is also significant.
Determinants
German labour costs are among the highest in the world, but have been made more competitive by a period of falling or stagnant growth in real wages over the past decade. A minimum wage was introduced in 2015, but has not had a significant effect on employment levels, reflecting at least in part the healthy state of the labour market. Regulations such as the right of worker representatives to sit on company boards (up to half of board members) have deterred some foreign investors, but in practice the system of workforce representation in companies often helps company management bodies to communicate their strategies and, where necessary, explain the need for changes in working practice-or even reduced pay in difficult circumstances. The tax environment remains, on balance, a downside. Foreign investors, including a rising number of private equity firms, are attracted by the large number of profitable medium-sized companies specialising in niche markets. Additional strengths are the country's good infrastructure, the generally high quality of the workforce, and strong research and innovation activity.
Impact
Foreign-owned companies employ about 2.5m people in Germany. Many FDI inflows take the form of acquisitions rather than greenfield investment, so that the immediate impact on employment is not clear (and in some cases has initially been negative). In industry, especially manufacturing, the dominance of German firms means that FDI has had only a limited impact. Although manufacturing made up 24% of gross value added in 2016, it represented just 16% of the inward FDI stock in that year (latest available data). Foreign investment in Germany's services sector is likely to have had a larger impact on the domestic economy, boosting productivity via the introduction of new technology and fewer hierarchical organisational structures. Investment by private equity groups has also helped to inject capital and managerial expertise into slow-growing family-owned businesses.
Potential
Germany's skilled workforce and sound infrastructure make it a good location for specialised manufacturing. More generally, the structure of German industry is still relatively fragmented, providing foreign investors with the opportunity to participate in sectoral consolidation and to reap economies of scale through acquisitions. The generational changeover at the helm of many small and medium-sized companies provides opportunities for foreign investors, although in many cases foreign involvement is not appreciated. The still moderate level of property prices-by west European standards-and increasing demand for housing, especially in urban areas, may attract investors into this sector. A poor demographic outlook, with the population expected to go into decline by 2023, will constrain Germany's potential as a consumer market. Regulatory barriers to inward investment are likely to increase in the coming years, as political pressure to protect sensitive industries has increased in recent years and broadened from traditional strategic industries, such as defence, to high-tech industries, driven by the desire not to sell technology to future competitors. This is likely to happen both at the European and the domestic levels, and will increasingly lead to delays in approving projects, and larger numbers of rejections of takeovers.

The population has experienced negative natural change ever since reunification
Germany's population declined in every year between 2002 and 2011, but high levels of net immigration underpinned population growth in subsequent years. The population reached 82.8m in 2018, up from about 80.8m in 2013, boosted in particular by the impact of the migrant crisis in 2015. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the rise in the population will moderate in the 2019-23 forecast period, with the total number stabilising at about 82.9m in 2023, before starting to decline.
The population has recorded a natural decline in every year since German reunification, with the death rate higher than the birth rate, and this will continue to be the case in 2019-23. The birth rate plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, especially in East Germany. In 1991 a total of 830,019 births were recorded in Germany, but by 2011 this number had declined to 662,685. More recently, this trend has reversed, with the fertility rate rising to 1.59 children per woman in 2016-the highest figure since 1973-reflecting both policy efforts, such as an expansion in childcare provision and parental benefits, and a higher fertility rate among immigrant communities. The fertility rate decreased marginally in 2017, to 1.57, slightly less than the EU average of 1.59, and well below the replacement rate of 2.1, the rate needed to keep the population size constant in the absence of migration.
The decline in the population in the early 2000s was caused not just by a decrease in the birth rate, but also by negative net immigration. In total, the population contracted by 1%, or about 800,000 people, between 2002 and 2012. However, this trend has now also reversed, with population growth in 2012-18 coming from positive net immigration. Population growth peaked in 2015 during the migrant crisis, when a sharp rise in inflows of migrants and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa were attracted to Germany in particular because of its strong economy and initially welcoming policy stance. However, the sheer volume of arrivals soon proved politically unsustainable, prompting a hardening of the government's position. The influx of migrants slowed in 2016-17, reflecting the closing of the Balkan route into the EU and an agreement between the EU and Turkey to halt migrants crossing illegally to the bloc from Turkey, brokered by Germany. We expect further deals to be agreed with other countries as needed, for instance in North Africa, to ensure that the experience of 2015 is not repeated.
The working-age population will continue to decline
This means that the demographic outlook will remain poor. As in the region more broadly, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline. We expect the share of the population aged 15-64 to fall from 64.8% in 2018 to 62.9% in 2023. Although these shares remain higher than those in France, the UK or Italy, the rate of decline is faster. This is likely to lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems. It will also exacerbate labour shortages, given robust economic activity at present in Germany and an increasingly tight labour market-Germany has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the EU. Efforts have already been made to attract more women and older workers into employment, but there will be diminishing returns from these over the forecast period. Policy innovation will also be needed to attract immigrants into the labour market, and in particular to integrate the recent arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa. Although the current economic upswing and a range of integration programmes are helping with this, full labour market integration is likely to be a long process.
Germany has the second-highest number of immigrants in the world, after the US, with more than 16m first- and second-generation immigrants. The largest groups in 2017 were from Turkey (which is double the size of any other group), Poland, Syria, Italy, Romania and Greece. Aside from a large inflow of migrants from the Middle East and the Balkans in 2015-16, the turnaround in net immigration since 2011 reflects a rise in the number of people migrating to Germany from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, and to a lesser extent from crisis-hit members of the euro zone, such as Italy and Greece. The economic recovery in some of these countries means that these inflows are now easing, but Brexit may result in some financial services staff moving to Germany, while other immigrations who would otherwise have gone to the UK may start to consider Germany as an alternative option.

Germany will remain the fourth-largest economy in the world in 2022
As measured by GDP at current exchange rates, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind the US, China and Japan. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, this will still be the case in 2023, with German GDP registering US$4.9trn. This is still significantly larger than the fifth-largest economy in the world on this measure, the UK, which we forecast at US$3.4trn in 2023 (about the same size as the French economy). Germany is the largest economy in Europe, and accounts for just over one-fifth of total EU GDP. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, which adjusts for differences in price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates, the German economy is the fifth largest in the world, behind India, the US, China and Japan.

Consumer demand will rise moderately over the forecast period
Germany is the largest consumer market in the EU in terms of population size. However, GDP per head is only the sixth-highest level in the EU, and the market for consumer goods is further reduced by an elevated savings rate, a cultural reluctance to buy on credit, the second-highest tax wedge as a percentage of labour costs in the OECD in 2017 (after Belgium), and a low proportion of national income accounted for by wages and salaries. Consumer spending played a relatively modest role in Germany's post-crisis recovery, with private consumption accounting for an average of only 0.1 percentage point of GDP growth in 2007-10, and 0.6 percentage points in 2011-14. However, it has become a more important driver of GDP growth more recently, in line with a strengthening of employment growth, as well as a gradual rise in wages, increases to state pensions and the introduction of a minimum wage in 2015. Collective bargaining arrangements to increase wages in specific industries are now being agreed, and will feed into real earnings growth in 2019-23 (the forecast period). This will support consumer spending; but with real personal disposable income forecast to rise by 1.1% per year in 2019-23 compared with 2% in 2014-18, demand is likely to moderate over the course of our forecast period.
The shift towards domestic-demand-driven growth in recent years is lending support to housing-related areas of the German economy, with a significant pick-up in house price growth since 2010. We expect this firmer trend in housing market activity to continue, and, combined with the rise in the number of single and two-person households, which now comprise three-quarters of the total, this will support sales of white goods. As in many countries, the profile of bricks-and-mortar retailing is changing owing to the strong growth of online shopping and consumers' increasing demand for convenience. E-commerce sales totalled EUR53.4bn in 2018, up by 10% from 2017, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE). Meanwhile, traditional mainstays such as bookshops, consumer electronics stores and household appliance chains are disappearing, and department stores are struggling to remain profitable. Reflecting the high market share of discounters, consumers will retain a strong price focus for staples, including food and clothing, but high-end income gains will also sustain demand for luxury goods.
Population ageing will influence spending patterns
Germany is a mature consumer market, but demographic trends will have an important influence on spending patterns over the next few years. The population is ageing, and, according to Germany Trade and Invest, people older than 50 years now account for more than half of purchasing power. This brings with it a rising demand for age-related services, particularly in the health sector, and for products-for example, in the tourism industry-that cater specifically for the needs of the elderly. Meanwhile, the increasing awareness in the working-age population that the public pension system will not remain as generous as it is at present will boost demand for retirement savings products in the financial services industry.

Initial conditions: Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, good infra-structure and stable institutions. Its economic underperformance prior to the 2008-09 global financial slump was largely the result of deficient con-sumer demand, but also reflected supply-side rigidities in services. The situation in the labour market and wage dynamics indicate that the rebalancing towards consumption-driven growth is set to continue during a multi-year time horizon. The structural shift towards a more services-oriented economy still has further to go in Germany than in many other OECD members, owing to the relatively high share of the manufacturing industry in overall GDP. Growth in services is likely to come from areas connected with the manufacturing sector.
Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects negative demographic trends in the coming decades, with the total population set to shrink by 0.13% per year on average in 2019-50 (the long-term forecast period), and the working-age population set to decline at an even more rapid rate of 0.57% per year. The tightening of conditions for long-term unemployment benefits has increased the incentive to search for employment, and additional measures in the same direction are likely in the long term. The partial reversal of previous plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 between 2012 and 2029 will add to demographic challenges, although we expect some relief to come from increased participation of older workers. Immigration from central and eastern Europe could make a modest contribution to alleviating labour shortages, and further liberalisation of immigration rules for highly skilled workers from non-EU countries is possible. The large-scale immigration from the Middle East and Africa seen in 2015 has provided a temporary boost for the demographic outlook, but fully integrating a significant percentage of the newcomers into productive parts of the economy is likely to be a process that spans decades.
External conditions: As an export-oriented country, Germany benefits from the broadly liberal world trade order. Generally, it suffers less than other developed countries (for example, Italy) from competition from emerging markets, such as China and India, owing to its specialisation in high-technology capital goods. This specialisation will also allow Germany to benefit from strong demand from these countries as they upgrade their capital stock. However, over the longer term German output will come under more pressure as manufacturers in emerging markets become more sophisticated and challenge German producers head on in high-end merchandise goods. Within the EU the liberalisation of trade in services should continue (albeit slowly). A worsening of the global trading environment and increased protectionism represent will have a negative impact on Germany, given its open economy.
Institutions and policy trends: Germany's low growth in the early 2000s focused the minds of politicians and policymakers on the need for economic reforms, many of which were implemented, along with more flexible bargaining about wages and other working conditions. Our expectation is that national and EU initiatives will continue to strengthen competition, but there is a risk that the recent loss of faith in market-based solutions will persist. Under the previous government there were already signs that the reforms that have underpinned strong growth in recent years were being partly reversed. Although the public finances are currently in a healthy state, further reform is needed to make them sustainable in the long term. Not much movement in this direction, for instance via the reform of the pension system, is currently in sight, and we expect policymaking to continue to be slow. This will start posing a drag on growth in the first half of our long-term forecast period.
Long-term performance: Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate is 1.4%, with a slowdown from 1.5% in the first half of the forecast period (to 2030), to 1.3% in the second half. A contraction of the working-age population is a major driver of this weakening overall growth rate. Accordingly, the picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with growth of real GDP per head averaging 1.5% throughout the forecast period, broadly in line with growth since reunification in 1990. GDP per head in 2050 will therefore register US$145,590, marginally behind Norway and the Netherlands but ahead of Denmark and Finland. GDP per head in the UK and France will remain smaller, at US$107,858 and US$116,459 respectively. In terms of the size of the German economy overall, we expect it to be overtaken by India in the 2030s, making it the fifth largest in the world by 2050. Although productivity growth in Germany will be almost as strong as in the US, the less favourable demographic outlook means that the real economy will go from 22% the size of its US counterpart in 2017 to 18% in 2050.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Germany claims to be a global leader in tackling climate change, and its Energiewende, or energy transition, focuses on expanding renewables generation. This effort has been comparatively successful, with renewables accounting for 40% of the country's power supply in 2018. However, Germany is still dependent on coal, one of the most polluting fossil fuels, which accounted for just over 38% of total power generation in 2018. Against this backdrop. the government decided in January 2019 to phase out coal by 2038 or earlier.
Germany is seeking to cut emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020, 55% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050. These ambitious targets have been made more difficult by the 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022, a low-carbon source of energy that at the time accounted for over 20% of generation. Germany's emissions have fallen over the past decade, but only incrementally, with very modest cuts in emissions in the power sector largely negated by slight increases in other sectors, such as transport and manufacturing, and in the past few years by stronger economic growth.
Efforts to mitigate climate change, including by increasing the share of renewables in the country's energy mix, will remain a government priority over the medium to long term, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects public support to be maintained-even in the face of rising electricity prices. The government aims to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix, to 65% by 2030. Germany's high technological level and self-perception as a global leader in this area will support progress in reducing emissions, and we are cautiously optimistic about the long-term outlook, even if the 2020 target is likely to be missed.
The country's exposure to the impact of climate change, meanwhile, will remain comparatively low, given its geographical position-with limited coastal areas-and temperate climate. We expect the government to remain willing and able to provide the infrastructure upgrades necessary in the face of more extreme weather patterns in the future. However, the country's heavy reliance on exports, which we expect to reach about 51% of GDP by 2023, and on imports means that supply-chain risk may increase as other countries on which it depends are affected. This year we have for the first time explicitly incorporated the impact of climate change on long-term growth in our model, and we find that the German economy will be 1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments
Technological advancements will have a significant effect on Germany over the long term for a number of reasons. First, the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher in Germany than in most other developed European countries, with industry accounting for just over 30% of the economy. According to the OECD, along with agriculture, manufacturing is the industry most exposed to automation globally. In general, the OECD found that jobs in Germany (as in central and eastern Europe, and Japan) were easier to automate than those in the UK, US, Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Second, Germany is typically strong at research and development (R&D), and innovation, which could make a transition to higher automation rates both more likely and quicker. In 2017 Germany spent 3% of GDP on R&D, among the highest levels in the bloc, but slightly behind Denmark, Sweden and Austria. In 2017 a total of 33,425 patents were filed in Germany, the fourth-highest level in the world after the US, Japan and China, according to the European Patent Office.
Third, Germany is already starting from a strong position. Of the countries looked at in the 2018 report by the International Federation of Robotics, Germany had the highest density of industrial robots in the manufacturing industry in Europe, and the third highest in the world after South Korea and Singapore. Germany's ratio of 322 industrial robots per 10,000 workers has exceeded Japan's since 2017. Excluding the automotive sector, Germany (191) is outpaced by Japan (225) and followed by Sweden (180) on this measure.
Germany is already working to increase automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies as part of its Industry 4.0 strategy, and efforts to embed new technologies across the industrial sector will continue over the long term. This is likely to be disruptive for the automotive sector in particular, as e-mobility gains pace and autonomous vehicles are further developed, and as diesel technologies are gradually phased out. It is also likely to prove difficult for the Mittelstand, the often family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises found across the country that are central to Germany's manufacturing prowess, as they may struggle to acquire the digital skills needed to compete with new challengers. Efforts to make these firms more resilient to digital disruption will gain pace in 2019-50. Although the country will not supplant the US as a leader in innovation, adoption of new technology will be consistently strong.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Since the October 2015 general election, the opposition parties have been in transition. [...]bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration, and Canada will continue to look elsewhere for support. Given the benign outlook for inflation and softer real GDP growth, we now expect that the BoC will lift rates by only 25 basis points in 2019 (we previously forecast that it would increase rates by 50 basis points this year). [...]several factors could prevent the BoC from moving altogether, including weak household spending growth, a deteriorating housing market and signs of weaker economic momentum in the US. [...]the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.9% of GDP during this period.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to remain in power after the October 2019 election, but fallout from the controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case means that the result will be tighter than previously envisaged.
The renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced trade uncertainty, although the new agreement has yet to be ratified. Trade policy will remain a risk during the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, owing to Canada's reliance on the US, its key export market.
The federal budget will remain in deficit in 2019-23, as higher receipts from the planned carbon tax, the legalisation of cannabis and other sources will be more than offset by increased spending on infrastructure and other measures.
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted the policy rate three times in 2018, to 1.75%. In 2019 we expect one more rise, of 25 basis points, although continued weak economic data could see the bank keep rates on hold. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue for the rest of the forecast period.
Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7% in 2019, from 2.2% in 2018, reflecting generally lower oil prices. Inflationary pressures will ease further in 2020, in line with a weaker economy, before picking up again from 2021 as economic growth regains some momentum.
We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from 1.8% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019 and to 1.5% in 2020 as private consumption growth moderates and an economic slowdown in the US dampens export demand. Real GDP growth will average 2% per year in 2021-23.

Country forecast overview: Canada's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government revises the Canada Business Corporations Act to introduce provisions on board gender diversity, annual election of directors, single election of directors and shareholder empowerment.
2021-23: Progress on increasing competition in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and dairy, will be uneven.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The government will continue to welcome foreign investment but will sometimes reject foreign takeovers owing to national security considerations. Chinese investment and takeover bids will come under particular scrutiny.
2021-23: Foreign investment is likely to rise in value terms as resource nationalism in the oil and gas sector eases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Canada, Mexico and the US ratify the revised North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which retains the essence of the original treaty.
2021-23: Canada continues to diversify its trade ties. Free-trade talks with China resume.
Taxes
2019-20: The government provides benefits and tax breaks to improve business competitiveness compared with the US.
2021-23: The government introduces reporting mechanisms for multinational enterprises to reduce tax avoidance.
Financing
2019-20: The Bank of Canada (the central bank) develops a system-wide framework to measure stress in banking, insurance and investment funds.
2021-23: The government completes its update of financial legislation, including the Bank Act, the Co-operative Credit Associations Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
The labour market
2019-20: Canada will enact policies to streamline processes and increase quotas to expedite the hiring of foreign talent by companies.
2021-23: The government further encourages the entry of skilled workers and professionals by raising its immigration target.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Construction of oil pipelines from Alberta progresses slowly, as the projects face opposition from environmental groups.
2021-23: After years of uncertainty, pipelines to carry energy resources from Alberta come on stream.
Technological readiness
2019-20: The technology sector benefits from workers moving from the US, especially those on that country's H1B visas, for whom the political climate becomes more difficult.
2021-23: Expertise in artificial intelligence takes root, particularly in the academic centres of Toronto and Montreal.

Background: The Canadian economy was the ninth-largest in the world in 2017 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 76% of its goods exports and is the source of about 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue, just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French-speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for sovereignty is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the main parties in contention to lead the provincial government after the 2018 election is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces, each with substantial powers, and three territories. At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate, which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party heads a majority government since winning the general election in 2015.
Policy issues: The federal government must balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with the need to maintain its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. As at 2018 the top federal income-tax rate, on taxable income above C$205,842 (US$154,200), was 33%.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$19.2bn in 2017 and the current-account deficit was US$46.4bn (2.8% of GDP).

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau, has shifted Canadian politics to the left since it won a majority at the 2015 election. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects challenges to policy initiatives and friction with provincial administrations to intensify ahead of the next federal election, due in October 2019. The unfolding controversy over alleged political interference in a criminal corruption case also risks tarnishing Mr Trudeau's political brand.
The political scandal is rooted in the surprise demotion in January of Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney-general, to the veterans' affairs portfolio. Mr Trudeau gave no reason for shifting the respected indigenous leader. However, in early February a national newspaper published unproven allegations that she had been put under pressure by the prime minister's office to abandon the criminal prosecution for fraud of SNC-Lavalin, a large Montreal-based construction and engineering firm, in favour of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). This would have let the company off with a fine, and with no ban on bidding for federal contracts. She refused to intervene and the company faces the prospect of a trial.
Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet on February 12th, a day after Mr Trudeau said that her continued presence on the front bench was proof that no one had put her under pressure. This was followed by the resignation of Mr Trudeau's principal secretary and close confidante, Gerald Butts, in a move aimed at fending off further attacks from the main opposition Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP). Mr Butts and Mr Trudeau have denied any wrongdoing. However, Ms Wilson-Raybould has since testified that Mr Trudeau had asked her in September 2018 to help to find a solution for SNC-Lavalin, because, without a DPA, he feared that many jobs would be lost in his home province of Quebec. Ms Wilson-Raybould claimed that the pressure continued until late last year despite her cautioning him against interfering politically with her role as attorney-general.
In a further setback for Mr Trudeau, a second cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, resigned on March 4th, stating that she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the affair. Mr Trudeau has rejected calls for his resignation by the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. However, the controversy is likely to result in further political fallout for the government and give added momentum to the Conservatives in the lead-up to the federal election.
Friction between the federal and provincial governments will intensify ahead of the election. The nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which is fundamentally opposed by the provincial government in British Columbia (BC), has raised questions over federal jurisdiction. The Trudeau administration also plans to impose a carbon tax in four provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that do not have pricing plans meeting federal standards. However, broad agreement on 75:25 cannabis tax revenue-sharing between provincial administrations and the federal government, which came into effect in October, together with the renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which ended a period of heightened trade uncertainty, should help to limit tensions.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Political fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair saw the Conservatives edge ahead of the Liberals in opinion polls in February, for the first time since July 2018. However, we still expect the Liberal Party to form the government after the federal election due by October 2019. This reflects its recent successes on international trade policy, the legalisation of cannabis and decrying Saudi actions towards human rights, as well as the advantages of incumbency. Since the October 2015 general election, the opposition parties have been in transition. The Conservatives have an experienced shadow cabinet and are building momentum under Mr Scheer. The party will focus on the government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely taxes and government spending. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing 40,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum. The left-leaning NDP will be boosted by the election to parliament of its leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a by-election on February 25th. However, the NDP trails well behind the two larger parties in terms of fundraising ahead of the election. The Conservatives are in the best shape in this regard.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Under the Liberals, Canadian foreign policy emphasises multilateralism over unilateralism, engagement over isolation, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. This is in clear contrast to the policies pursued by Donald Trump's administration in the US. As a result, bilateral relations with the US will be strained during the remainder of the Trump administration, and Canada will continue to look elsewhere for support. This shift was illustrated by the addition of "trade diversification" to the mandate of the international trade minister in a recent cabinet reshuffle. Nonetheless, Canada will seek to preserve relations with the US, its most important diplomatic and economic partner by far. Where possible, Canada will attempt to circumvent the White House by strengthening its ties to other levels of US government.
The successful negotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace NAFTA and preserve the trilateral arrangement, mitigates significant trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier US-Mexico deal. In particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which Canada relies on to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. The new deal grants the US greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are also managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). This concession is broadly similar to what Canada had offered during negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which the US withdrew from in 2017. In another move that should ease regional trade tension, Canada negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports. The new agreement was signed in November 2018 but is awaiting ratification by the three governments.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to key Asian markets over the forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines. With full implementation, the figure is set to rise to 99%. The government also intends to conclude a free-trade agreement with the UK after Brexit.
China was a key target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities. On March 1st the government announced that it would proceed with hearings on her extradition. Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. We expect this to persist throughout 2019, preventing progress on exploratory free-trade talks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Canada will continue supporting domestic industries that are negatively affected by US trade protectionism. In the 2018 autumn fiscal update, the finance minister, Bill Morneau, announced measures to increase the competitiveness of Canadian businesses after the introduction of tax cuts in the US at the start of 2018. These included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. Additional measures are possible in the 2019/20 federal budget, which will be tabled on March 19th. Environmental policy will also be important in the remainder of the parliamentary term. Government support for the fossil fuel industry is crucial for economic growth in the short to medium term but appears incompatible with the federal government's green credentials. The Liberal Party will continue to seek a balance between these two objectives to preserve its voter base. On the one hand, the government has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20/tonne (US$15.1/tonne) in provinces that do not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place by January 1st 2019. The federal tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. However, the consensus on taxing carbon emissions seems to be weakening as opposition mounts. On the other hand, the government is set to approve the construction of the controversial Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline, designed to enable higher volumes of crude oil from Alberta to be transported to a port in BC. Additional major investments are being undertaken to develop Canada's natural resources.
Policymakers will continue to keep a close eye on the property market, which remains a key risk owing to recent monetary policy tightening and overleveraged Canadian households. Following the imposition of macroprudential measures from the federal government to tighten mortgage-lending requirements since 2016, the market appears to be rebalancing as the quality of new mortgage lending improves. Price growth has slowed markedly, although trends vary across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but this will be counterbalanced by increased receipts due to the expected introduction of a cap-and-trade system and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018 will weigh on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit, as increased government support will be expected to shore up the economy and government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections.
In the 2018/19 budget Mr Morneau announced a series of narrower deficits over the next five years. We estimate that the fiscal deficit stood at 1.2% of GDP in 2018, and expect it to expand slightly, to 1.4%, in 2019 as the government looks to support the fossil fuels industry through rebates and additional incentives amid a softer price environment. In 2020 the government will respond to an economic slowdown with additional fiscal spending, which will push the deficit up to 1.6% of GDP; however, we expect the slowdown to be short-lived. The government will look to narrow the deficit in the longer term, and we expect it to fall gradually, to 1% of GDP by 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) lifted its policy rate by 125 basis points between July 2017 and October 2018, in response to rising inflation and tightening monetary policy in the US. However, the BoC has proceeded more cautiously than the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank), and the Canadian policy rate has remained below its US equivalent-an unusual situation. The BoC had been on course to raise its policy rate, currently 1.75%, to what it considers to be a more normal range of between 2.5% and 3.5%, but kept monetary tightening on hold at its December and January meetings, owing in part to lower energy prices, which have pushed down the headline inflation rate. However, the concern is that prolonging the period of low interest rates will encourage households to increase their borrowing, adding to near-record levels of household debt as a proportion of disposable income.
Given the benign outlook for inflation and softer real GDP growth, we now expect that the BoC will lift rates by only 25 basis points in 2019 (we previously forecast that it would increase rates by 50 basis points this year). Moreover, several factors could prevent the BoC from moving altogether, including weak household spending growth, a deteriorating housing market and signs of weaker economic momentum in the US. The BoC will keep rates on hold in 2020, when the US enters a cyclical slowdown, which, because of the two countries' interlinkages, will cause the Canadian economy to slow. Modest tightening will resume in 2021 and continue for the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth slowed to 1.8% in 2018, from 3% in 2017. This reflected weaker growth in most GDP components, notably private consumption and business investment, although export growth picked up. The pace of economic expansion slowed sharply in the final three months of last year, and this weaker starting-point has led us to revise down slightly our forecast for real GDP growth in 2019 to 1.6% (from 1.7% previously). Monetary tightening and high household debt levels will dampen private consumption growth this year, and export growth is also expected to moderate, as a result of softer economic expansion in the US, Canada's key export market.
Much of 2018 was characterised by the escalating trade dispute with the US. The renegotiation of NAFTA reduces one of the key downside risks to our forecast, although the agreement has yet to be ratified, and the steel and aluminium tariffs imposed on Canada by the US in 2018 remain in place for now. Other risks to the economic outlook include a renewed drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
Real GDP growth will slow further in 2020, to 1.5% (previously 1.6%), as the US enters a cyclical downturn. Economic expansion in Canada is expected to pick up again in 2021, and real GDP growth will average 2.1% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued government spending on infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Rising oil prices until October 2018 and the increasingly protectionist trade policy of the US added to price pressures for much of 2018, when the headline rate of consumer price inflation picked up to an average of 2.2%. The headline inflation rate fell back to 1.4% year on year in January, below the BoC's 2% target rate, owing to lower petrol prices, although core inflation was steady at 1.9%. We expect the headline inflation rate to average a benign 1.7% in 2019, reflecting a modest tightening of monetary policy by the central bank, slowing export demand and generally lower oil prices. The mild economic slowdown in 2020 will lead to a further easing in the inflation rate next year, before it picks up again from 2021 as the economy strengthens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Tightening monetary policy, a broader improvement in the global economy and the draining of the surplus in the oil market lent support to the Canadian dollar in the first half of 2018. More recently, falling oil prices have weighed on the currency. We expect the Canadian dollar to depreciate further against its US counterpart, from a full-year average of C$1.30:US$1 in 2018 to an average of C$1.36:US$1 in 2019-2020, reflecting weaker global oil prices, softer economic growth and a more dovish approach from the BoC, which we now expect will lift its policy rate by only 25 basis points in 2019, if at all. A pick-up in growth from 2021, and the resumption of monetary tightening, will underpin an appreciation in the Canadian dollar over the remainder of the forecast period, with the currency forecast to average C$1.28:US$1 in 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which we expect will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices in 2019-20 will be offset by slowing domestic demand and, therefore, import growth. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit and the shortfall on the current account will remain broadly stable as a proportion of GDP, with the latter averaging 2.9% of GDP during this period. The CPTPP, the effects of which will first be felt at the start of the next decade, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. We expect that this will help to narrow the current-account deficit to 2.5% of GDP in 2023.

Abstract: [...]of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 3.9% of GDP. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. [...]we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1.1% (mainly owing to base effects). [...]we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.7:US$1 in 2019.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Mr Erdogan and the AKP will remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23) and probably beyond.
Following the 2018 elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016 there has been a deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will continue to be tense. Points of contention include Turkey's perceived pivot towards Iran and Russia and, from Turkey's perspective, the lack of support from the US after the failed coup. A Turkish military intervention against Kurds in Syria would lead to a further deterioration in relations between the US and Turkey.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to an average of about 3.6% per year in 2019-23, reflecting the impact of the August 2018 currency crisis, higher domestic and international interest rates, a persist-ently difficult business environment and global trade tensions.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.4:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 3.9% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22 in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled an estimated US$175bn and imports about US$216bn, creating an estimated trade deficit of about US$41.6bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$27.6bn (or 3.6% of estimated GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote with a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections are planned for the end of March this year. In order to raise levels of support for the AKP ahead of the elections, the government has implemented a number of expansionary fiscal measures. We continue to expect the AKP to emerge unscathed from the local elections, retaining control of the two largest cities-Istanbul and Ankara, the capital.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign-policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups (although this may change in 2019); Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; tensions with Cyprus about the delimitation of the two countries' exclusive economic zones in the Mediterranean; and US sanctions on Turkish officials due to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October 2018).
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations, as Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU was to suspend Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to NATO forces or withdrew from NATO (none of which are our core forecast).
Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. In December 2018 the US announced that it would withdraw troops from Syria. For Turkey, the US withdrawal represents an invitation to press ahead with plans to extend its border zone within Syria eastwards. Turkey controls most of the territory across the border region from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River. The country is also planning another military operation against Kurdish forces to the east of the Euphrates, although Mr Erdogan has delayed the offensive for fear of US retaliation. With a Turkish offensive in the pipeline, the Kurds are likely to step up negotiations with the Syrian regime on a political settlement in order to avoid a situation in which they could be surrounded by enemies and without US support.
Turkey is also preoccupied with the situation in Idlib, a rebel-held city in northern Syria. An agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran in September 2018 forestalled a long-anticipated regime offensive against Idlib, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups, the most powerful of which is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The agreement centres on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, in which Turkish forces are deployed as monitors. Turkey has undertaken to integrate HTS with other opposition groups under Turkey's direct influence and to foster the creation of an autonomous local government; Russia has agreed to forestall any major offensive against the Idlib area, in which an estimated 3m people live. However, the situation on the ground remains highly precarious and could quickly embroil Turkey in yet another diplomatic struggle with its traditional western allies, which consider HTS a terror organisation, or Russia.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector.
The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically throughout the past decade will persist during our forecast period (2019-23) at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. This approach will continue to have a significant effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate), and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia has tensions. Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. There is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no support for this among EU member states. Only China appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe to foster trade, as well as connectivity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax rises in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employ-ment and social benefits caused the deficit to widen in 2018-to an estimated 1.9% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy. This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.6% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to have remained broadly stable, at an estimated 28.6% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), despite economic turmoil following the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to 25.8% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
At its meeting on March 6th the MPC kept its one-week repo lending rate unchanged, at 24%. We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that the central bank will continue to miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for December 2018 (latest available data) suggest that the economy stalled in the wake of the currency crisis. After quarterly growth of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2018, GDP contracted by 1.6% in the third quarter. We expect negative quarterly growth readings in the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, with activity starting to pick up in the second quarter of 2019. As a result, we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1.1% (mainly owing to base effects).
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 5% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.9% per year, in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts; these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices drove inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a limited depreciation of the lira (against the US dollar), a decline in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2018 will prevent inflation from declining faster than would otherwise be the case. On average, we forecast inflation of 15.5% in 2019-only marginally lower than the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 9.1% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy, with the US entering a technical recession) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of the year. This was owing to the decrease in tensions between the US and Turkey, the sharp reduction in the current-account deficit (a direct result of the currency depreciation) and the tight monetary policy stance of the central bank.
We forecast that the lira will continue to depreciate in the coming quarters against the dollar, albeit at a much more moderate pace than in 2018. A normalising domestic economic situation will support the exchange rate. However, there will be an increase in global risk aversion as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war are fully felt and the cooling of the global economy causes expectations of a recession in some advanced economies to build. Consequently, we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.7:US$1 in 2019.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable as the economy starts to grow more markedly and as global risk aversion does not increase further. A widening current-account deficit will keep downward pressures on the value of the currency. Thereafter still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although not as large as that in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.4:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP narrowed in 2018, to an estimated 3.6%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar depressed imports (owing to a deceleration in domestic demand) and boosted export competitiveness.
In 2019-23 we expect an average annual current-account deficit of 3.9% of GDP. The slightly higher deficit reflects an increase in economic growth momentum in these years. However, the deficit remains contained (by historical standards) owing to significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly. [...]that regime members deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. [...]we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devalued the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The head of the ruling regime, Nicolás Maduro, and his party, the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), are under intense political and economic pressure. Under The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast, we expect regime pragmatists to oust Mr Maduro and form a government with Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who has declared himself interim president and who is openly offering regime pragmatists a series of benefits (amnesty, international financing, a transitional government, lifting of sanctions) that Mr Maduro can no longer credibly promise. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
Following years-long economic collapse, GDP will continue to contract in 2019-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. Following our forecast transition this year, a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
The recession that began in 2014 has evolved into a hyperinflationary crisis and will continue to deepen in the short term. The economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, the worst position in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyper-inflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under huge economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to expect that a national unity government composed of opposition and regime "pragmatists" will form a transitional administration later in in 2019. The transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
On January 23rd the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president, days after Mr Maduro started a controversial new term, and was swiftly recognised by most Western nations as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Although Mr Guaidó's recent attempts at bringing humanitarian aid into the country largely failed, he has nonetheless re-energised a disillusioned population, allowing him to convoke massive demonstrations, sowing concerns among regime members of country-wide unrest at a time when dissatisfaction within the military's lower ranks is at an all-time high. More crucially, Mr Guaidó secured US sanctions on oil trade conducted by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. Prior to this the US was the destination of around 40% of Venezuelan exports, PDVSA's largest cash-paying client, and a key source of production inputs. All of this translates to a severe blow to the patronage flows underpinning the regime's internal stability.
Mr Guaidó is presenting his leadership as a path out of the current political and economic quagmire for dissatisfied regime members. He has repeatedly called for the military to depose Mr Maduro, offering the lifting of oil sanctions, the arrival of international aid and financing, and amnesty for defectors. Overall, considering that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, which Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee, we expect that pragmatists within the regime will eventually side-line or expel "hardliners" in exchange for influence in Mr Guaidó's more prosperous government.
Although a Guaidó-led transition government is our baseline forecast, questions remain. At present it is unclear how much power the opposition would have in a power-sharing transitional government. Once in place, such an administration would face considerable hurdles. If the opposition cannot deliver on its promises quickly enough, the government could well collapse. Even if short-term stability is secured, political stability will remain at risk, given the challenging tasks ahead. These include securing debt relief; rebuilding the rule of law; and attracting tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment (not only in oil but in all sectors of the economy). Through all this, the opposition would need to be careful to not upset its partners. Most of the opposition's economic rationalisation plans require reforms that eliminate the economy's distortions, closing the avenues for corruption and enrichment that regime members have used for years.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. Firstly, and foremost, that regime pragmatists have enough power to overpower hardliners who would rather rule a ruined country than share a prosperous one. Years of economic malaise and failed dialogues have been insufficient to prompt regime change in itself, and, as showcased when it blocked the entry of humanitarian aid on February 23rd, the military-a key powerbroker-remains behind Mr Maduro despite repeated rumours to the contrary. Secondly, that regime members deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a unity government is a continued lack of hard-currency to sustain the patronage system. The main risk to this assumption comes from the possibility that Russia or China, erstwhile financiers, would bail out the regime. This is not our baseline forecast, but Venezuela's oil wealth remains a draw-especially if sold off at low prices by a bankrupt regime. Another risk to our assumptions around the regime's access to hard currency centres on transnational crime and the informal export of precious metals, and whether these enterprises could be enough to make up the lost revenue from oil exports.
Given the strong risks to our baseline view, there are several alternate scenarios for Venezuela's political environment, with varying probabilities. Our main alternate scenarios are (in order of likelihood): although Mr Maduro's days seem numbered, a continuation of the PSUV's authoritarian rule could continue with more political repression, emigration, economic isolation and support from the likes of China; a complete collapse of the regime followed by a transitional government that does not include current regime members (decisive US military intervention would increase this scenario's chances); or prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict-if divisions within the regime become clearer but no faction gains outright control of the state apparatus across the country. All of these outcomes, like our baseline forecast, would be characterised by extremely high levels of political instability.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. As we currently expect such a government to coalesce within 2019, we expect elections at some point in 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled hitherto unexpected levels of support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised Mr Guaidó. A similar stance, but stressing the need for immediate elections, has been adopted by most of Europe. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. We had expected US sanctions on oil to be progressive, but instead, the hawkish US policy team instituted full sanctions directly. This introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative currently lacks international legitimacy. However, the US administration has sunk considerable political capital into Mr Guaidó and smaller-scale interventions, such as targeted bombings, have become a possibility, especially given that the US no longer has substantial economic sanctions to throw at the regime, although such action is not included in our baseline forecasts.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in actual investment. Neither country seems willing to antagonise the US too much, as they are both at sensitive points in their relations with the US. Russia is dealing with sanctions, while China is involved in difficult trade negotiations. Instead, we believe that both Russia and China will be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt at protecting their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government later in 2019 implies huge changes to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we foresee no fundamental change in policy by the Maduro regime, which remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The regime's latest plan to tackle these issues, launched in late August, was self-defeating, and the government has not curbed the monetisation of public deficits. As such, imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of any government will depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These hardliners would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. Thus, we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) and leased facilities in the Caribbean. So far, Venezuela has taken a defensive stance, treating each claim individually and stalling as much as possible before complying when seizures seem imminent. Given PDVSA's extremely strained financial situation and the lack of further sources of financing, the strategy does not seem sustainable.
In this uncertain context, Citgo is in limbo. Following the January 28th sanctions, the US government considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but it is unclear how much power Mr Guaidó will have over the company. The regime now has little incentive to defend Citgo from creditors, and it is also it is unclear if creditors could even claim it. PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure on Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 75% month on month at end-January. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyper-inflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 950,000 barrels/day (b/d) in mid-2019, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. But until US sanctions on oil are lifted, margins will be smaller, as PDVSA has lost access to its closest and better-paying market. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2023) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 142% in December. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan later in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast of a political transition later in 2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is highly likely. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devalued the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early March, following a string of devaluations in January, the official rate stood at BsS3,300:US$1 to the black-market rate of over BsS3,700:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect a current-account surplus of US$526m in 2019. The surplus is buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus to a deficit of 2.3% of GDP in 2023.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure enough finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic transition administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufacturing goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. As oil prices fall in 2019-20, adjustments to the official rate will have to be made to safeguard foreign-exchange reserves.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate (currently at 14%) from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
The multiple exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Oil prices and exports will fall in 2019-20 but so will imports. Both imports and exports will then expand in 2021-23 but a current account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score will improve slightly but its global and regional rankings will worsen as the administration struggles with the reform process and other countries make more significant improvements.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Confusion over oil sector reform creates ongoing uncertainty for investors. The government favours local companies in oil sector deals.
2021-23: Clearer policy lines help to stem the trend of lower investment in the oil and gas sectors, but mistrust between the numerous stakeholders prevents any major upturn in foreign direct investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened, but as oil prices decline, the naira weakens anyway as foreign-exchange inflows lessen.
2021-23: A premium between the official and the black-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Retroactive measures become a possibility, although the business community would fight these.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation. Efforts to increase value-added tax (VAT) and to move more of the informal economy into the formal sector mean non-oil collection also improves.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically once the 2019 elections are concluded, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts national savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and the army soon became the dominant political player. Multiparty democracy was restored in 1999. That presidential poll and the next one, in 2003, were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election and in 2019 Mr Buhari went on to win another term, with a clear lead over his main rival, Atiku Abubakar.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties dominate the political process. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the only political party to attract nationwide support, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015. Although the 36 state governments enjoy significant autonomy, almost all remain dependent on the federal government for funding.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is contentious, and currency liberalisation will be postponed whenever foreign-exchange supplies permit.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. Tax compliance is a time-consuming process.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus, although it has partly recovered since. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by an overvalued exchange rate and massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
An election on February 23rd resulted in a comfortable margin of victory for Muhammadu Buhari, who was running for a second term as president. However, the vote was tarnished by low turnout nationwide. To some extent this can be explained by a week-long, last-minute delay to the polling date, leading to a low turnout (which dropped to only 18% in one state) in the south of the country. This affirms a strong sense of apathy in that part of Nigeria and a clear disconnect from national politics.
Given that the economically-vital southern regions have a history of separatist sentiment and militancy, the disconnect between the population there and mainstream Nigerian politics bodes poorly for stability. There are added reasons to expect unrest in the south in particular. An Islamist militant group, Boko Haram, is resurgent in the north and north-east, and is utilising new tactics and more sophisticated hardware. Mr Buhari's "zero-tolerance" approach to the group was a major reason for strong turnout and support for him in the affected regions, and as was the case in his last tenure, substantial federal resources are likely to be channelled towards keeping Boko Haram at bay. However, militants in the oil-producing south cite the use of fiscal resources for far-flung causes such as combating Boko Haram-rather than for local development-as justification for launching attacks. It is a dilemma that cannot be resolved without reforming the distribution of federal hydrocarbons revenue and possibly the entire oil sector, but Mr Buhari is not an advocate of doing either. So it seems likely that attacks by aggrieved militants on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem, albeit isolated to the south.
Boko Haram will probably be aggressively countered, but in the process the north-east of Nigeria will essentially be made a low-level conflict zone. Just to the south of this region, in the Middle Belt of Nigeria, a more insoluble challenge will be addressing extremely violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for increasingly scarce water and land resources. There will also be an ethno-religious aspect to this conflict, with the majority of farmers being Christian, from a variety of small minority groups and the herders predominantly being Muslim and Fulani. Formal land titling is a potential answer, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to the violence. Moreover, in Mr Buhari's first term, it was clear that military engagements in other parts of Nigeria have priority when it comes to deploying the army's thinly spread resources, and the same is likely to be true in his second-leaving the conflict to intensify. Again, the direct security impact will be localised, with little spillover into the administrative capital, Abuja, or the economic capital, Lagos, so overall stability will not be compromised. The entire country will feel the secondary effects, however, in the form of constricted food supply and high consumer prices.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Nigeria's national elections took place on February 23rd, and were marred by violence, delays and voter apathy, but Mr Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) secured 56% of the vote. Participation across the country at 35% was well down on the 44% turnout rate in 2015, partly reflecting a delay to the poll but also disengagement with the two main candidates, both of whom represented an elite that has dominated politics for decades. Mr Buhari's sweeping victory can, nonetheless, be attributed to his clean reputation; his main rival, Atiku Abubakar of the opposition, People's Democratic Party (PDP), has in the past battled with serious (unproven) corruption allegations. Mr Buhari's triumph also hinged on particularly low turnout in the south-a traditional PDP stronghold-with voters there evidently feeling alienated by the two main candidates (who are both northern). Mr Abubakar wants to contest the result in court, but the margin of victory for Mr Buhari is too wide for there to be any credible chance of him overturning it. Although international observers reported shortcomings in the management of the election, it was not deemed to be systemically unfair. Results from the legislative election are still to be released, but early signs are for an APC majority in both houses.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian trade barriers on agricultural imports) could strain relations. Ties with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over the large numbers of Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will total only a small proportion of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Relations with South Africa will be cordial, but Africa's two largest economies will continue to compete for political, economic and cultural influence.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policy during Mr Buhari's second term is likely to carry over the interventionist policies adopted during his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be a priority and not become formal policy. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies, and Mr Buhari will not willingly attempt to dismantle consumer price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system will be off-putting to investors fearing a return of capital controls. Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but again no structural reforms (such as full or partial privatisation) will take place. Generally, Mr Buhari's approach will be to make existing entities such as the NNPC become profitable rather than relinquish state control over them entirely. This, however, leaves open questions around fiscal terms and revenue management in the oil sector. Multinationals, the NNPC's powerful union and local politicians (not to mention various militant groups) will all pull in different directions. In practice there will be few improvements in the NNPC's performance, with politicians and other members of the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to widen tax coverage and collect overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses from below-cost prices are taken by the NNPC's distribution arm) and instability in many parts of the country will also be an impediment to revenue collection. More importantly, oil production targets budgeted for by the government are repeatedly overambitious; for example in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day (b/d)-a level not seen for well over a decade, and one that will be unobtainable given underinvestment and antiquated oil infrastructure. Despite a new offshore oilfield coming onstream, total production stood at 1.6m b/d in January. Total revenue is not expected to rise above 3.4% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2023 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be a rise in populist recurrent spending on wages and public-sector benefits. Generally, flexibility on spending will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only begin to increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit equal to 2.2% of GDP over 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income, and yields on government securities are increasing as global monetary conditions tighten and foreign investors repatriate capital. A federal government default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is even weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20. Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise over 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above or around target. However, real interest rates will be too high to support private-sector activity outside of highly profitable ventures.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. Tight monetary conditions and limited private investment aggravated by cuts to public capital spending in the national budget presage a year of slow growth in 2019, while falling annual average world oil prices and a weakening naira will hold back consumer and business confidence. We forecast growth of 1.9%; this is the lowest annual rate of growth in our five-year outlook period. Growth will increase in 2020 as election-related uncertainty passes, but only moderately-as an expected slowdown in the world economy holds back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and external demand picks up, the rate of growth will quicken, although remain well below potential at an annual average of 3.3%.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and falling oil prices in 2019-20 will hold back investment in infrastructure upgrades. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will be a key driver of output growth, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by trade protectionism (which will increase), tight credit conditions (particularly affecting areas such as real estate and finance), and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will increase to 14% in 2019, as the naira enters a period of managed depreciation and pre-election giveaways (including an increase in the minimum wage) add to upward price pressures. Inflation will remain elevated at 13.5% in 2020 on the back of further currency weakening. Thereafter, as the currency stabilises, inflation will steadily ease over the rest of the forecast period to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Preventing a faster slide will be protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food. These bans are set to widen.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including petroleum imports. For this reason the set-up is not expected to be tampered with. Oil prices, and with them the level of hard-currency earnings, will in large part dictate where the authorities are able to hold the official rate and what the premium is between the official and the market rates. In 2019 lower oil prices, reduced hard-currency inflows around the election and the cumulative impact of real appreciation over recent years will cause the official rate to drop from N306.5:US$1 at end-2018 to N325.9:US$1 at end-2019. With oil prices forecast to decline again in 2020 we expect a further fall in the value of the naira, to N362.2:US$1 at end-2020. This is almost aligned with the current market-determined Nafex rate, although some spread is still expected as the Nafex rate also depreciates. As oil prices pick up on average over the rest of the forecast period and import pressures are eased by improved domestic refining capacity, we broadly expect the naira to stabilise, with an average rate of N365:US$1 in 2023.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The export profile will move in tandem with oil production trends and world crude prices. In 2019-20 our expectation for limited output gains will be outweighed by a drop in world crude prices. Only in 2021-23 when prices recover and Nigeria begins to export refined oil (a new mega-refinery being developed is expected to be export-oriented) will there be any growth in earnings, although it will be fairly sharp.
As Nigeria is a fuel importer, lower world crude prices will also ease pressure on the import bill in 2019-20. In 2019 there will be a sharp drop in imports relative to 2018, when there was a one-off surge in capital goods entering the country; weaker economic growth, cuts in public investment, lower world oil (and so petrol) prices and depreciation of the naira will also be contributing factors. In 2020 the naira will continue to depreciate, limiting consumer demand, but slightly stronger economic growth will nonetheless stabilise imports that year. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and the naira stabilises, imports will then grow with reasonable strength, albeit with less need for fuel imports as a new refinery comes on stream. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will broadly track movements in world oil prices, narrowing from 2.6% of GDP in 2019 to 1% of GDP in 2020, then widening again to 2.5% of GDP by 2023.

Full text: Greece--highlights: Political outlook
The government, led by Alexis Tsipras of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), is likely to hobble along for a few more months following the departure of the nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) in protest against the Macedonia name change deal. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Greek parliament's ratification of the deal ahead of a busy electoral cycle to increase political instability, further weakening Greece's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform. Polls point to a victory for the main opposition party, the centre-right New Democracy (ND), but forming a government may prove difficult. Domestic political instability has limited Greece's influence in the EU and the Balkans. Recent government efforts to restore influence are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions.

Greece's business environment will improve moderately in the forecast period (2019-23) with progress in almost all categories, bar political stability. Greece rises five places to 50th in the global ranking and one place in the regional ranking to 17th. Greece will remain subject to sub-optimal fiscal and other policy conditions beyond the end of the forecast period. These will constrain economic growth, and Greece's debt burden will remain onerous.

With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line. However, the government will still be subject to severe policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond, until its huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was an estimated 185% of GDP at end-2018, and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs, but it will need to re-establish itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out, which could prove challenging. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that it is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit is a possibility in the long term. We expect real growth of 2.1% in 2018 and an average of 2% in 2019-23.
Greece--highlights: Demographic outlook

Population growth   -0.3 -0.2
Working-age population growth   -0.5 -0.5
Labour force growth   -0.5 -0.2
The population will shrink by an average of 0.2% per year over the five-year forecast period, declining to 11m by 2023. Greece will experience a change in its demographic composition as a result of low fertility rates, longer life expectancy and a rising proportion of the total population aged 65 or over. Population ageing will prove a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems. The working-age population will decline at a faster pace than the population. Moderately higher participation rates (reflecting a rise in the effective retirement age, an increase in the number of women in work and immigration) will limit the decline in the labour force.

GDP per head (at market exchange rates) was an estimated US$19,467 in 2018, well below the EU average. This is forecast to rise to US$23,365 by 2023. This primarily reflects a continued projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, following the prolonged economic crisis after 2007, but also a shrinking population. This primarily reflects a continued projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, but also a shrinking population. The booming tourism (and associated real estate) sector will continue to boost market opportunities.

Growth of real GDP per head 2.1 1.3 1.6
Growth of real GDP 1.8 0.9 1.3
Labour productivity growth 1.2 2.0 1.7
We expect real GDP to grow at 1.8% per year on average in 2019-30 (2.1% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 0.9% (1.3% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 1.7% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. Scope for a further rise in labour force participation rates will be reduced, and we expect a decline in the working-age population. We expect the labour force to be fairly stable during 2019-30, but to decline dramatically in 2031-50. We believe that there is a greater than even chance that Greece will leave the euro area over the long term.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 28% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR32.4bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR54.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR5.3bn, equivalent to an estimated 2.9% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) won 35.5% of the vote in the snap September 2015 election and secured 145 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament (including the 50 bonus seats awarded to the winning party). The Independent Greeks (AE) passed the 3% threshold that secured entry to parliament and elected ten members of parliament (MPs). The two parties formed a government, with a slim majority of five seats, but the coalition collapsed in January 2019 when AE withdrew its support because of the Macedonia name change deal. The prime minister and Syriza party leader, Alexis Tsipras, now heads a minority administration, which had to rely on the help of a few members of the opposition and AE defectors to win a vote of confidence and get the Macedonia agreement through parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect the government to survive more than a few months, leading to a pre-term election before the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019.

Political outlook: Political stability
Political instability has intensified owing to the agreement with Macedonia to change that country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. This is likely to lead to a further weakening of the country's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform ahead of Greece's busy 2019 electoral cycle. Local and European Parliament elections are scheduled for May, and the general election is due by October, but we expect the general election to be called early, possibly in conjunction with the elections in May. In early January the small, right-wing nationalist AE dropped out of the coalition govern-ment in protest against the Macedonia name change deal. The government is led by the prime minister, Mr Tsipras, of Syriza. Syriza has just 145 seats in the 300-seat parliament, but, with the help of members of the opposition and AE defectors, the government survived a vote of confidence on January 16th and managed to get the Macedonia agreement through parliament. We expect the Syriza minority government to attempt to pass legislation aimed at boosting its electoral support in the coming months, but it is unlikely to survive more than a few months.
In August 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. During his period in power Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election. We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could lead to delays in the implementation of the debt-relief measures agreed with Greece's EU creditors.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Greece scores poorly in relation to other developed economies on political and institutional effectiveness, as a result of the high levels of corruption, patronage and inefficiency affecting the government and the legal system. Under the terms of its financial assistance package, which expired in August 2018, the Greek authorities committed to implementing a far-reaching reform of the public administration, judiciary and society more broadly. However, progress in many areas has fallen short of expectations, and implementation of reforms remains an issue. There is also a risk of backsliding on some reforms now that Greece has exited the economic adjustment programme.
Political effectiveness has been sorely lacking since the start of the bail-out era in 2010, as successive governments have sought to implement fiscal and structural reforms in the face of political and societal resistance. Weak governments and an inefficient bureaucracy have fallen short in fully implementing bail-out policies, despite many having been legislated.
The establishment of a modern state and public administration has been one of the four pillars of the reform agenda under the bail-out programme. The main priorities have been to control the size and cost of the public sector and at the same time increase the efficiency of the public sector in the delivery of essential public goods and services. Reforms aimed to strengthen the institutional and operational independence of major institutions, such as revenue administration and the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), as well as improve the efficiency of the judicial system and tackle corruption. The first post-programme review published by the European Commission in November 2018 noted that the size of the public sector in Greece had shrunk considerably and was broadly on par with levels in other euro area member states. However, in the second review, published in late February 2019, the Commission warned that the number of public servants increased slightly in 2018, driven mainly by a sharp increase of temporary staff. It warned that avoiding a return to pre-crisis practices of excessive levels of public-sector hiring would be a major challenge as the attrition rule of one new entry for every three exits was adjusted to 1:1 in 2019-22.
The reviews highlight that there has been uneven progress in areas such as depoliticisation of the public administration through renewal of the top management and the implementation of new selection procedures to all levels of senior management, including the replacement of political appointees. The Commission also noted mixed progress in efforts to increase the efficiency of the judicial system, which is needed to enhance the business environment and revive investment. Greece's judicial system remains burdened by an excessive backlog of cases, especially tax cases (appealing tax decisions can take up to 12 years). The sector is subject to frequent strikes by the courts and the Bar Association.
In terms of the anti-corruption agenda, the authorities have repeatedly amended the legal framework for the funding of political parties to bring it into line with European best practice.
Overall, progress in modernising the public administration and tackling ingrained patronage and corruption has been slow. We expect some further improvement in these areas during the 2019-23 forecast period, as reflected in the improved score from 4.9 to 5.5 in the political effectiveness category of the business environment rankings, but Greece will continue to lag most of its peers in the EU.
Political outlook: Election watch
Syriza trails the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in opinion polls; the gap has exceeded 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, which is likely to have increased owing to the Macedonia name change deal, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Political outlook: International relations
Domestic political instability and protracted economic and financial crises have limited Greece's influence in the EU and in the Balkans. Recent govern-ment efforts to restore influence, including the Macedonia name change deal and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. Ratification of the name change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership, but the leader of ND has said that if elected, his government would seek to renegotiate the deal.
Elections in Greece and Turkey in 2019 will fuel further tensions between the two countries. However, we believe that both sides will seek to prevent their historical enmity from escalating into military hostility. Points of contention include long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Turkey's release in August 2018 of two Greek soldiers arrested in March of that year while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.

The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece's business environment to improve moderately in the forecast period (2019-23). We expect progress in almost all categories, bar political stability. Greece's overall score improves from 5.62 in the historical period (2014-18) to 6.23, rising five places to 50th in the global ranking. It moves up one place from the bottom of the regional ranking to 17th-above Turkey, which suffered a severe currency crisis in 2018.
The Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) government no longer has a stable parliamentary majority following the withdrawal of its junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, in January 2019 and is trailing badly in opinion polls ahead of a series of elections due to be held in 2019. Syriza is hoping that the decision to exit the third bail-out programme, when it expired in August 2018, without a precautionary credit line will revive its electoral prospects. However, policy conditionality will persist well beyond the forecast period. By exiting the programme Greece has also lost access to EU financial support, and the sovereign has not as yet re-established itself fully in the debt markets.
Eight years of bail-out policies have largely failed to reverse Greece's economic decline-although a modest recovery is under way-and have instead discredited the political system and undermined social stability. There is no political or societal consensus in favour of more reforms, although paradoxic-ally there is a majority in favour of continued euro zone membership. This indicates only that fear, along with anger, have become the prevailing motifs in Greek society, which is not a sound basis for addressing the serious and deep-seated structural problems that are preventing a return to sustainable growth and competitiveness.

Business environment outlook: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make modest progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Expected improvement in macroeconomic stability subject to risks
The score for the macroeconomic environment improves, but macroeconomic stability will remain in question after Greece's exit from the third economic adjustment programme in August 2018. Unemployment remains high (18.5% in November 2018); households are highly indebted; the banking system is burdened with bad loans; the stock of public debt is the highest in the euro zone (as a share of GDP); the public sector is still inefficient, despite gradual reforms; recent competitive gains for Greek goods exports could be reversed; and labour market and demographic trends are not conducive to growth.
The government insists that it has made a "clean exit" from the bail-out programme, but policy conditionality will persist, including a significant primary budget surplus target equivalent to 3.5% of GDP annually in 2019-22, declining to 2.2% from 2023. In addition, post-programme debt relief is conditional on continued reform implementation. The government may find the post-programme transition to be more problematic than it expects, as the financial markets could turn less positive on Greek sovereign debt as time goes on as they pay more attention to Greece's political and policy risk dynamics. Greece is unlikely to be granted another debt write-down, and although the short-term repayment schedule is manageable, the size of the debt pile will weigh on investor sentiment. This might require Greece to request further financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) at some point in the medium term. Although Grexit is not a risk in the short or medium term, given the political and economic uncertainties facing Greece and the wider region, it could be a risk in the long run.

Efforts to promote competition are under way, but face headwinds
Greece has made uneven progress since its first bail-out programme in 2010 in opening up closed product markets, enhancing competition and privatising state-owned companies. Under the third Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached with the European Commission in 2015 the government committed to undertake ambitious reforms, particularly in the professions, and to revive privatisation plans. Resisted by groups that have enjoyed preferential status, these plans have only been partially implemented.
Selling off public assets was an important feature of Greece's bail-out programmes, but the privatisation process has been plagued with problems, and proceeds have been disappointing; sales brought in only EUR3.9bn in 2011-15. The third economic adjustment programme foresaw privatisation proceeds of EUR3.3bn by end-2018, rising to EUR14.2bn by end-2022. In 2016 cash receipts amounted to just one-fifth of the envisaged EUR2.5bn, but the process has picked up pace. Proceeds more than tripled to EUR1.7bn in 2017, and came close to the government's target of EUR2.7bn in 2018.
Privatisation plans have been subject to delay, but have started to pick up pace
Delays in launching the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (EESYP), the new privatisation and investment fund, are starting to be overcome. The EESYP, the profits of which will be used to pay down public debt and boost investment in the economy, finally launched a strategic plan on the develop-ment, sale or restructuring of its assets in April 2018, and the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED), now its subsidiary, continues with its disinvestment responsibilities. Implementation of the plan is likely to be drawn out, however, and the lingering transition and additional administrative delays could affect various privatisation projects.
The government's privatisation programme (which, under the enhanced surveillance by the Commission, is updated every six months on a continuous basis) has made uneven progress. The government's projections of EUR1.5bn in revenue from the sale of state assets in 2019, most of which is budgeted to occur at the end of this year (after the election deadline), are optimistic.
As at early 2019 there was still a lack of progress on the tendering of concessions to operate the Egnatia highway, owing to delays partly attributable to the Ministry of Infrastructure, but progress had been made on tendering some regional ports. There have been continued delays in the sale by Public Power Corporation of some of its lignite coal-generating assets. The sale for development of Hellinikon, the site of the former airport, had seemed to be moving forward last year, but has once again been affected by delays.
The long-delayed sale of a 66% stake in the Hellenic Gas Transmission System Operator (DESFA, which is 31% owned by TAIPED and 35% by Hellenic Petroleum, HELPE) to an international consortium comprising Snam (60%), Enagás (20%) and Fluxys (20%) was completed at the end of 2018. The conclusion of the DESFA process could unlock the process for the privatisation of the commercial division of the Public Gas Corporation (DEPA) and HELPE. The two remaining bidders for HELPE, Glencore-Carlyle and Vitol-Sonatrach, are expected to submit binding offers in early March 2019.
In March 2014 the government passed an omnibus act comprising further competitiveness-enhancing measures, resulting from a competitiveness review undertaken by the OECD. The legislation was passed, but implementation was watered down by a score of administrative measures. The third economic adjustment programme included further such measures, especially for beverages and petroleum products. Some of these were legislated at the end of 2016, but implementation is likely to continue to face resistance.
Laws put in place in 2011 and 2012 abolished restrictive practices in more than 150 professions, but they have not been fully applied. Implementation of the law has in many cases been left to professional groups, which have used their influence to maintain restrictive practices. In most liberalised professions, the growth rate has not exceeded 3%. Legislation has been passed to open network industries, but it is ponderous, and implementation will be slow.

Attracting foreign direct investment is high on government's agenda
The government's foreign direct investment (FDI) policy aims to counteract a process of disinvestment since 2010. However, FDI is hindered by complex and unevenly enforced legislation, obstructive bureaucracy and frequent changes in tax law. The third bail-out programme included policies to speed up company registration, "fast-track" investment (by facilitating approvals and relaxing regulation) and simplify export rules. Progress has been slow.
The fast track legislation covers investments that are deemed to be strategic. Priorities include industry, energy, tourism, transport, communication, health and waste management. The fast track process provides for approval in one month by the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments (DESE) and facilitation of licensing and permitting applications (against payment of fees) within two months by the Ministry of Development's Enterprise Greece agency (formerly Invest in Greece). However, the process has not gone smoothly in all cases, and as at end-February 2019 only 15 had been approved, although four more were reported to have been submitted in the first two months of 2019.
Investors will be offered more tax breaks and fewer cash subsidies
The investment incentives law (which provides for tax breaks and grants to promote regional development) involves the National Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (ETEAN), which operates in conjunction with commercial banks to provide financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, given the exceptionally high incidence of non-performing loans (NPLs) and the difficulty faced by banks in foreclosure, available funding is scant. ETEAN is supplemented by the development ministry with EU-led community support framework funding, as well as by Information Society, the government's technological consultancy arm. The result has often been confusing for SMEs, which have to invest a substantial amount of time in chasing up funding. The government had announced its intention to replace ETEAN with a national development bank, but plans have stalled.
In June 2016 the government passed Law 4399, termed the New Development Law (NDL). This sets out the complete regulatory framework on state aid for private investment plans. The reform is modelled on the EU's General Block Exemption framework, so as to ensure compliance with EU standards on the distribution of state aid. It includes some transitional provisions for investment plans submitted under previous laws.
The NDL has sector-specific priorities. Assistance packages include tax exemptions, grants, leasing subsidies, new employment cost subsidies, stabilisation of income tax rates and business risk financing via an equity fund. To have access to these incentives, businesses in eligible sectors must meet minimum investment thresholds; these depend on business size, with lower thresholds applying to smaller companies.
In April 2013 an "investor ombudsman" service was set up to examine deadlocked investments and liaise with the relevant branch(es) of the public administration to remove stumbling blocks. The ombudsman, which is part of Enterprise Greece is available for investments in excess of EUR2m. The ombudsman reported an 86% resolution rate for 2017 (latest available data), but did not report on the volume of cases. Enterprise Greece also runs a "golden visa" programme, which grants investors residence permits when investing in the country.

The Greek authorities imposed exchange and capital controls to stem a flight of cash from its banks in June 2015, at the height of a debt crisis. The restrictions contravened the rules of the common currency, but the Commission issued a special dispensation in this instance, on the grounds of maintaining the stability of the Greek financial system. The restrictions have been gradually relaxed in line with the timeline agreed in the bail-out programme, but as at end-February 2019 some remained in place, despite government promises in September 2018 that they would be removed completely in the coming months. The easing of controls that took effect on October 1st 2018 allowed unlimited cash withdrawals from credit institutions in Greece. In addition, supporting crossborder business activities, the limit on the amount of funds that can be transferred abroad was also increased, and the limit on the repatriation of capital gains and dividends was raised to 100% of the invested funds in Greece per year.
As long as Greece remains a member of the EU (and the euro area) over the forecast period, the country's foreign trade and exchange policy (with the proviso of capital controls) will be that of the EU. Trade policy will be determined by the EU's commitments to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its dispute arbitration procedures. Greece is so far largely unaffected (directly) by the latest global pick-up in tariffs.
Within the EU no tariffs or quotas are permitted, and the bloc has succeeded in abolishing most other non-tariff trade restrictions, such as health regulation that favours domestically produced goods. The EU has a customs union with Turkey, includes Norway and Iceland in the European Economic Area, and has a range of bilateral agreements enabling free trade and other economic exchange with Switzerland. Negotiations related to the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU have run into difficulty. We expect a new trade agreement between the UK and the EU to be reached before the UK's full departure from the bloc, but the risk of a "no-deal" exit has risen considerably since late 2018.
Agriculture is excluded from all of these arrangements. Outside agriculture, trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods. Average unweighted tariffs on these goods from "most-favoured nations" are 4%.

Efforts are being made to reduce tax evasion
Improvement of tax collection is a major policy focus. Some progress has been made since 2015. Government revenue declined sharply during the crisis, but it rose as a share of GDP under the bail-out programme in 2010-18 (by about 6 percentage points to an estimated 47.6% last year), despite declining incomes during most of that period. Most of the increase came from improved collection of direct and indirect taxes and social security contributions, but also higher tax rates (the 2018 budget included increases in social security contributions, tax rates for medium-sized and large properties, value-added tax (VAT) rates on most Aegean islands, and a new hotel stay levy).
However, the overhaul of the tax administration has been painfully slow and, according to the Commission's second post-programme review, further action is needed to strengthen institutional and operational capacity. The Independent Agency for Public Revenue (IAPR) only became operational on January 1st 2017 as an autonomous revenue agency, following a series of ineffective prior reforms. With significant technical support from the Commission and the IMF, the IAPR has begun to shift from building its institutional capacity to enhancing its operational capacity and efficiency, by adopting modern collection and audit tools. Tax collection rose by a solid 8.5% in 2018 to EUR5.6bn, and the use of electronic payments has become much more widespread-rising by 24% to EUR31bn in 2018. Overdue tax debts have also been reduced significantly.
Tax cuts unlikely until public debt is reduced to sustainable levels
Given the size of the public debt, the overall tax burden is unlikely to be reduced substantially during the forecast period, despite political promises of tax cuts. Greece's statutory corporate income tax (CIT) rate is one of the highest in the EU, at 28% in 2019 (down from 29% in 2018), and, in addition, companies pay a fixed annual levy of EUR650 irrespective of profitability. The system is also complex, adding to the administrative burden of compliance. The average tax burden on labour is also high, with an implicit tax rate on employed labour of 43.3% in 2017, compared with the EU average of 36.3%, according to Eurostat.
Under the enhanced surveillance regime, further reform of the tax administration will remain a priority, but curbing political influence in the tax sphere is likely to become more difficult now that Greece has exited the bail-out programme. Efforts to improve the efficiency of the justice system have had mixed results, which suggests that progress towards reducing the backlog of tax appeal cases is also likely to be slow. There are plans to set a threshold on the amounts that can be appealed in order to limit court applications, and also to increase the size of deposits that plaintiffs must make against the eventuality that the court rules against them. The Ministry of Finance is establishing debt management units in all larger tax offices, concentrating on debts past due that can be paid through the negotiation of instalment plans. All tax obligations must in future be settled through bank transfers coupled with tax identification measures; the use of cheques and cash has been abolished to prevent corruption of inspectors.

Banking sector expected to undergo consolidation
Greek banks went through a difficult time in 2010-14, and 2015 was even worse, culminating in a month-long bank holiday from June 28th and the imposition of capital controls, following accelerating capital flight in December 2014-June 2015. In 2012 rising NPLs and the 53.5% haircut on private-sector sovereign debt holdings (a 79% reduction in net present value) resulted in state-funded recapitalisation, followed by a new round of capital increases in 2014, which were privately funded. The stakes of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) in the systemic banks, as reported in its latest filing, in September 2018, were as follows: Eurobank Egrasias, 2.38%; National Bank of Greece, 40.39%; Alpha Bank, 10.96%; and Piraeus Bank, 26.42%.
In May 2018 the European Central Bank (ECB), the euro zone's banking watchdog, released the stress test results for the four "systemic" Greek banks. The testing was based on a baseline scenario that assumed annual average real GDP growth rates of 2.4% in 2018-20, and an adverse scenario that assumed a return to recession in 2018-19 and negligible growth in 2020. There are no official "pass rates", but unofficially a capitalisation rate of 5.5% or better under an adverse growth scenario is considered acceptable. All of the Greek banks met this benchmark, but they did not do so by a large margin owing mainly to the large NPL burden that continues to weigh on the Greek banking system, accounting for about 47% of total loans. High NPLs have constrained banks' ability to attract equity investors.
Domestic deposits at Greek banks remain well below pre-crisis levels after falling by 30% in 2009-12 and by another 25% in the first half of 2015. After stabalising as a result of capital controls in 2015-17, they began to increase gradually again towards the end of 2017. Bank credit to the private sector will remain constrained; it contracted in the 27 consecutive quarters to end-2017. The decline in total volume has been less than that for deposits, as many loans have been restructured to prevent default.
Greek banks will remain under pressure to reduce NPLs on banks' balance sheets, but progress will be constrained by weak bank profitability. According to the Commission's second post-programme review, the pace of NPL reduction so far has been in line with supervisory targets, but an acceleration is needed to meet the NPL targets for 2019 and future years through insolvency reforms related to the insolvency framework, the enforceability of collateral through electronic online auctions, the out-of-court debt workout mechanism and the activation of a secondary market for NPLs. The Commission warns that the process is likely to become more onerous if the proposed prudential backstop is implemented, this would force banks to hold more capital against the risk of new loans turning sour.

Labour market gradually becoming more flexible, but progress is slow
Greece's labour market has been one of the least flexible in the euro area. However, this began to change in 2010. In addition to allowing more redundancies, reforms should enable company-level collective agreements to prevail over those at the sectoral and occupational levels. Another law provided for flexible working time, including part-time shift work. Greater flexibility regarding redundancies was introduced and redundancy compen-sation was reduced. The government, under pressure from creditors to liberalise the market and after losing a precedent-setting case at the European Court of Justice, abolished in May 2017 the discretionary right of the labour minister to approve collective dismissals in the private sector. Labour market liberalisation and economic recovery, but also emigration of mainly young Greeks, has helped to reduce the unemployment rate, which was 18.5% in November 2018, down from a crisis peak of 27.9% in July 2013.
The rise of unemployment was accompanied by sharp wage cuts. In 2010-12 public-sector wages were cut three times, and in 2012 the government slashed the minimum wage for over-25-year-olds by 22% to EUR586 per month (14 annual payments) and for under 25s by 32% to EUR511. The minimum wage remained unchanged until February 1st 2019, when a single rate was restored and increased by 10.9% to EUR650 per month (still 14 annual payments). The minimum wage is expected to remain at this level until about mid-2020.
Statutory pension age increased, and likely to rise further
Primary (pillar one) pensions in the public and private sectors were reformed in 2011. In 2015 new legislation introduced penalties for early retirement in an attempt to address loopholes that let people collect pension benefits at an average age of 57-58. In May 2016 a new way of calculating pensions was introduced. It reduced auxiliary pensions, partially stopped the payment of a special social solidarity allowance for low-income pensioners (EKAS), cut high-end pensions and widower pensions, and increased insurance contributions for employers, employees and farmers. Starting in 2017, contri-butions were further increased for freelancers and civil servants. The private sector is now almost exclusively served by a single fund that came about from the merger of eight smaller ones in 2017. The statutory pension age is 67, and the number of years of contributions necessary to secure a full pension is 40. The minimum pension eligibility age is 62.
The minimum wage increase at the beginning of 2019 was long overdue. It should help to reduce poverty and income inequality, as well as supporting household demand in the near term. However, the size of the increase-a committee of experts recommended an increase in the range of 5-10%-could have potentially negative effects on economic growth and competitiveness as well as on youth unemployment, which is the highest by far in the EU at 39.1%. Because of the previously lower level, the increase in the minimum wage for workers under 25 works out at about 27%. This is only partly offset by a 6.7-percentage-point cut in employers' social security contributions for workers under 25 years of age, bringing the increase in the labour costs for workers under the age of 25 down to a still hefty 20%, potentially hindering youth employment.
From 2021 the statutory pension age and the minimum pension eligibility ages, of 67 and 62, will be revised every three years, in line with life expectancy. In the future pensions will be based on full earnings history, and accrual rates will be reduced so that the replacement ratio will drop from about 80% to 64%.
The Greek government may in the future years regret the decision (approved by the Commission) not to include previously agreed pension cuts in the draft 2019 budget, because they were deemed unnecessary to meet the government's primary budget surplus target of 3.5% of GDP this year. The cuts were designed to reduce the difference between the higher pension levels of those drawing their pensions before the 2016 reform and those drawing them after.
According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 test scores (latest available), 27.3% of Greek 15-year-olds were "low achievers", compared with 15.9% for the EU and 16.8% for the OECD. At the same time persistently high youth unemployment has led more than 400,000 young educated Greeks to seek work abroad. With a labour force of 4.7m, the negative effect on Greece's labour market is significant.

Major deficiencies in infrastructure will remain
The poor quality of Greece's transport and communications networks is holding back the country's international trade and investment potential. Delays to plans to improve infrastructure arise for a variety of reasons, including scarcity of funds, despite the availability of EU monies, administrative complexity and political opposition at local and national level. The main gaps include the need to upgrade the existing rail network, improve interconnections between domestic and international transport links, overhaul the coastal shipping network to improve the accessibility of islands and reduce over-reliance on the port of Piraeus, and promote multi-modal freight transport by improving rail connections to Trans-European Transport Network ports such as Thessaloniki. Because of a lack of investment, Greece has lagged well behind most of the rest of the EU in the move to fast broadband in terms of both the availability of higher speeds and coverage.
A motorway (Pathe) runs between Athens, the capital, and Thessaloniki, on the east coast of the mainland, and a highway-standard link (Egnatia) runs across the north from the port of Igoumenitsa to the Turkish border. However, nine uplinks from Egnatia to the Balkans remain uncompleted. The tendering of a long-term concession for Egnatia and three of its uplinks was part of Greece's commitments under the 2015 bail-out programme, but as at end-February 2019 the tender had not been completed.
The government created a special purpose vehicle (SVP) called Hellenic Motorways, where the state allocated its concession rights from five concession toll roads contracted by the government in the early 2000s. As the recent economic downturn stalled projects, the government renegotiated the concession contracts in 2013, with the Commission approving related funding of EUR2.97bn. The works were concluded in 2017.
Public funding for infrastructure projects will be scarce
The government wants to couple management concessions for infrastructure projects such as the railway system, ports and airports with development financing. In August 2016 a Chinese logistics company, Cosco, which in 2010 won a EUR5bn, 35-year concession to manage two of three piers at the main container depot at Piraeus, paid EUR280.5m to acquire a majority stake in the third pier and promised to invest a further EUR350m within the next decade. Of this, EUR294m is expected in five years, allowing Cosco to exercise a right to up its stake to two-thirds for an additional consideration of EUR88m. In March 2018 a 67% stake in the Thessaloniki port authority was sold to a consortium of international and domestic companies for EUR232m upfront plus a portion of revenue annually. The buyers also agreed to undertake investments of EUR180m over the next seven years.
In April 2017 Germany's Fraport entered a 40-year concession to manage 14 regional airports. It paid EUR1.2bn upfront and will pay both an annual flat fee of EUR23m and a portion of operating profits. It has also undertaken to invest EUR330m in the airports by 2020. In December 2018 the European competition authorities approved an agreement, valued at EUR600m, to extend the concession for Athens International Airport for 20 years (from 2026 onwards) to the current concessionaire.

Our technological readiness ranking, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Greece scores poorly and shows no improvement between the historical and forecast periods, which results in a drop of eight places to 57th in the world in the global rankings.
Our Inclusive Internet Index ranks Greece 30th out of 86 countries and second to last in the EU. The index ranks countries on four different axes: availability, readiness, affordability and relevance. Greece ranks last in the region on the first two criteria and performs well only on the last (relevance), for which it is 11th in the EU and 20th globally owing to top marks for availability of local content.
In June 2017 Greece's telecom regulator approved a two-year roll-out plan for very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) vectoring technology that will, when completed, considerably improve high-speed internet availability in Greece. However, the plan is facing delays and is being amended on a rolling basis. The government's targets are also unrealistic. For instance, by 2020 it aims to provide internet access of more than 30 Megabits per second (Mbps) to all Greeks (it was as low as 9.9% in June 2017) and a connection with a speed of more than 100 Mbps to at least 50% of households.
In the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2018, Greece ranks 57th out of 140 countries for ICT adoption and 44th for innovation capability. In the EU's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) Greece ranked 27th out of 28 in 2018, falling one place from 2017. In the UN's E-Government Survey 2018, Greece ranked 35rd out of 193 countries for e-government development-up from 43rd in 2016.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
With a general election looming in 2019, the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) government opted to exit Greece's third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line. However, the government will still be subject to severe policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond, until its huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was an estimated 185% of GDP at end-2018, and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely. Economic policy and performance will be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The implementation of further debt-relief measures agreed with Greece's EU creditors in June 2018 will be conditional on quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments, the most pressing of which include tackling Greek banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans, reviving the government's privatisation programme, removing remaining capital controls and clearing state arrears to the private sector. As these reviews will be published (the last review was on February 27th), transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
In June 2018 Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs, to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The debt-relief measures also agreed in June include a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). Greece will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2018-22. In response, Greece has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060.
In the short term Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs, but it will need to have re-established itself in the debt markets before its cash buffer runs out. After a three-year absence Greece has tapped the financial markets four times since July 2017, most recently with a new bench-mark five-year bond issuance worth EUR2.5bn in late January 2019; however, without the backstop of an official credit line borrowing from the markets is still costly relative to its official debt. The yield on the January 2019 issue was 3.6%-about 340 basis points above German government bonds of a similar maturity. Amid rising domestic political instability ahead of the next general election in Greece, as well as and growing global economic and financial uncertainty, further issuance will be challenging.
In the medium and long term, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.

After almost a decade of austerity Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP and a primary surplus of 3.9% in 2017, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 1.75%. From 2018, however, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits and primary surpluses falling well short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be more than 175% at the end of 2023.

The ECB adopted an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, bringing major policy interest rates down to zero or below and undertaking a quantitative easing (QE) programme that amounted to EUR2.6trn. The bank ended its asset-purchase programme in December 2018, but policy conditions will nevertheless remain loose in the medium term as the ECB reinvests principal payments from maturing securities and adjusts other existing tools. Economic activity in the euro zone softened in 2018, and headline growth will slow further this year. Together with a more subdued outlook for commodity prices in 2019-20, we expect this to prompt the ECB to hold off on normalising its policy stance this year. We expect a 25-basis-point increase in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020 as underlying price pressures build. Policy tightening should then proceed at a gradual pace, and we expect five more rate rises over the forecast period to lift the rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability. Risks to our outlook stem from the nomination of a new ECB president in late 2019.

Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. After real GDP growth of 1.4% in 2017, we estimate growth of 2.1% in 2018. In 2019-23 real GDP growth will remain constrained at an average of 2%. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Our estimate for 2018 real GDP growth is a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more-and higher-taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemploy-ment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 6.3% year on year in the first three quarters of 2018. Despite an expected modest quarter-on-quarter increase in the final three months of 2018, we now expect a full-year contraction of 7.5%, followed by average annual growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still about 50% below its 2007 peak. Under-investment during the crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 8.3% in 2018 and 4.5% in 2019-23.
How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine if the country remains in the euro zone. Although risks have abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Greece's economy is driven by services, particularly shipping and tourism, and the related real estate sector, as well as financial services. The industrial sector has contracted sharply and accounts for about 12% of GDP, the third-lowest level in the EU, with manufacturing focused on food-processing. Real estate accounts for about 20% of GDP, reflecting the predominance of tourism, a sector in which Greece has a huge comparative advantage. The financial sector has been through a difficult eight years, suffering from weak profitability, a huge depletion of assets, deleveraging and a major asset quality problem; NPLs were about 43% of total loans at end-2018. The sector's growth prospects will be strongly correlated with political stability and continued reform progress now that the third economic adjustment programme has ended (in August 2018).
Greece's shipping industry employs 250,000 people and makes an important contribution to the country's GDP. Demand for shipping declined dramatically from mid-2008 to early 2009, primarily owing to sharp reductions in cargoes of commodities such as iron ore and coal. After reaching a peak of 11,793 in May 2008, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI, which measures the demand for shipping capacity against the supply of dry bulk carriers) plummeted to just over 650 in December 2008, before recovering slowly from 2010 onwards. However, decelerating demand growth in major emerging markets and excess supply in the industry resulted in a slump to an all-time low of 290 points in February 2016 as a result of falling demand from the economic slowdown in China, and other emerging markets such as Brazil relying on industrial production, as well as lingering excess supply problems. In 2017, however, the BDI registered an impressive improvement, ending the year at 1,366 points, driven by Chinese demand for the import of commodities, mainly coal and iron ore. The index rose steadily in 2018 to reach 1,400 in mid-December, driven by solid growth in demand and slow growth of the fleet, but has since plummeted again to about 650, reflecting concerns about international trade tensions and slowing global economic growth.
We estimate that the pace of world trade growth slowed in 2018, to 4.4%, from 5.4% in 2017. In 2019-20 it will slow further to average 3.1% per year, before picking up to an annual average of 4% in 2021-23. This should be sufficient to underpin growth in shipping as long as shipping companies can manage oversupply problems. The health of the Chinese economy is the biggest risk to the global economy and to world trade prospects. We expect average annual real GDP growth in China of 6.6% in 2018 to slow to an average of 6.2% per year in 2019-20 and 5.3% in 2021-23.
Tourism will be main driver of growth in services
The tourism sector plays a major role in the Greek economy. It contributes about 7.5% to GDP directly and almost 20% indirectly. Employment in the sector is about 11.5% of total employment directly and 23.5% including related sectors. In terms of foreign-currency earnings based on the balance of payments, travel credits amounted to EUR16.1bn-or an estimated 8.2% of GDP-in 2018, compared with about 2% in France, 5% in Spain and 8% in Portugal. Last year was another record year for tourism in Greece, with just over 30m arrivals, compared with about 27m in 2017 and 25m in 2016.
Greece's tourism sector has been one of a few bright spots during the country's near-decade-long economic depression, and the boom shows no signs of slowing. Following strong performances in 2017 and 2018, the medium-term outlook for the sector remains strong, owing to high European demand, competitive pricing and instability in some rival tourism destinations, although the collapse of the Turkish lira in 2018 has made Turkey a much cheaper destination. These factors imply that the sector is reasonably well positioned to cope with a new tourism tax and the end of reduced value-added tax (VAT) rates for most Aegean islands, which came into force in January 2018. We expect tourism to continue to make a strong contribution to overall economic growth.

After averaging 1.1% in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate (seasonally adjusted, EU harmonised) dipped sharply at the start of 2018. After a moderate acceleration in May-October, it eased to an average of 0.8% in the final two months of the year, as oil prices plunged from about US$80/barrel in October to just under US$60/b in December. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and recent decreases in global oil prices will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect inflation to pick up only modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018-19 to 1% in 2020 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.

The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. After peaking at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in early February 2018, the euro has depreciated gradually. This was a response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, which increased political risk in the region, and to monetary tightening in the US. More recently, the euro has hovered around US$1.14:EUR1-at lower levels than we had anticipated-on the back of softening momentum in the euro zone. We expect it to appreciate gradually throughout 2019 as growth in the bloc picks up again in the second half of the year and momentum in the US slows, but we have revised down our forecast for 2019 to an average of US$1.16:EUR1 (from US$1.19:EUR1 previously). The euro will continue to appreciate throughout our forecast period-to US$1.22:EUR1 in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is tightened gradually, and to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23, supported by the large current-account surplus.

The economic crisis helped to reduce Greece's current-account deficit, which shrank primarily as a result of a compression of imports due to contracting domestic demand, but also partly of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. We expect continued deficits in 2018-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.1% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Greece
Stocks and flows
Greece is a small host of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) compared with other EU countries. Stocks and inflows are well below those of many of the central and east European countries that joined the EU in 2004. FDI outflows have in some years exceeded inflows. Most inflows have been for the acquisition of existing companies either through privatisation sales or joint ventures with local partners. There has been significant disinvestment since the advent of the crisis, particularly in the retail and banking sectors; according to data from the IMF (based on data by the Bank of Greece, the central bank), the stock of FDI fell from a peak of US$55.1bn (17.3% of GDP) in 2007 to US$25.6bn (10.8% of GDP) in 2014. The stock has since risen, to US$37.5bn (18.5% of GDP) at the end of 2017 (latest available data). This is far below the levels of new EU member states in the former communist Balkans, Bulgaria (US$47.4bn; 81.5% of GDP) and Romania (US$98.1bn; 46.3% of GDP).
Greek companies' FDI stock abroad was US$51.7bn (17.9% of GDP) at end-2011. Much of this outward investment was in the Balkan region, although Greek companies have also looked further afield, to invest in North Africa, Turkey and, in a few cases, the US. The outward stock had declined to US$24.3bn by end-2017, equivalent to 12% of GDP, as a result of retrenchment by Greek companies and banks.
With FDI inflows drying up after the onset of the economic crisis and outflows falling less sharply, net negative FDI flows were registered in 2010-11. In 2012-13 net inflows turned positive, but this was mainly the result of inflows from foreign banks recapitalising subsidiaries before divestment. Net inflows turned negative again in 2014-15, amid acute political and economic uncertainty. In 2016-18, after Greece signed a third economic adjustment programme in August 2015, there was a pick-up in FDI inflows and positive net investment to an estimated US$4.4bn and US$3.8bn respectively last year-the third consecutive year of positive net investment.
Origin and distribution
Historically, the US was a major source of FDI for Greece in heavy industries such as refining and chemicals. However, since Greece entered the common market, EU countries, particularly Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg (because of its status as a financial hub for special-purpose entities (SPEs) created by multinationals for inward and outward FDI) have become the main investors, primarily in financial services and telecommunications, as these sectors have been liberalised. Retrenchment in Europe has led to a search for funding from Middle Eastern sovereign funds (Dubai and Qatar) and pursuit of investment from China, particularly through the China Development Bank. A number of Chinese transport and logistics companies have made large investments in Greece with a view to creating a gateway into the EU for Chinese manufactures.
Determinants
Factors that have traditionally held back greater levels of inward direct investment include Greece's geographical remoteness from core EU markets; its small domestic market; excessive product and market regulation; underdeveloped transport and communications infrastructure; a reluctance to allow companies in so-called strategic sectors to be majority foreign-owned; widespread red tape and corruption; and an unstable tax regime. Political factors have sometimes come into play, such as Greece's historically tense relations with Turkey.
Impact
The share of FDI inflows in gross fixed investment in Greece is well below the EU average. Increased foreign participation in privatised or part-privatised companies would boost productivity. In April 2016 Greece sold a majority stake in Piraeus Port Authority, the state-owned company that controls Pier I and the port's cruise, passenger and car terminal operations, to China's Cosco. The sale opens the way for the site to become a major multimodal transhipment hub in the Mediterranean and the most important sea trade gateway into Europe, potentially bringing significant benefits to the economy.
Potential
Greece holds relatively few attractions for FDI in the short term for investors, with the exception of investors specialising in distressed assets. The payoff from structural reforms in terms of increased competitiveness will take years to materialise fully and could yet be reversed in the medium term now that Greece has exited its EU-backed economic adjustment programme. In the medium term the country will offer opportunities for investment in renewable energy and greenfield new technology ventures if red tape continues to be reduced and the reduction in labour costs is maintained. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects average annual FDI inflows of about US$3bn in 2019-23.

Age structure set to change dramatically over long term
According to UN projections, the population will decline slowly in the coming five years, by an average of 0.2% per year in 2019-23. However, life expectancy is increasing, and in 2018 it was estimated to average 81.2 years-broadly in line with the EU28 average of 80.9 (2017). The population structure by age bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with a decline in the working-age population and a rise in the elderly population (65 years and older). The proportion of people aged over 65 has been increasing steadily, from 19.2% in 2013 to an estimated 20.6% in 2018, and is forecast to rise to 22.3% in 2023.
The economic impact of an ageing population will be exacerbated to some degree by the continued decline in the working-age population during the forecast period (2019-23), which means that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged above 65 to the working-age population) will rise compared with the previous five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population of people of working age will decrease by an average of 0.5% per year during 2019-23. The labour force will also decline by 0.2% over the forecast period as a result of young, skilled workers leaving Greece to seek employment opportunities elsewhere and the arrival of fewer economic migrants; this contraction of the labour force is set to happen despite moderately increased participation rates due to a rise in the effective retirement age and an increase in the number of women in work. The labour force participation rate for women is much lower than that for men and one of the lowest in the EU. The gender gap (the difference between the employment rates of men and women of working age (20-64) in Greece was 19.7 percentage points in 2017 (Eurostat), compared with an EU28 average of 11.5 percentage points. The narrowest gap (1 percentage point) was in Lithuania and the widest in Malta (24.1 percentage points). According to the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), in November 2018 the unemployment rate for males was 14.3%, compared with 23.7% for females. We expect to see a gradual increase in the employment rate for women over the medium and long term.
According to Eurostat, the foreign population of Greece as at January 1st 2018 was 816,100-equivalent to 7.6% of the total population. Of these, 2% of the total population were EU-born and 5.6% were born outside the EU. In June 2015 parliament approved a controversial law granting Greek citizenship to second-generation immigrants. The law is estimated to have affected up to 200,000 people, including those who arrived in the early 1990s as part of the mass exodus from eastern Europe after the fall of communism in 1989. Prior to the new law, children born to migrants to Greece received a "maternity clinic certificate", not a birth certificate, leaving them without proper legal status. As they were not Greek nationals, they were not entitled to the same rights-such as travelling, working and studying within the EU-as EU citizens.
The migrant influx via Turkey and Greece into Europe in 2015-16 posed big challenges for the authorities. About 800,000 migrants arrived in Greece in 2015, according to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Of these, about 60% were of Syrian origin, 24% came from Afghanistan and 8% were from Iraq. The closure of the western Balkan migrant route in February 2016 led to about 55,000 migrants becoming trapped in Greece. In March 2016 the Turkey-EU joint action plan stemmed the influx into Greece of migrants arriving from Turkey. However, Greece is vulnerable to another migration upsurge given its extensive and porous land and sea border.
Immigration has become contentious issue
In 2009 a Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) government passed legislation regarding permanent residence and working rights, in keeping with EU regulations. The law provides complex rules designed to allow non-EU persons legally resident in the country for five years to acquire permanent resident status. Since 2006 all immigration has been linked to employment criteria. A special committee determines available jobs, and these are posted at consulates abroad. Persons wishing to take employment in Greece have to acquire a work permit through the consulate in their home country before arriving. Persons arriving in the country on student or tourist permits are not allowed to change their status and take employment. Those seeking to establish themselves in Greece as self-employed or as entrepreneurs have to fulfil detailed criteria demonstrating their relevant experience and supply evidence of having sufficient funds to support themselves so that they do not become dependent on the state.

Greece is a small, fragmented market of about 11m people, about 12% of whom live on its many islands. As a result, distribution is a problem, which is exacerbated when the population is swollen by large numbers of tourists in the high season. Restrictions will continue to affect the movement of commercial visitors to and from non-EU countries, particularly as Greece is a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which places tough controls on external borders. Greece has been in the front line of recent mass migration into Europe-mainly from the Middle East and North Africa-that accelerated in 2015. Road and rail development should gradually improve access between Greece and its Balkan neighbours in the coming years, enhancing the country's role as a distribution centre for the southern Balkans, as will development of the ports of Thessaloniki, Kavala and Alexandroupolis.
Market opportunities to pick up but consumer spending power constrained
Over the forecast period (2019-23) market opportunities in Greece will be constrained by consumers' limited spending power. Further budget spending constraints, driven by the need to attain large primary surplus targets, still high unemployment, high taxes, only a partial recovery in wage levels and tight credit conditions will make consumers cautious about spending over the forecast period. GDP per head (at market exchange rates) was an estimated US$19,467 in 2018-well below the EU average. This is forecast to rise to US$23,365 by 2023. This primarily reflects a continued projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, following the prolonged economic crisis after 2007, but also a shrinking population. The booming tourism (and associated real estate) sector, which attracted a record 30m tourists in 2018, (almost triple the population of Greece itself), will continue to boost market opportunities, despite the disappointing projected growth performance of the wider Greek economy.
The after-effects of the depression in 2008-13, the truncated recovery in 2014 and the renewed economic downturn in 2015-16 have reshaped market opportunities considerably. A previous rapid increase in one-person households will decelerate sharply, as the number of single people able to afford their own household will not continue to rise. This will have negative follow-through effects on demand in various consumer goods markets, such as white goods, consumer electronics and furniture. Other consumer durables that relied on a buoyant, debt-fuelled economy for sales growth are also likely to suffer, as low consumer confidence will mean that households will show restraint with regard to big-ticket purchases in the forecast period. Internal migration to the cities will continue, but at a slower rate than previously, as young people abandon farming because of falling EU subsidies and the hope of better employment opportunities in the big cities: Athens (the capital), Thessaloniki and Larissa.

Demand for healthcare and communication services will rise
Food, beverages and tobacco, together with housing, household fuel, and household goods and services, absorbed about 45.8% of consumer expenditure in 2018 and will account for about the same in 2023. Demand for housing and household goods and services will fall slightly as a percentage of GDP compared with other items over the forecast period, in line with the broadly stagnant number of households over the next five years. Non-essential spending will generally also be held back by increased saving efforts by the population, as well as debt-reduction moves. Greater spending power among the immigrant community and population ageing will have important influences on consumption patterns during the forecast period, providing support to demand for communication and healthcare services.

The negative effect of ageing will become more pronounced over time
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that real GDP growth will reach an annual average of 1.3% in 2019-50. We expect annual growth to average 1.8% in 2019-30, slowing to 0.9% in 2031-50. This trajectory reflects the greater negative effect of demographic trends in 2031-50 compared with 2019-30, especially the contraction in the working-age population, which becomes more significant as time goes on. Reasonable total factor productivity and capital stock growth will support a continued economic expansion in 2019-50, offsetting the negative contribution of labour to GDP growth from 2030.
Initial conditions: Several factors will hold back potential long-term GDP growth in Greece. The economy has a number of deep structural flaws that will continue to hinder growth in 2019-30 and 2031-50. In particular, a decline of just under 65% in real fixed investment in 2008-18 will undermine the economy's ability to generate growth over the longer term. Agricultural products, renewable energy, tourism and shipping will remain the principal exports in the long term, but the success of these and other industries will depend on the restoration of competitiveness to the economy inside the euro zone (we are sceptical that a return to competitiveness and catch-up growth can be accomplished as long as Greece retains the euro, hence our forecast that "Grexit" is more likely than not over the long term). A marked deterioration in the demographic profile will result in diminishing opportunities to increase labour utilisation.
Demographic trends: The demographic profile becomes increasingly unfavourable in 2019-50. The working-age population will decline steadily throughout the same period, despite increased immigration. Life expectancy is high, reflecting good living conditions and health standards (at least until recently). The birth rate is set to remain below the replacement level; since 2012 the crude death rate has exceeded the crude birth rate every year. The number of people aged 65 and over will increase from 2.3m now to 2.7m by 2030 and 3.5m by 2050. The number of people of working age will decline from 7.3m to 6.8m and 5.2m over the same periods.
Transport links to neighbours should improve
External conditions: Greece is geographically remote from the EU market, although less so since the EU's expansion to include Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Greece will continue with infrastructure projects to improve transport links with the southern Balkan states of Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria (in part subsidised by the EU). Provided that the Balkan region can improve political and economic stability, better transport links with the countries to the north is expected to help to attract some investment from foreign companies wishing to establish a base in south-east Europe from a more established Western market. We believe that there is a greater than even chance that Greece will leave the euro area over the long term as currency devaluation becomes the preferred method to restore competitiveness. However, even if Greece were to leave the euro area, it would remain a member of the EU.
Greek and EU relations with Turkey will also influence Greece's long-term economic prospects. Relations between Greece and Turkey had been improving since mid-1999, but took a turn for the worse in 2016-18 over the Cyprus question and Greece's failure to extradite alleged coup plotters to Turkey. Relations are set to remain volatile and we do not expect progress in the dispute over Cyprus. The EU opened membership negotiations with Turkey in October 2005. Some large EU member states, such as Germany and France, stalled the talks on technical grounds. Following a deal over migration between the EU and Turkey in April 2016, the stalled negotiation process is meant to get under way once again. Our forecast is that Turkey will not join the EU as it is currently shaped. Even so, we expect trade and investment relations between Greece and Turkey to remain broadly positive.
Political stability will be imperilled by public distrust of all political parties
Institutions and policy trends: Greece has a well-established parliamentary democracy. However, political stability will be undermined by weak govern-ment and the continued erosion of public trust in the mainstream political parties and in Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which has proved to be a disappointment for many of those who propelled it to power in 2015. A renewed migration surge into Europe along the Balkan route as a result of war and state breakdown in the Middle East could potentially threaten social stability. Institutional effectiveness should improve moderately in 2019-50, but progress will be constrained by pervasive corruption and bureaucratic resistance to change.
Structural reforms to boost competitiveness will be inconsistent and will make a difference only over the longer term. We expect that red tape will be reduced moderately and that the tax system will become more efficient. Labour law has been changed to ease the hiring and firing of workers and to give priority to labour agreements at the company level. In the longer term high public debt and the cost of supporting an ageing population will leave little room for a cut in the overall burden of taxes and social security contributions.
Long-term performance: We expect real GDP to grow at 1.8% per year on average in 2019-30 (2.1% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 0.9% (1.3% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 1.7% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. Scope for a further rise in labour force participation rates will be reduced, and we expect a decline in the working-age population. We expect the labour force to be fairly stable during 2019-30, expanding by 0.06%, but to decline dramatically in 2031-50, by 0.99%, or 0.60% on average in 2019-50.

Climate change and sustainability
Climate change is predicted to have significant negative effects on the natural ecosystems of Greece and on many important economic sectors over the long term; for example, it will affect biodiversity, species and habitat, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, transport, activities in coastal areas and the built environment in urban centres, mainly owing to increased temperature, drought, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. According to specific climate change studies pertaining to Greece, the effects will lead to reductions in productivity, capital losses and additional costs arising from damage repair. According to the Bank of Greece (the central bank), under an inaction ("business as usual") scenario, Greek GDP could fall by an annual 2% by 2050 and 6% by 2100. It states that the total cumulative cost to the Greek economy could reach about EUR700bn (at constant prices of 2008) by 2100. According to our long-term economic model by 2050, climate change will subtract 3.45% from forecast real GDP.
There is thus a clear necessity for the adoption of mitigation and adaptation policies. For example, the tourism and shipping sectors are of vital importance for Greece. The focus is on "Blue Growth", which is a long-term strategy to support integrated sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors. The Mediterranean region, where Greece is situated, is bordered by more than 20 countries and a large part of the Mediterranean Sea remains outside national jurisdiction. As a result, co-operation on issues such as climate change and the environment is vital in order to manage maritime activities, tackle climate impacts, protect the marine environment and fight pollution in the Mediterranean Sea region.
Greece adopted its first National Climate Change Programme in 1995; the second was adopted in 2002 and revised in 2007. All three iterations placed great emphasis on achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by changing the fuel mix to include a higher percentage of natural gas and renewable energy sources; improving energy efficiency and conservation in all sectors; making structural changes in agriculture and transport; reducing emissions in waste management; and expanding research and development efforts. In 2016 Greece adopted the National Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change (ESPKA) through Law 4414/2016. According to the strategy, mitigation policies and adaptation should be adopted in all fields, but especially in those of energy, clean technology, industry, biodiversity, agriculture, tourism and transport. The Ministry of Environment and Energy is responsible for identifying potential climate change impacts, planning and co-ordinating adaptation measures and policies, and preparing a national adaptation strategy
Demographic and productivity headwinds
The UN's long-term population projections for Greece, which The Economist Intelligence Unit uses in its long-term growth forecasts, assume a decline in the overall population from an estimated 11.14m in 2018 to 10.78m in 2030 and 9.98m in 2050. Falling fertility rates and continued outward emigration will result in a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. Greece's working-age population is projected to fall from an estimated 7.28m in 2018 to 6.79m in 2030 and to 5.23m in 2050; that is a decline of 28.8% over the 2019-50 period. This is one of the steepest declines in the euro area. We forecast a slightly slower decline in the labour force, of 17.4%, from 4.72m in 2018 to 3.90m in 2050; this assumes an increase in the labour participation rate in the coming decades as the retirement age is raised and more women enter the labour force.
Such adverse demographic projections would imply a severely negative effect on long-term real GDP growth rates. This is especially worrying given Greece's poor historical track record when it comes to productivity growth. To achieve even the modest average annual long-term real GDP growth rate of 1.3% that we forecast for 2019-50 will require significant improvements in employment, labour participation and productivity growth rates, such that Greece has not achieved in recent decades. Over the past 45 years Greece's total factor productivity growth averaged 0.2% per year, and since joining the euro zone in 2001 it has turned negative.
A rebound in investment is likely given the low levels to which it has sunk over the past decade, but this positive effect will not persist over decades. Once the capital stock is replenished, the boost to growth will dissipate and the negative effects of poor demographics and productivity will reassert themselves. The emphasis must therefore be on policies to raise employment rates and boost total factor productivity to avert the disaster of negative average growth rates over the long term. However, the empirical evidence suggests that even the most comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at transforming productivity and the labour market may not deliver the sort of pay-off in terms of growth that is needed.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Country Forecast Turkey February 2019 Updater

Abstract: [...]of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 3.9% of GDP. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. [...]we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1.1% (mainly owing to base effects). [...]we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.66:US$1 in 2019.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and probably beyond.
Following the June 2018 elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will continue to be tense. Points of contention include Turkey's perceived pivot towards Iran and Russia and, from Turkey's perspective, the lack of support from the US after the failed coup. A Turkish military intervention against Kurds in Syria would lead to a further deterioration in relations between the US and Turkey.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to an average of about 3.6% per year in 2019-23, reflecting the impact of the recent currency crisis, higher interest rates, a difficult business environment and trade tensions.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.3:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in 2018 (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of about 3.9% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2018 goods exports totalled an estimated US$175bn and imports about US$216bn, creating an estimated trade deficit of about US$41.3bn and a current-account deficit in the region of US$28bn (or 3.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote with a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections are planned for the end of March this year. In order to raise levels of support for the AKP ahead of the elections, the government has implemented a number of expansionary fiscal measures. We continue to expect the AKP to emerge unscathed from the local elections, retaining control of the two largest cities-Istanbul and the capital, Ankara.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign-policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups (although this may change in 2019); Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; tensions with Cyprus about the delimitation of the two countries' exclusive economic zones in the Mediterranean; and US sanctions on Turkish officials due to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October).
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations, as Turkey, and the EU, have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU was to suspend Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to NATO forces or withdrew from NATO (none of which are our core forecast).
Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. In December 2018 the US announced that it would withdraw troops from Syria. For Turkey, the US withdrawal represents an invitation to press ahead with plans to extend its border zone within Syria eastwards. Turkey controls most of the territory across the border region from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River. The country is also planning another military operation against Kurdish forces to the east of the Euphrates, although Mr Erdogan has delayed the offensive for fear of US retaliation. With a Turkish offensive in the pipeline, the Kurds are likely to step up negotiations with the Syrian regime on a political settlement in order to avoid a situation in which they could be surrounded by enemies and without US support.
Turkey is also preoccupied with the situation in Idlib, a rebel-held city in northern Syria. An agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran in September 2018 forestalled a long-anticipated regime offensive against Idlib, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups, the most powerful of which is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The agreement centres around the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, in which Turkish forces are deployed as monitors. HTS has refused to endorse the agreement, but has stopped short of violating it. Turkey is seeking to persuade core factions of HTS to integrate with the other rebel groups and to reaffirm their rejection of the global jihadi mission of al-Qaida. If integration occurs, a significant block of Turkish-allied rebel groups could potentially be involved in the negotiations for a political settlement. The success of Turkey's machinations in Idlib is far from guaranteed, and it remains unlikely that HTS will give up its long-standing cause and join Turkish forces.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector.
The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically throughout the past decade will persist during our forecast period (2019-23), at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. This approach will continue to have a significant effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate), and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia has tensions with. Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. There is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. Only China, therefore, appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe to foster trade, as well as connectivity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite several tax rises in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits caused the deficit to widen in 2018-to an estimated 1.9% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy. This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from a forecast 2.3% in 2019 to 1.6% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to have remained broadly stable, at 28.6% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017), despite economic turmoil following the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to 25.8% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that it will miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for October-December 2018 (latest available data) suggest that the economy stalled in the wake of the currency crisis. After quarterly growth of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2018, GDP contracted in the third quarter, by 1.6%. We expect negative quarterly growth readings in the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, with activity starting to pick up in the second quarter of 2019. As a result, we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1.1% (mainly owing to base effects).
In 2020 we expect growth to rebound to 5% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 3.9% per year, in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts; these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to 16.3% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a limited depreciation of the lira (against the US dollar), a decline in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. Accommodative fiscal policies in response to the economic weakness in the final months of 2018 will prevent inflation from declining faster than otherwise. On average, we forecast inflation of 15.5% in 2019-only marginally lower than the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 9.1% as global oil prices continue to decline (owing to a slowdown in the global economy, with the US entering a technical recession) and the exchange rate depreciates slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an annual average of about 7.2%-still more than the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% on average against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar for the remainder of the year. This was owing to the decrease in tensions between the US and Turkey, the sharp reduction in the current-account deficit (a direct result of the currency depreciation) and the tight monetary policy stance of the central bank.
In the first weeks of 2019 the lira exchange rate has remained at about TL5.30:US$1. We forecast that the lira will continue to depreciate in the coming quarters against the dollar, albeit at a much more moderate pace than in 2018. A normalising economic and financial domestic situation will support the exchange rate. However, there will be an increase in global risk aversion as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war are fully felt and the cooling of the global economy causes expectations of a recession in some advanced economies to build. Consequently, we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.66:US$1 in 2019.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable as the economy starts to grow more markedly and as global risk aversion does not increase further. A widening current-account deficit will keep downward pressures on the value of the currency. Thereafter, in 2021-23 still elevated inflation and a significant current-account deficit (although not as large as that in 2017) will result in a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.3:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP narrowed in 2018, to an estimated 3.6%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar depressed imports (owing to a deceleration in domestic demand) and boosted export competitiveness.
In 2019-23 we expect an average annual current-account deficit of 3.9% of GDP. The slightly higher deficit reflects an increase in economic growth momentum in these years. However, it remains contained (by historical standards) owing to significant gains in competitiveness from the 2018 currency crisis that will boost exports and limit import growth throughout the medium term.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly. [...]that regime members deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. [...]we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devaluated the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The head of the ruling regime, Nicolás Maduro, and his party, the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), are under intense political and economic pressure. Under The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast, we expect regime pragmatists to oust Mr Maduro and form a government with Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who has declared himself interim president and who is openly offering regime pragmatists a series of benefits (amnesty, international financing, a transitional government, lifting of sanctions) that Mr Maduro can no longer credibly promise. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
Following years-long economic collapse, GDP will continue to contract in 2019-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. Following our forecast transition this year, a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
The recession that began in 2014 has evolved into a hyperinflationary crisis and will continue to deepen in the short term. The economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, the worst position in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and side-lining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under huge economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to expect that a national unity government composed of opposition and regime "pragmatists" will form a transitional administration in 2019. The transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period (2019-23) to be characterised by political instability.
On January 23rd the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president, days after Mr Maduro started a controversial new term, and was swiftly recognised by many nations as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Mr Guaidó's move has re-energised a disillusioned population, allowing him to convoke massive demonstrations, sowing concerns among regime members of country-wide unrest at a time when dissatisfaction within the military's lower ranks is at an all-time high. More crucially, Mr Guaidó secured US sanctions on oil trade conducted by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The US previously imported some 500,000 barrels/day (b/d), around half of all Venezuelan exports, and was PDVSA's largest cash-paying client. In addition, it was a key source of diluents required to process Venezuela's extra-heavy crude. We expect that PDVSA will be able to re-direct part of its production and find new sources of diluents, limiting the overall drop in output. However, the exports will have lower profit margins, meaning a severe blow to the patronage flows underpinning the regime's internal stability.
Mr Guaidó is presenting his leadership as a path to a relatively easy way out of the current political and economic quagmire for dissatisfied regime members. He has repeatedly called for the military to depose Mr Maduro, offering the lifting of oil sanctions, the arrival of international aid and financing, and amnesty for defectors. Overall, considering that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, which Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee, we expect that pragmatists within the regime will eventually side-line or expel hardliners in exchange for influence in Mr Guaidó's more prosperous government.
Although a Guaidó-led transition government is our baseline forecast, questions remain. At present it is unclear how much power the opposition would have in a power-sharing transitional government. Once in place, such an administration would face considerable hurdles. If the opposition cannot deliver on its promises quickly enough, the government could well collapse. Even if short-term stability is secured, political stability will remain at risk, given the challenging tasks ahead. These include securing debt relief; rebuilding the rule of law; and attracting tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment (not only in oil but in all sectors of the economy). Through all this, the opposition would need to be careful to not upset its partners. Most of the opposition's economic rationalisation plans require reforms that eliminate the economy's distortions, closing the avenues for corruption and enrichment that regime members have used for years.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. Firstly, and foremost, that regime pragmatists have enough power to overpower hardliners who would rather rule a ruined country than share a prosperous one. Years of economic malaise and failed dialogues have been insufficient to prompt regime change in itself, and the military-a key powerbroker-remains behind Mr Maduro despite repeated rumours to the contrary. Secondly, that regime members deem Mr Guaidó's amnesty and transitional government offers credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and fear of being prosecuted outside of Venezuela (a credible fear given accusations of drug- and weapon trafficking levied at regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast for a unity government is a continued lack of hard-currency to sustain the patronage system. The main risk to this assumption comes from the possibility that Russia or China, erstwhile financiers, would bail out the regime. This is not our baseline forecast, but Venezuela's oil wealth remains a draw-especially if sold off at low prices by a bankrupt regime. Another risk to our assumptions around the regime's access to hard currency centres on transnational crime and the informal export of precious metals, and whether these enterprises could be enough to make up the lost revenue from oil exports.
Given the strong risks to our baseline view, there are several alternate scenarios for Venezuela's political environment, with varying probabilities. Our main alternate scenarios are (in order of likelihood): although Mr Maduro's days seem numbered, a continuation of the PSUV's authoritarian rule could continue with more political repression, emigration, economic isolation and support from the likes of China; a complete collapse of the regime followed by a transitional government that does not include current regime members (decisive US military intervention would increase this scenario's chances); or prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict-if divisions within the regime become clearer but no faction gains outright control of the state apparatus across the country. All of these outcomes, like our baseline forecast, would be characterised by extremely high levels of political instability.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities and for elections within 12 months of the transitional government's formation. As we currently expect such a government to coalesce within 2019, we expect elections at some point in 2020. International assistance in organising the elections would be necessary and forthcoming.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled hitherto unexpected levels of support from the international community. Most governments in the Americas, under the banner of the Lima Group, have recognised Mr Guaidó. A similar stance, but stressing the need for immediate elections, has been adopted by most of Europe. The US is Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, instituting crippling oil sanctions and openly calling for the military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. We had expected US sanctions on oil to be progressive, but instead, the hawkish US policy team instituted full sanctions directly. This introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action but smaller-scale interventions, such as targeted bombings, have become a possibility, especially given that the US no longer has substantial economic sanctions to throw at the regime, although such action is not included in our baseline forecasts.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but with little apparent success in actual investment. Neither country seems willing to antagonise the US too much, as they are both at sensitive points in their relations with the US. Russia is dealing with sanctions, while China is involved in difficult trade negotiations. Instead, we believe both Russia and China will be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt at protecting their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government in 2019 implies huge changes to economic policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to help restore confidence in rule of law and promote investment. But until then we foresee no fundamental change in policy by the Maduro regime, which remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The regime's latest plan to tackle these issues, launched in late August, was self-defeating, and the PSUV government has not complied with the cornerstone promise of abolishing the monetisation of public deficits. As such, imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under the transition and successor governments. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of any government will depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These hardliners would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. Thus, we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in government. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) and leased facilities in the Caribbean. So far, Venezuela has taken a defensive stance, treating each claim individually and stalling as much as possible before complying when seizures seem imminent. Given PDVSA's extremely strained financial situation and the lack of further sources of financing, the strategy does not seem sustainable.
In this uncertain context, Citgo is in limbo. Following the January 28th sanctions, the US government considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, but it is unclear how much power Mr Guaidó will have over the company. The regime now has little incentive to defend Citgo from creditors, and it is also it is unclear if creditors could even claim it. PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure on Citgo, its Caribbean facilities and even shipments will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 75% month on month at end-January. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by international assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 950,000 b/d in mid-2019, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. But until US sanctions on oil are lifted, margins will be smaller, as PDVSA has lost access to its closest and better-paying market. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in 2020 but will end the forecast period (2023) well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 142% in December. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation. However, supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of 2018, the government has repeatedly devaluated the currency and promised liberalisation of exchange controls. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early February, following a string of devaluations, the official rate stood at BsS3200:US$1, roughly in line with the black market rate.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect a current-account surplus of US$600m in 2019. The surplus is buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus to a deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2023.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure enough finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic transition administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government, led by Alexis Tsipras of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), is likely to hobble along for just a few more months following the departure of the nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) from the coalition regarding the Macedonia name change deal, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political instability to increase ahead of a busy electoral cycle in 2019, further weakening Greece's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform.
We forecast that an early election will be held before the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019, possibly in conjunction with the European Parliament and the local elections in May. We expect the centre-right New Democracy (ND) to win the most seats and to form a government. However, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality in the medium term, until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's international creditors. Mr Tsipras's promises to lower taxes and reverse spending cuts could cause tensions with the EU and investors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece will not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
We expect that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.4% in 2017 to a moderate 2% per year on average in 2018-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 175% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove to be difficult.
Inflation is forecast to rise only slightly, from 0.8% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2019 and 1% in 2020, reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and lower global energy prices. In 2021-23 we expect oil prices to rise again, pushing up inflation to 1.5% per year. We expect still moderate current-account deficits in 2018-23.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our forecast period (2019-23), from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected to be in the macroeconomic environment, as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's medium- and long-term financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) are slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR28bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR47.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR3.2bn, equivalent to 1.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Political instability has intensified owing to the agreement with Macedonia to change that country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which the Greek parliament ratified on January 25th. This is likely to lead to a further weakening of the country's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform ahead of Greece's busy 2019 electoral cycle. Local and European Parliament elections are scheduled for May, and the general election is due by October, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the general election to be called early, possibly in conjunction with the elections in May. In early January the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE) dropped out of the coalition government in protest against the Macedonia name change deal. The government is led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of the Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza). Syriza has just 145 seats in the 300-seat parliament, but, with the help of members of the opposition and AE defectors, the government survived a vote of confidence on January 16th and managed get the Macedonia agreement through parliament. We expect the Syriza minority government to attempt to pass legislation aimed at boosting its electoral support in the coming months, but it is unlikely to survive more than a few months.
In August 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. During his period in power Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election, although Syriza may receive a boost in popularity, as the European Commission has accepted the government's plan to cancel agreed pension cuts in 2019 on the grounds that the cuts will not be needed to achieve the country's fiscal targets (a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018-22). We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could lead to delays in the implementation of the debt-relief measures agreed with Greece's EU creditors.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in opinion polls; the gap has exceeded 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, which is likely to have increased owing to the Macedonia name change deal, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability and protracted economic and financial crises have limited Greece's influence in the EU and the Balkans region. Recent government efforts to restore influence, including the Macedonia name change deal and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty, as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. Ratification of the name change agreement aims to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and its application for EU membership, but the leader of ND has said that if elected his government would seek to renegotiate the deal.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have been threatening to boil over, increasing the risk of military hostility, particularly in the Aegean Sea. However, we believe that both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in August of two Greek soldiers arrested in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Despite exiting the third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line, the government will still be subject to huge policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond. General government debt is huge, at an estimated 184% of GDP in 2018, and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely.
In June 2018 Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs, to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
In June EU creditors also agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for EUR130.9bn worth of loans), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2018-22.
In response, Greece has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The implementation of the debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after its exit from the bail-out programme in August, it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term. In the medium and long term, however, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, as will other negative factors such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, Grexit will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP and a primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.9% in 2017, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 1.75%. From 2018 we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits and primary surpluses falling well short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve, owing to the fact that debt repayments will become much more onerous from that year on.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be more than 180% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB has been pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that concluded at the end of 2018 with about EUR2.6trn of government and corporate bonds added to the bank's balance sheet. Economic activity has softened, but higher commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the main refinancing rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. After real GDP growth of 1.4% in 2017, we estimate growth of 2.1% in 2018. In 2019-23 real GDP growth will remain constrained at an average of 2%. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Our estimate for 2018 real GDP growth is a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more-and higher-taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets (of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023), continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 6.3% year on year in the first three quarters of 2018. Despite an expected modest quarter-on-quarter increase in the final three months of 2018, we now expect a full-year contraction of 7.5%, followed by average annual growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still about 50% below its 2007 peak. Underinvestment during the crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 8.2% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019-23.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine if the country remains in the euro zone. Although risks have abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exit from the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
After averaging 1.1% in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate (seasonally adjusted, EU harmonised) dipped sharply at the start of 2018. After a moderate acceleration in May-October, it eased to an average of 0.8% in the final two months of the year, as oil prices plunged from about US$80/barrel in October to just under US$60/b in December. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and recent decreases in global oil prices will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect that inflation will pick up only modestly, from an average of 0.8% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2019, 1% in 2020 and 1.5% per year in 2021-23 as domestic demand growth accelerates.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. It peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy. We expect the euro to remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US, but forecast a moderate strengthening against the US dollar from the second half of 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2019 and then US$1.22:EUR1 in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is gradually tightened. The euro will also receive structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the economic crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit widened from 0.8% of GDP in 2015 to an average of 1.7% of GDP per year in 2016-17, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We expect continued deficits in 2018-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, and as global energy prices rise moderately in the second half of the forecast period. However, these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Manoeuvring ahead of the presidential and legislative elections in 2019 will create tensions and distract from efforts to contain security threats and the implementation of much-needed economic reform.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
The 2019 elections will be a close contest between the ruling All Progressives Congress and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). We expect that the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will win, but that the next administration will face the same divisions as the current one.
Policy reform in the oil sector will become central to economic policy, and some meaningful attempts to privatise the upstream industry will be made. Progress will be slow, however, because of the scale of the endeavour and resistance from powerful interest groups.
Although not expected to be fully floated, the official naira exchange rate will be allowed to depreciate in 2019-20 as oil prices drop and the central bank becomes less interventionist.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers.
The current account will record surpluses throughout the forecast period, with some output gains in the oil sector and supportive world oil prices. The difficult business environment will restrict the development of non-oil exports.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party presses for deregulation, but the legislature is unlikely to be amenable.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Confusion over oil sector reform creates ongoing uncertainty for investors. The government favours local companies in oil sector deals.
2021-23: Clearer policy lines help to stem the trend of lower investment in the oil and gas sectors, but mistrust between the numerous stakeholders prevents any major upturn in foreign direct investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Political upheaval around the 2019 elections delays reforms that would make trading across borders easier.
2021-23: A premium between the official and the black-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Retroactive measures become a possibility, although the business community would fight these.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation. Efforts to increase value-added tax (VAT) and to move more of the informal economy into the formal sector see non-oil collection also improve.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically once the 2019 elections are concluded, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts national savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and the army soon became the dominant political player. Multiparty democracy was restored in 1999. That presidential poll and the next one, in 2003, were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election-the first time an incumbent had been defeated at the ballot box and an important step forward for the country's democracy.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties dominate the political process. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the only political party to attract nationwide support, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015. Although the 36 state governments enjoy significant autonomy, almost all remain dependent on the federal government for funding.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is contentious, and currency liberalisation will be postponed whenever foreign-exchange supplies permit.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. Tax compliance is a time-consuming process.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus, although a positive trade balance has since resumed. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Nigeria is heading into a hotly contested general election on February 16th against a concerning backdrop. The chief justice, Walter Onnoghen, has been suspended without constitutional procedure being followed and will now be unable to adjudicate on any electoral disputes that arise from the vote. As the presidential race is going to be extremely tight and the opposition are convinced it will be rigged, this presents a real problem, especially if the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, wins. The opposition see the timing of Mr Onnoghen's suspension as wholly political, alleging that Mr Buhari wanted to install a sympathiser in his place. So if an electoral dispute did occur and the new chief justice, Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed, ruled in favour of the incumbent, the opposition now have grounds for discrediting such a decision. Mass protests and even a political crisis could follow. Presaging how stark the risks to stability could be, a militant group in the country's south (where Mr Onnoghen comes from) have already warned that they will step up attacks on critical infrastructure in protest. Another alarming sign has come from government accusations that the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), is fomenting unrest in the country's north by actively supporting Boko Haram, an Islamist terrorist organisation. Unsubstantiated claims like these will only work to build tensions before the poll.
The baseline forecast of The Economist Intelligence Unit is that the main opposition candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will win the presidency outright, thereby obviating instability that could follow an electoral dispute. Nonetheless, a different electoral outcome now contains a severe downside risk to political stability, which will anyway be under severe strain. Even assuming that the election passes peacefully, the new government will be faced with the same insoluble security problems as the outgoing administration. A concerted effort is needed to eliminate Boko Haram in the north-east and bring an end to clashes between settled farmers and pastoralists in central Nigeria. Militancy in the oil-producing Niger Delta is another ever-present threat. Nigeria's overstretched military will be unable to decisively end violence in these regions, with meagre federal government resources being stretched too thin. It will also prove hard to create economic opportunities for local populations; poverty, rising unemploy-ment and competition for natural resources are at the root of much of the instability. Parliamentary rifts will be another hold-up to finding a permanent solution. Both of Nigeria's main parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP, lack any clear ideology, and most legislators prioritise their constituents' needs over party. As different regions have competing interests and vastly different priorities, the collective resolve needed to bring permanent peace to unstable parts of Nigeria will be lacking.
Speculation over the threat of a military coup or a civil war is likely to surface periodically but the military has been depoliticised since the junta stepped aside in 1999. Meanwhile, there is little appetite beyond extremist agitators for a return to civil war, given memories of how disastrous the 1967-70 conflict was for the country. Nonetheless, as the country's leadership struggles to shift Nigeria onto a more sustainable path to economic development, the risks to stability will intensify as more and more Nigerians question what they have to lose from pushing for violent change.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Presidential and legislative elections are due in February 2019. Mr Buhari is the APC's presidential candidate, and his main challenger is Mr Abubakar from the PDP. Both candidates are from northern Nigeria, where Mr Buhari's support base lies, presaging a fierce contest there. With the vote likely to be split in the north, Mr Abubakar will find it easier to garner support from the country's south, which has traditionally been a PDP stronghold. This gives Mr Abubakar an edge, as does popular frustration over a sharp rise in joblessness and poverty (two of the biggest concerns of voters) on Mr Buhari's watch. Growing instability in north-eastern and central Nigeria also denies the incumbent much in the way of achievements to boast of while in office; he was given a clear mandate in 2015 to restore law and order. Nonetheless, strong incumbency advantages in Nigeria imply that it will be a very tight race. If Mr Abubakar loses-a distinct downside risk to our forecast-there may be a rejection of the result by the PDP, which is convinced the election will be rigged.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian trade barriers on agricultural imports) could strain relations. Ties with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over the large numbers of Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will total only a small proportion of the headline-grabbing pledges made given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges will tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Relations with South Africa will remain strained. Africa's two largest economies will continue to compete for political, economic and cultural influence.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Over the forecast period efforts to open up the economy will be made but progress will be haphazard. Mr Abubakar advocates a pro-business and free-market reform agenda, with his flagship proposal being to privatise the state oil company, the National Nigerian Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which dominates both the upstream and downstream oil sectors. The loss of a federal government stake in the oil sector-from which it derives most of its revenue-would then be compensated-for by higher taxes. It is not yet clear whether the divestment would be wholesale, or if the NNPC's various subsidiaries would be sold separately. The latter is a more likely policy; getting private investors interested in buying and recapitalising Nigeria's oil refineries would require the deregulation of pump prices-which are fixed below cost-recovery-as would ending the NNPC's role as a petroleum distributor. Not only would ending petrol subsidies unleash inflation, but it could lead to widespread riots; for many Nigerians cheap petrol is the only visible contribution that the federal government makes to daily life. Having established reform of the NNPC as the linchpin of his campaign, we expect Mr Abubakar to make some determined moves to privatise the corporation, although in practice these will be limited to its upstream operations. However, completion of that task is unlikely within the outlook period. The NNPC has a daunting trade union and its opaque setup has long been a vehicle for patronage, meaning the legislation needed to overhaul the sector will contend with powerful vested interests and be extremely slow to pass.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to widen tax coverage and collect overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses from below-cost prices are taken by the NNPC's distribution arm) and instability in many parts of the country will also be an impediment to revenue collection. More importantly, oil production targets budgeted for by the government are repeatedly over-ambitious; for example in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day-a level not seen for well over a decade, and one that will be unobtainable given underinvestment and antiquated oil infrastructure. Total revenue is not expected to rise above 3.4% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2023 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be a rise in populist recurrent spending on wages and public-sector benefits. Generally, flexibility on spending will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only begin to increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit equal to 1.9% of GDP over 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income, and yields on government securities are increasing as global monetary conditions tighten and foreign investors repatriate capital. A federal government default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is even weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on bolstering economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, we expect interest rates not to move much in 2019-20. Rates will then fall in 2021 and stabilise over 2022-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation hovers above or around target. However, real interest rates will be too high to support private-sector activity outside of highly profitable ventures.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019 what are expected to be fiercely contested elections in February, as well as falling oil prices, will hold back business and consumer confidence. High local borrowing costs will likewise hold back investment, and with cuts to public capital spending as well we forecast a growth rate of 1.9%; this is the lowest annual rate of growth in our five-year outlook period. Growth will increase in 2020 as election-related uncertainty passes, but only moderately-as an expected slowdown in the world economy holds back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and external demand picks up, the rate of growth will quicken to an annual average of 3.3%. This is well below potential, with numerous factors holding the economy back.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and falling oil prices in 2019-20 will hold back investment in infrastructure upgrades. Hydrocarbons production is therefore not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash, although a new, private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost in the latter years of the forecast period. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by trade protectionism, tight credit conditions (particularly affecting areas such as real estate and finance), and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will increase to 14% in 2019, as the naira enters a period of managed depreciation and pre-election giveaways (including an increase in the minimum wage) add to upward price pressures. Inflation will remain elevated at 13.5% in 2020 on the back of further currency weakening. Thereafter, as the currency stabilises, inflation will steadily ease over the rest of the forecast period to an average of 8.8% in 2023. Preventing a faster slide will be protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food. If Mr Abubakar goes ahead with proposals to fully float the naira and liberalise pump prices, inflation would exceed these forecasts by a considerable margin. (Nigeria is heavily dependent on imports, and consumer prices are highly sensitive to currency movements.)
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters (with various other rates in between). Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including petroleum imports. For this reason the setup is not expected to be tampered with. Oil prices, and with them the level of hard-currency earnings, will in large part dictate where the authorities are able to hold the official rate and what the premium is between the official and the market rates. In 2019 lower oil prices, reduced hard-currency inflows around the election and the cumulative impact of real appreciation over recent years will cause the official rate to drop from an estimated average of N305.6:US$1 in 2018 to N319:US$1. With oil prices forecast to decline again in 2020 we expect a further fall in the value of the naira, to an average of N362.4:US$1. This is almost aligned with the current market-determined (Nafex) rate, although some spread is still expected as the Nafex rate also depreciates. As oil prices pick up on average over the rest of the forecast period and import pressures are eased by improved domestic refining capacity, we expect the naira to stabilise, with an average rate of N365:US$1 in 2023.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The export profile will move in tandem with oil production trends and world crude prices. In 2019-20 our expectation for limited output gains will be outweighed by a drop in world crude prices. Only in 2021-23 when prices recover and Nigeria begins to export refined oil will there be any growth in earnings, which will be fairly sharp.
As Nigeria is a fuel importer, lower world crude prices will also ease pressure on the import bill in 2019-20. In 2019 there will be a sharp drop in imports relative to 2018, when there was a one-off surge in capital goods entering the country. Weaker economic growth, lower world oil (and so petrol) prices and depreciation of the naira will also be contributing factors. In 2020 the naira will continue to depreciate, limiting consumer demand, but slightly stronger economic growth will nonetheless stabilise imports that year. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and the naira stabilises, imports will then grow with reasonable strength, albeit with less need for fuel imports as a new refinery comes on stream. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation for the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will broadly track movements in world oil prices, narrowing from 4% of GDP in 2019 to 2.2% of GDP in 2020, then widening again to 3.6% of GDP by 2022 before retreating again to 3.1% of GDP in 2023.

Country Forecast Venezuela January 2019 Updater

https://www.proquest.com/reports/country-forecast-venezuela-january-2019-updater/docview/2169135787/se-2?accountid=14357

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. [...]we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. [...]we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%, but exchange controls remain.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, have put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed administration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
Following years-long economic collapse, GDP will continue to contract in 2019-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. Following our forecast transition this year, a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will continue to depress private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, the worst position in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of roll-back of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The VAT rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Despite an extremely severe economic crisis, the government headed by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), retains its hold on power. Regardless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the worsening economic conditions to trigger a chaotic political situation, with a "mixed administration" with nominal opposition participation the most likely outcome. We expect this to happen in 2019, but the process is highly uncertain. We expect the forecast period to be characterised by political instability
The opposition, owing to a history of infighting and ineffectiveness, is incapable of channelling the populace's dissatisfaction with the government. Opposition parties, which consider Mr Maduro illegitimate, are currently split on whether to negotiate with the government or rebuff dialogue in the hopes of forcing an internal fracture in the regime. In any case, the regime's years-long campaign of harassment and disfranchisement has made opposition parties powerless in practice and vulnerable to retaliation.
Regardless, economic crisis and civilian unrest have made the government dependent on the military to remain in power. The integrity of the civic-military alliance running the country is sustained via opportunities for corruption (afforded by large state-owned companies, foreign-exchange controls and subsidised imports) and the tacit approval of transnational organised crime (as evidenced by indictments abroad of regime leaders). Regime factions are primarily based on personal and patronage ties, resulting in a variety of civic-military factions coexisting within the regime. Outside of potential outright criminal income, the resources maintaining this patronage network come from export revenue generated by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company.
However, this patronage network has suffered significantly as mismanagement and underinvestment at PDVSA have taken their toll on oil revenue and output. (Production is currently at around 1.2m barrels/day-b/d-down from 2.5m b/d when Mr Maduro took office.) With the current administration patently unable to demonstrate the technical competence or the foreign financing needed to turn PDVSA around, we judge the status quo unsustainable. We currently expect an internal fracture of the regime in 2019 but, regardless of the timing, what happens next is hard to predict.
Given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would take priority under a new government. We expect regime pragmatists to seek assistance from Western governments and multilateral organisations. To gain international legitimacy and secure financing, these pragmatists would allow nominal opposition participation in a mixed administration. Given past behaviour, there should be plenty of opposition figures willing to participate. This administration would nonetheless face pockets of resistance in places such as the judiciary, the Constituent Assembly (the country's de facto legislature), and the radicalised supporters of the PSUV known as colectivos. Political stability through the forecast period will be limited.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. A crucial assumption is that, given economic conditions, Mr Maduro cannot sustain regime cohesion indefinitely. Risks to this assumption include the possibility of new disputes with the opposition that bolster internal regime unity, along with the regular purges within the regime's ranks that help to maintain Mr Maduro's grip on power. A second assumption is that Russia and China-erstwhile financiers-will not provide substantial funding to the current administration (or to a PSUV-only successor administration). We base this view on the regime's inability to repay already expired loans and the fact that it has received limited Chinese or Russian aid since 2015. The main risk here is that Venezuela's oil wealth, however, remains a draw-especially if sold off at low prices by a bankrupt regime. A significant third assumption underpinning our forecast is the need to restore macroeconomic stability and steady resource flows through the patronage system, which has become so urgent as to allow pragmatists to accept Western-demanded democratic and macroeconomic reforms. Here again, there are risks to our assumptions: democratic reform would be likely to involve judicial retribution on a number of current regime leaders, while macroeconomic reform would eliminate the economy's distortions, closing avenues for corruption and enrichment.
As such, there are strong risks to our baseline view, and there is a strong possibility of alternate scenarios. These include: a PSUV-only administration securing enough Chinese financing; a permanently impoverished nation led by an outright military government (or one with civilian figureheads); or-as an outside possibility-prolonged chaos, if regime cohesion fails but no faction gains clear control of the state apparatus across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. The past two elections (presidential in May and municipal in December) saw most of the opposition proscribed and only some parties are participating (a source of infighting). Based on our political assumptions, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing would almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Most regional governments, under the banner of the Lima Group, have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. They publicly consider Mr Maduro to be illegitimate since he won his term in irregular elections in May. They agree on this with Venezuela's opposition but-perhaps wary of destabilising the nation-have no concrete plan of action on how to dislodge the head of the regime. The US has put individual sanctions on most regime leaders, including potential successors to Mr Maduro. This limits the field of negotiating partners in the event of an internal fracture of the regime, but sanctions are reversible. US country-level sanctions block Venezuela from refinancing its debts, compounding the regime's financial woes. Despite the hawkish US foreign policy personnel, sanctions on the oil trade (the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market and a key source of production inputs) and military intervention are not part of our baseline assumptions.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. The regime openly courts the two countries, but with little apparent success in actual investment.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The government remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Its latest economic plan, launched in late August, was self-defeating, and the government has not complied with the cornerstone promise of abolishing the monetisation of public deficits. As such, imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed.
Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that underpins our baseline forecast for political change. Furthermore, outside of promising a hard-to-implement reduction in fuel subsidies, the plan had little focus on PDVSA's falling output; production at PDVSA remains a crucial factor in supporting the economy amid a collapse in the non-oil sector.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under a new government. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new regime, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These members would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. Thus, we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in leadership. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) and leased facilities in the Caribbean. Both facilitate PDVSA's capacity to export oil and import production inputs. So far, Venezuela has taken a defensive stance, treating each claim individually and stalling as much as possible before complying when seizures seem imminent. Given PDVSA's strained financial situation and the lack of further sources of financing, the strategy does not seem sustainable.
Citgo, itself indebted and posted as collateral for loans and bonds, could have its fate be resolved by a prolonged judicial process in the US. We believe that, if forced to choose, the government would prioritise its Caribbean assets over Citgo, as the former are key for PDVSA's capacity to export, while import-export trade with Citgo could be re-routed to other US companies. However, it is unclear when the government may have to choose or if would have the capacity to do so. PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 111% month on month at end-December. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 1m b/d in mid-2019, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in the second half of 2020 but will remain well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017, even at the end of our forecast period.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 144% (702,521% year on year) in November. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%, but exchange controls remain. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early January the black-market exchange rate was around BsS981:US$1; the official rate stood at BsS700:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We expect a current-account surplus of US$2.7bn in 2019. The surplus is buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus from 3.7% of GDP in 2020 to a deficit of 1.8% by 2023.
We currently expect that the new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: [...]of the recent sharp depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.5% of GDP. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. [...]we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1% (mainly owing to base effects). [...]we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.6:US$1 in 2019.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and probably beyond.
Following the June 2018 elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will remain tense. Points of contention include Turkey's perceived pivot towards Iran and Russia and, from Turkey's perspective, the lack of support from the US after the failed coup. A Turkish military intervention against Kurds in Syria would lead to a further deterioration in relations between the US and Turkey.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign-policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to an average of 3.6% per year in 2019-23, reflecting the impact of the recent currency crisis, higher interest rates, a difficult business environment and trade tensions.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.2:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the recent sharp depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.5% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

a Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current-account deficit of US$47.4bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and probably beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th 2018, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the govern-ment nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the nationalist-minded MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in June 2018 (they had originally been scheduled for late 2019). Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote with a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections are planned for the end of March this year. In order to raise levels of support for the AKP ahead of the elections, the government has implemented a number of expansionary fiscal measures. We continue to expect the AKP to emerge unscathed from the local elections, retaining control of the two largest cities-Istanbul and the capital, Ankara.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign-policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups (although this may change in 2019); Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; tensions with Cyprus over the delimitation of the two countries' exclusive economic zones in the Mediterranean; and US sanctions on Turkish officials due to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorism charges (sanctions were lifted after Mr Brunson was released in October).
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations, as Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU were to suspend Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to NATO forces or withdrew from NATO (none of which are our core forecast).
Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. In December 2018 the US announced that it would withdraw troops from Syria. For Turkey, the US withdrawal represents an invitation to press ahead with plans to extend its border zone within Syria eastwards. Turkey controls most of the territory across the border region from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River. The country is also planning another military operation against Kurdish forces to the east of the Euphrates, although Mr Erdogan has delayed the offensive for fear of US retaliation. With a Turkish offensive in the pipeline, the Kurds are likely to step up negotiations with the Syrian regime on a political settlement in order to avoid a situation where they could be surrounded by enemies and without US support.
Turkey is also preoccupied with the situation in Idlib, a rebel-held city in northern Syria. An agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran in September 2018 forestalled a long-anticipated regime offensive against Idlib, which is controlled by Islamist rebel groups, the most powerful of which is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The agreement centres around the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib in which Turkish forces are deployed as monitors. HTS has refused to endorse the agreement, but has stopped short of violating it. Turkey is seeking to persuade core factions of HTS to integrate with the other rebel groups and to reaffirm their rejection of the global jihadi mission of al-Qaida. If integration takes place, a significant block of Turkish-allied rebel groups could potentially be involved in the negotiations for a political settlement. The success of Turkey's machinations in Idlib is far from guaranteed, and it remains unlikely that HTS will give up its long-standing cause and join Turkish forces.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign-policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector and its dynamic and diversified private sector.
In the aftermath of the failed coup in July 2016 a highly accommodative policy stance has exacerbated fiscal and external imbalances. This, together with heightened political uncertainty, the tightening of global liquidity conditions and tensions with the US, led to a currency crisis in August 2018. The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically over the past decade will persist over our forecast period (2019-23), at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. This approach will continue to have a significant effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate), and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options would remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia is at odds. In addition, Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in October 2018. Furthermore, any potential IMF programme would include a level of foreign involvement that the government would be likely to view as unacceptable, and that would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. There is also little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. Only China, therefore, appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe to foster trade and connectivity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
Despite a series of tax rises in 2018 and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits will have caused the deficit to widen in 2018, to an estimated 1.9% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-23 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy. This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, from 2.2% in 2019 to 1.5% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to have remained broadly stable, at 28% of GDP at end-2018 (from 28.3% at end-2017), despite economic turmoil following the August currency crisis and various government handouts ahead of the June 2018 elections. The ratio will decline slightly, to 25.3% by end-2023 as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
In September 2018 the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision was a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of 2019. From mid-2019 to 2020 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that it will miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth has exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August 2018. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for October-November 2018 (latest available data) suggest that the economy stalled in the wake of the currency crisis. After quarterly growth of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2018, GDP contracted in the third quarter, by 1.6%. We expect negative quarterly growth readings in the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, with activity starting to pick up in the second quarter of 2019. As a result, we believe that growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1% (mainly owing to base effects).
In 2020 we expect full-year growth to rebound to 4.9% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average about 4%, in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate. There are substantial downside risks to our forecasts; these growth profiles do not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
In full-year 2018 the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to a peak of 16.4% (from 11.1% in 2017). In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a broadly stable lira (against the US dollar), a limited increase in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. On average, we forecast inflation of 15.2% in 2019-only marginally below the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 9.1% as global oil prices decline and the exchange rate depreciates only slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of 7.1%-still above the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2018 the lira depreciated by 24.5% against the US dollar (in nominal terms). The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching a low point of TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, the lira remained broadly stable against the US dollar in the remainder of the year. This was due to the decrease in tensions between the US and Turkey, the sharp reduction in the current-account deficit (a direct result of the currency depreciation) and the tight monetary policy stance of the central bank, which reassured foreign investors of the bank's independence.
In 2019 we forecast that the lira will continue to depreciate on average against the US dollar, albeit at a much more moderate pace than in 2018. A normalising economic and financial domestic situation will support the exchange rate. However, there will be an increase in global risk aversion as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war are fully felt, the cooling of the global economy causes expectations of a recession in some advanced economies to build and central banks in advanced economies tighten their monetary policy stances. As a result, we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.6:US$1 in 2019.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable as the economy starts to grow more markedly after an expected slump in 2018-19. Thereafter in 2021-23 we expect a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.2:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP narrowed in 2018, to an estimated 4.5%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar depressed imports (owing to a deceleration in domestic demand) and boosted export competitiveness.
In 2019-23 we expect a smaller average annual current-account deficit of 3.5% of GDP. Significant gains in competitiveness from past lira depreciation, which moderated inflation, and the emergence of spare capacity will result in a boost to exports and a compression in imports over the medium term.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Manoeuvring ahead of the presidential and legislative elections in 2019 will create tensions and distract from efforts to contain security threats and the implementation of much-needed economic reform.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
The 2019 elections will be a close contest between the ruling All Progressives Congress and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). We expect that the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will win, but that the next administration will face the same divisions as the current one.
Policy reform-particularly in the vital oil industry-will be slow as a result of divisions in the political elite between advocates of tough, unpopular market reforms and those who pander to nationalistic and pro-subsidy interest groups.
Inertia over key economic reforms will at times actively decelerate growth. The Central Bank of Nigeria will not act completely independently, and the overall policy agenda will be pulled in differing directions by various powerful interest groups.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers.
The authorities will continue to intervene in the foreign-exchange market, although the naira will nonetheless depreciate in 2019-21. Higher oil prices will then lessen the need for manipulation and the naira will stabilise in 2022-23.
The current account will record surpluses throughout the forecast period, with some output gains in the oil sector and supportive world oil prices. The difficult business environment will restrict the development of non-oil exports.

Nigeria's business environment score will improve slightly but its global and regional rankings will worsen as the administration struggles with the reform process and other countries make more significant improvements.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party presses for deregulation, but the legislature is unlikely to be amenable.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Confusion over oil sector reform creates ongoing uncertainty for investors. The government favours local companies in oil sector deals.
2021-23: Clearer policy lines help to stem the trend of lower investment in the oil and gas sectors, but mistrust between the numerous stakeholders prevents any major upturn in foreign direct investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Political upheaval around the 2019 elections delays reforms that would make trading across borders easier.
2021-23: A premium between the official and the black-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Retroactive measures become a possibility, although the business community would fight these.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation. Efforts to increase value-added tax (VAT) and to move more of the informal economy into the formal sector see non-oil collection also improve.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically once the 2019 elections are concluded, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts national savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and the army soon became the dominant political player. Multiparty democracy was restored in 1999. That presidential poll and the next one, in 2003, were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election-the first time an incumbent had been defeated at the ballot box and an important step forward for the country's democracy.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties dominate the political process. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the only political party to attract nationwide support, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015. Although the 36 state governments enjoy significant autonomy, almost all remain dependent on the federal government for funding.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is contentious, and currency liberalisation will be postponed whenever foreign-exchange supplies permit.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. Tax compliance is a time-consuming process.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by an overvalued exchange rate and massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts severe outbreaks of instability, given slow progress on tackling numerous security and societal challenges at a time of economic difficulty. A concerted effort is needed to eliminate the Islamist terrorist organisation Boko Haram in the north-east and bring an end to conflict between settled farmers and pastoralists in central Nigeria. Both of these problems are increasing in terms of the devastation being caused. Ahead of elections in February 2019 policymakers will be distracted, and the polls themselves will be a time of high risk, with possible disputation of the results. This is more likely if the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) lose the presidency, with many of its cadres sure that the vote will be rigged. However, our baseline forecast is that the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will lose power, and that the next government will be led by Atiku Abubakar of the PDP. Even if the election passes peacefully the new government will be faced with the same insoluble security problems as the outgoing administration. Boko Haram is resurgent, militancy in the oil-producing Niger Delta is an omnipresent threat, and clashes between herders and farmers are becoming more intense as a result of increasing competition for scarce water and land. Nigeria's overstretched military will be unable to decisively end violence in either region, with meagre federal government resources being stretched too thin. It will also prove hard to create economic opportunities for local populations; poverty and rising unemployment are at the root of much of the instability.
Parliamentary rifts will be another problem. Both of Nigeria's main parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP, lack any clear ideology, and most legislators prioritise their constituents' needs over party. As different regions have competing interests and vastly different priorities, the collective resolve needed to bring permanent peace to unstable parts of Nigeria will be lacking.
Our central forecast is, however, that the 2019 elections will be completed without a widespread breakdown in order, with Nigeria's democracy proving robust enough to endure once again. However, major unrest in a localised form will continue as comprehensive solutions prove too complex and politically costly to implement. Speculation over the threat of a military coup or a civil war is likely to surface periodically but we consider a widespread breakdown of security to be unlikely; the military has become more professional and has been depoliticised since the junta stepped aside in 1999. Meanwhile, there is little appetite beyond extremist agitators for a return to civil war, given memories of how disastrous the 1967-70 conflict was for the country. Nonetheless, as the country's leadership struggles to shift Nigeria onto a more sustainable path to economic development, the risks to stability will intensify as more and more Nigerians question what they have to lose from pushing for violent change.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Presidential and legislative elections are due in February 2019. Mr Buhari is the APC's presidential candidate, and his main challenger is Mr Abubakar-who was confirmed as the PDP's candidate in early October after winning overwhelming backing from party members. Launching his election campaign on November 19th, Mr Abubakar has pledged to reinvigorate the economy with pro-market reforms. Both candidates are from northern Nigeria, where Mr Buhari's support base lies, presaging a fierce contest there. With the vote likely to be split in the north, Mr Abubakar will find it easier to garner support from the country's south, which has traditionally been a PDP stronghold. This gives Mr Abubakar an edge, as does popular frustration over the rise in joblessness and poverty (two of the biggest concerns of voters) on Mr Buhari's watch. Growing instability in north-eastern and central Nigeria also denies the incumbent much in the way of achievements to boast of while in office; he was given a clear mandate in 2015 to restore law and order. Nonetheless, strong incumbency advantages in Nigeria imply that it will be a very tight race. If Mr Abubakar loses-a distinct downside risk to our forecast-there may be a rejection of the result by the PDP, which is convinced the election will be rigged. In this scenario, a state of national paralysis could arise, with severe national security implications.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories. Relations with the US will be mixed; the administration of Donald Trump is willing to sell Nigeria military hardware, but Mr Trump's disapproval of the trade deficit the US runs with Nigeria (particularly owing to Nigerian trade barriers on agricultural imports) could strain relations. Ties with the EU will be largely cordial but subject to tensions over the large numbers of Nigerian migrants seeking to enter Europe and Nigerian efforts to repatriate funds in European banks that were allegedly looted by former rulers.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will total only a small proportion of the headline-grabbing pledges made given an extremely challenging local business environment.
Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges will tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Relations with South Africa will remain strained. Africa's two largest economies will continue to compete for political, economic and cultural influence.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Mr Abubakar advocates a pro-business and free-market reform agenda, with more private participation in public services, as well as liberalisation of the oil sector and the exchange rate. His ability to pass wide-ranging economic policy reforms will depend to some extent on the composition of the legislature after the election, but even if it is dominated by the PDP, overhauling Nigeria's currency regime (and thereby unleashing a temporary inflationary spike and upsetting those who benefit from an overvalued exchange rate) or dissociating the federal government from the hydrocarbons sector-from which it gets most of its revenue-would be a momentous battle. Putting the downstream oil sector in private hands, as Mr Abubakar has posited, would also mean lifting price controls. (For many Nigerians, price controls are the only visible way that the federal government impinges on their daily lives.) Assuming the state retains much of its interest in the oil sector, related issues will still need to be resolved, including fiscal terms and revenue management. Oil companies, workers and local politicians (not to mention various militant groups) will all pull in different directions. However, there is a distinct upside risk that progress on free-market reform will be more rapid than under our baseline forecast. Mr Buhari has been ideologically disposed towards state intervention in the economy, meaning there was little cause for him to overhaul the status quo. A more concerted effort to open up the economy to investment by Mr Abubakar could produce positive results.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy will centre on attempting to diversify sources of revenue away from oil while directing more expenditure to pro-poor activities and infrastructure investment. Non-oil revenue will rise because of efforts to widen tax coverage and collect overdue taxes, but from an extremely low base. Instability in many parts of the country will also be an impediment. More importantly, oil production targets budgeted for by the government are repeatedly overambitious; for example in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day-a level not seen for well over a decade, and one that will be unobtainable given antiquated oil infrastructure. Total revenue is not expected to rise above 3.4% of GDP, a ratio only attained in 2023 when oil prices are at their highest within the forecast period.
After some projected expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with deep cuts to the capital budget. Partly offsetting this will be a rise in populist recurrent spending on wages and public-sector benefits. Generally, flexibility on spending will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and a costly petrol subsidy, as well as pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and so revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only begin to increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether we expect an average budget deficit equal to 2% of GDP over 2019-23.
Although higher oil prices will give some reprieve, longer-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against a low revenue base. Debt service already takes up close to one-third of federal government income, and yields on government securities are increasing as global monetary conditions tighten and foreign investors repatriate capital. A federal government default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is even weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on bolstering economic recovery while limiting inflation and maintaining currency stability. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The private sector is desperate for cheaper credit, but inflation will remain above the targeted upper limit of 9% set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). On balance, interest rates will not move much in 2019, but they will dip in 2020 as the wider global economy slows and the monetary authorities attempt to stimulate activity, with Nigeria following suit. Rates will then stabilise in 2021-23 as economic activity picks up and inflation remains above target. However, real interest rates will be too high to support private-sector activity outside of highly profitable ventures. The CBN also faces an issue over its independence. Mr Abubakar has expressed concern about state interference in the CBN's affairs, but it remains to be seen if independence would be made secure under his presidency.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019 what are expected to be fiercely contested elections in February will hold back business and consumer confidence. Although markets are likely to approve of Mr Abubakar's economic reform agenda-meaning the disruption is likely to be short-lived-high local borrowing costs will hold back investment ,and we forecast a growth rate of 1.9%; this is the lowest annual rate of growth in our five-year outlook period. Growth will increase in 2020 as uncertainty passes, but only moderately-as an expected slowdown in the world economy holds back export-oriented sectors. In 2021-23, as global markets strengthen and external demand picks up, the rate of growth will quicken to an annual average of 3%. This is well below potential, with numerous factors holding the economy back.
In terms of sectoral growth, agriculture will record only lacklustre growth; although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will be huge impediments. Industrial production will be severely curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, holding back production even when prices are relatively high. An infrastructure deficit and a legacy of chronic underinvestment will also constrain hydrocarbons production, which is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by trade protectionism and tight credit conditions (particularly affecting areas such as real estate and finance), as well as the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From an estimated rate of 11.2% in 2018, average inflation will increase to 13.8% in 2019, as the naira enters a period of managed depreciation and pre-election giveaways (including a substantial increase in the minimum wage) add to upward price pressures. Inflation will edge up further, to 14.2% in 2020, on the back of a weakening currency. Thereafter, with only a modest depreciation in 2021 followed by currency stability, inflation will ease to a still-high average of 9.7% in 2023. Preventing a faster slide will be protectionist measures that limit relatively cheap imports from abroad, particularly of food. If Mr Abubakar goes ahead with an unofficial proposal to fully float the naira, inflation would exceed these forecasts by a considerable margin. (Nigeria is heavily dependent on imports, and consumer prices are highly sensitive to currency movements.)
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with a notable differential between the official rate used for government business and the market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters (with various other rates in between). Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons. Oil prices, and with them the level of hard-currency earnings, will in large part dictate where the authorities are able to hold the official rate and what the premium is between the official and the market rates. In 2019 political events (such as the magnitude of instability that accompanies the election period) will also have an impact, and jitters will cause the official rate to drop from an estimated average of N305.6:US$1 in 2018 to N316.3:US$1. A widening spread between the official and parallel rate supports this view. With oil prices forecast to decline in 2020, and with a cumulative real appreciation in previous years, we expect a further fall in the value of the naira, to an average of N355.8:US$1. As oil prices pick up on average over the rest of the forecast period, we expect the naira to receive greater support, with an average rate of N377.9:US$1 in 2023.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. However, indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The export profile will move in tandem with oil production trends and world crude prices. With some oil export volume gains expected in 2019 (as a key pipeline that disrupted exports in 2018 resumes operations) and reasonably flat world oil prices, export earnings will increase. Exports will then dip in 2020 in line with a drop in world oil prices, before strengthening in 2021-22 as oil prices recover. In 2023 prices will dip but output will rise slightly, thereby supporting a further modest rise in export earnings. After a one-off surge in capital imports in 2018, imports will contract in 2019 to levels more consistent with the (weak) short-term demand outlook. From there will follow steady import growth led by an economic recovery, with the rate of increase especially fast in 2022-23 as the naira stabilises. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation will pick up, in line with faster economic growth and increased oil-sector activity. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will broadly track movements in world oil prices, narrowing from 4.1% of GDP in 2019 to 2.8% of GDP in 2020, then widening again to 3.6% of GDP by 2022 before retreating again to 3.4% of GDP in 2023.

The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis, the traditional party system has broken down. The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-that took office in September 2015 has only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. [...]tensions within the coalition persist about a range of issues, including the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019c 2020c 2021c 2022c 2023c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 Labour force (% change) -0.9 -0.1 -0.1 -0.3 -1.1 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 0.1 0.0 Employment (m) 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.9 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 Employment (% change) 0.5 1.9 1.8 2.4 1.8 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Unemployment (m) 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.7 Unemployment rate (av; %) 26.6 25.0 23.5 21.5 19.2 18.1 17.0 15.8 15.0 14.2 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) -1.3 -1.7 -0.8 1.1 0.8 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.5 1.5 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) -1.4 -1.1 0.0 1.1 0.8 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.5 1.5 Producer prices (av) -0.8 -5.8 -5.4 4.2 3.8 2.3 1.9 2.8 2.8 2.8 GDP deflator (av) -1.9 -0.3 -0.1 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.9 0.6 1.0 Private consumption deflator (av) -2.6 -1.6 -0.7 0.5 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.0 1.0 Government consumption deflator (av) -1.0 -2.4 -0.7 1.2 1.8 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.5 1.5 Fixed investment deflator (av) -1.8 -1.7 -0.3 0.6 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Average nominal wages 0.5 -0.9 1.3 0.8 3.5 2.6 1.6 1.8 1.8 1.8 Average real wages 1.8 0.8 2.2 -0.3 2.7 1.5 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) -0.2 1.0 2.9 1.2b 0.0 1.3 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.3 Unit labour costs, business sector (US$) -0.2 -15.7 2.6 3.3b 7.7 2.0 2.6 -0.3 2.4 0.3 Labour costs per hour ([euro])d 13.7 13.6 13.9 14.0b 14.6 15.0 15.2 15.6 15.9 16.2 Labour costs per hour, manufacturing (US$)d 18.2 15.1 15.3 15.8b 17.2 17.8 18.6 18.9 19.7 20.1 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Includes pay for time worked, other direct pay (eg holiday pay), employer expenditure on legally required insurance programmes and other labour taxes.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. It is vulnerable to further defections, especially regarding the implementation of further austerity measures and the Macedonia name-change agreement reached in June 2018.
The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that an early election will be held before the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019, possibly in conjunction with the European Parliament and the local elections in May 2019. We expect the centre-right New Democracy (ND) to win the most seats and to form a government. However, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality in the medium term, until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's creditors. Mr Tsipras's promises to lower tax and reverse spending cuts could cause tensions with the country's international creditors and investors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
We expect that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.4% in 2017 to a moderate 2% per year on average in 2018-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 175% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove to be difficult.
We estimate that annual average inflation will ease, from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.8% in 2018, before rising to an annual average of 1% in 2019 and about 1.5% in 2020-23), reflecting a moderate pick-up in domestic demand and higher energy prices. This will result in still moderate current-account deficits in 2018-23.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment, as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Remaining capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eliminated. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's financing needs.
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) are slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: The need to increase provisions for still high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis, the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages, totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR28bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR47.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR3.2bn, equivalent to 1.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Instability is set to increase during the busy electoral cycle in 2019, further weakening Greece's governance and its commitment to political and economic reform. Local and European Parliament elections are due to be held in late May, and national legislative elections are due by October, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to be called early, possibly in conjunction with the elections in May. The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-that took office in September 2015 has only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Moreover, tensions within the coalition persist about a range of issues, including the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. Two members of the AE defected in protest against the agreement reached with Macedonia to end the 27-year name dispute in June, leaving the government with a majority of just two seats.
In a consultative referendum held on September 30th Macedonians voted overwhelmingly in favour of changing their country's official name from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (its constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia) to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia). Despite the low turnout of well below 50% at the referendum, the agreement is now in its final stage of approval by the Macedonian parliament. However, the Syriza-led coalition government may struggle to ratify the deal if it is brought before the Greek parliament in early 2019, as is currently envisaged. The AE, which is now reduced to seven seats, has said that it will oppose the agreement.
In August 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. During this period in power, Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election, although it may receive a boost in popularity after the European Commission accepted the government's plan to cancel agreed pension cuts in 2019 on the grounds that they will not be needed in order to achieve the country's fiscal targets (a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018-22). We remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could lead to delays in the implementation of the debt relief measures agreed with Greece's EU creditors.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has exceeded 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the Syriza government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political instability, and protracted economic and financial crisis, have limited Greece's influence in the EU and the Balkans region. Recent efforts to restore influence, including the Macedonian name-change agreement with Macedonia and talks on closer co-operation with the US, are fraught with difficulty as domestic pre-election tension is likely to condition foreign policy decisions. The Macedonia agreement remains a major source of tension within the Syriza-led coalition government. If the Macedonian parliament gives final approval to the related constitutional changes, as we expect, and the Greek parliament fails to ratify agreement, the decision could seriously damage Greece's relations with its Western allies, who strongly support the agreement in order to end Greece's opposition to Macedonia's accession to NATO and to its application for EU membership.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have been threatening to boil over, increasing the risk of military hostility, particularly in the Aegean Sea. However, we believe that both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in August of two Greek soldiers arrested in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Despite exiting the third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line, the government will still be subject to huge policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond. General government debt is huge, at an estimated 185% of GDP in 2018 and also almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, highly unlikely.
In June Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released in August. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs to end-2020. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
In June EU creditors also agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2018-22.
In response, Greece has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after its exit from the bail-out programme in August, it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term. In the medium and long term, however, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short- or medium-term risk; however, given that Greece is unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will represent a possibility in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Greece recorded an overall budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP and a primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.9% in 2017, exceeding the bail-out programme target of 1.75%. From 2018 we expect fiscal performance to deteriorate gradually, with the budget balance returning to moderately widening headline deficits and primary surpluses falling well short of the official target of 3.5% of GDP for 2018-22, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP from 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve, owing to the fact that debt repayments become much more onerous from that year on.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be more than 170% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The programme is running at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. After real GDP growth of 1.4% in 2017, we estimate growth of 2.1% in 2018. In 2019-23 real GDP growth will remain constrained at an average of 1.9%. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism performance, if capacity constraints are addressed. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Our estimate for 2018 real GDP growth is a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more-and higher-taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by an average of 6.2% year on year in the first three quarters of 2018. Despite an expected modest quarter-on-quarter increase in the final three months of 2018, we now expect a full-year contraction of 7.5%, followed by average annual growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still about 50% below its 2007 peak. Underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. In the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 8.2% in 2018, and 4.2% in 2019-23.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs in the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. Although risks have abated since the height of the financial crisis, we believe that there is a risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Greece's exiting of the euro zone (not our core scenario) would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
After averaging 1.1% in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate (seasonally adjusted, EU harmonised) dipped sharply at the start of 2018, before increasing moderately in May-October. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack in the labour market, subdued domestic demand and recent decreases in global oil prices will dampen inflationary pressures. We expect that inflation will pick up only modestly, from an estimated average of 0.8% in 2018 to 1% in 2019 and 1.5% per year in 2020-23 as the pace of domestic demand growth quickens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. It peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July before weakening to US$1.13:EUR1 in mid-August. The euro recovered some value in September-October, but weakened again in November-December to US$1.13-1.14:EUR1, and will remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US. We expect it to begin strengthening against the US dollar from the second half of 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2019 and then US$1.22:EUR1 in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is gradually tightened. The euro will also receive structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the economic crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit widened from 0.8% of GDP in 2015 to an average of 1.8% of GDP per year in 2016-17, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We expect continued deficits in 2018-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand and moderately higher global energy prices, but these deficits will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Following a snap general election in June 2017, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, the prime minister, Theresa May, formed a minority government based on a "confidence and supply" agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect the government to last a full five-year term, as it will face domestic and external challenges during the Brexit process.
Mrs May will continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in her cabinet that have different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. Divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit have intensified, and there is a high risk that the withdrawal agreement will be rejected in the UK parliament. Our baseline forecast is that it will be narrowly approved (either in a first or a second vote) in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit in March 2019, which would cause severe disruption.
Talks on the future UK-EU trading relationship will take place throughout 2019-20. If no trade deal is reached by July 2020, we expect the transition period, during which the UK will maintain access to the single market, to be extended from 2020. The UK and the EU have committed to negotiating a free-trade area with deep regulatory and customs co-operation. However, the details of the future relationship will depend on the outcome of complex negotiations. We expect a trade agreement to be implemented during 2021, but possibly later.
The economy was resilient following the Brexit vote, growing by 1.8% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017, but lost momentum in 2018, as rising inflation and uncertainty surrounding the negotiations dampened domestic demand. We forecast that inflation will ease in 2019, supporting real household incomes and consumer spending, and allowing real GDP growth to recover slightly, to 1.5%. Brexit-related uncertainty will remain high but should recede in 2020-23, when we expect real GDP growth to average 1.7%.
The government's budget deficit has narrowed from 4.2% of GDP in 2015 to an estimated 1.3% of GDP in 2018. After some fiscal easing in 2019, we expect a gradual contraction in the deficit from 2020, reaching 0.5% by 2023. The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has started to raise interest rates again, after doing so in November 2017 for the first time in a decade. We expect the next 25-basis-point increase, to 1%, in the second quarter of 2019.

The UK's business environment score improves in the 2019-23 forecast period compared with 2014-18, lifting the UK by two places in the global ranking and by one place in the regional ranking. Brexit introduces policy uncertainty, but the county's strengths-a pro-business policy stance, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will continue.
Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Government retains large stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland. Public support for energy and renationalisation of the rail sector.
2021-23: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks after Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Reduced foreign investor activity. Government "assurances" encourage investment in automotive sector.
2021-23: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: UK formally leaves EU, but likely transitional agreement to end-2020 implies that status quo arrangements will largely continue. Tensions over Irish border. Talks begin on UK-EU free-trade agreement. Modest risk of "no deal" and hard Brexit.
2021-23: Expected decline in UK-EU crossborder trade. Some new UK-EU trading arrangement possibly phased in.
Taxes
2019-20: Gradual rise in personal income tax allowance, but also in total tax burden. Modest changes to business rates.
2021-23: Planned cut in corporation tax rate, to 17%. Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to growing tax avoidance and evasion. Possible changes to the value-added tax (VAT) framework if the UK leaves the EU's VAT regime after 2020.
Financing
2019-20: Monetary policy is tightened gradually, but remains highly accommodative. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Steady growth in alternative forms of debt financing.
2021-23: Expected loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade. Modest decline in City of London's status.
The labour market
2019-20: Firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Phased increase in compulsory national living wage.
2021-23: Some restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but likely to be flexible in response to business concerns.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operation.
2021-23: Construction of high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. EU-funded investment falls.
Technological readiness
2019-20: High e-commerce penetration and strong research base, but UK research and development (R&D) spending below EU average and limited provision of e-government services. Continued high threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.
2021-23: Possible weakening of research and innovation framework owing to exit from-or more restricted access to-EU structural programmes (such as Horizon 2020) and project financing schemes. Modest rise in public R&D spending.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The snap general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The main opposition Labour Party gained 30 seats at the 2017 election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis. The monetary stance is being tightened, but remains exceptionally loose by historical standards. Real GDP growth slowed modestly in 2016-17 compared with 2015. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Fiscal policy will be eased slightly in 2019, but deficit reduction remains a medium-term priority for the government. Managing Brexit has forced policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 19% since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2017 exports of goods totalled US$436.4bn and imports amounted to US$613bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$176.6bn. The services surplus rose to US$147.5bn. The overall current-account deficit narrowed in absolute terms, to US$98.4bn, from US$140.3bn in 2016, and fell sharply as a share of GDP, from 5.3% to 3.7%.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Following an early general election in June 2017, the Conservative Party formed a working government based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with the Northern Ireland-based Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The government is politically fragile and, amid domestic and external challenges, is unlikely to last a full term to 2022. The biggest challenge for the prime minister, Theresa May, is to reconcile opposing factions in the cabinet that have different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU.
Divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches reflect deep-seated discontent with the direction in which Mrs May is taking the Brexit negotiations. These divisions will come to a head on December 11th, when members of parliament (MPs) will debate and hold a "meaningful vote" on the draft withdrawal agreement reached by UK and EU negotiators in mid-November. The contents of the deal have already triggered ministerial resignations; the relatively unknown Stephen Barclay has replaced Dominic Raab as Brexit secretary, and Amber Rudd has replaced Esther McVey as secretary of state for work and pensions.
Most Conservative MPs intending to reject the withdrawal deal in December believe that it surrenders an unacceptable degree of sovereignty to the EU. A major area of concern is the backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU customs union. If a trading arrangement that removes the border is not found, the backstop would keep the UK in a single customs territory with the EU. This includes "level-playing field" requirements that keep the UK aligned to a broad range of rules and standards to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage. Crucially, however, the UK would not be able to unilaterally withdraw from the arrangement. The DUP plans to vote against the withdrawal agreement because the backstop arrangement also keeps Northern Ireland aligned to a limited set of single-market rules, tying it more closely to the EU than to the UK. The opposition Labour Party has declared its intention to vote against the withdrawal agreement on the grounds that it fails the party's six "tests" against which it measures the Brexit deal. Pro-EU MPs may vote against the deal, as they favour the possibility of calling a second referendum on EU membership.
Mrs May has launched a campaign to get the deal through parliament, but the parliamentary arithmetic is not in her favour. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that she will eventually get the deal approved-potentially in a second vote after some amendments-owing to a lack of alternative options that can guarantee an orderly UK withdrawal when the Article 50 window closes at the end of March 2019. The EU has stated that negotiations on the terms of withdrawal are closed, and may not extend the Article 50 window. A second referendum might lead to a decision to revoke Article 50, but would be politically divisive. In addition, many MPs will be wary of voting against the deal and triggering a general election, in which they could lose their seats.
Nevertheless, downside risks to our forecast are high and contingency plans for a "no-deal" Brexit have been ramped up. The political pressure on Mrs May has also increased significantly. She has avoided, for now, a no-confidence vote. Should this happen, we expect her to survive it in the short term, but if the withdrawal agreement is rejected, Mrs May would lose all authority and would probably be ousted. In this scenario, either the existing government under new leadership or a new government formed following a general election may seek to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and/or call a second referendum.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for May 2022. Assuming that parliament approves the UK's withdrawal deal with the EU in late-2018, the Conservative-led government is likely to hold in the short term. Neither the Conservatives nor the DUP wants another election-they are allies on matters of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power, given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is fragile, and political deadlock over the direction of Brexit negotiations could lead to an early election.
Since April most opinion polls have placed the Conservatives ahead of Labour by a few percentage points, but this lead could easily collapse during the course of an election campaign. The outcome of the next election will be largely determined by how well the Conservatives are perceived to have handled the Brexit negotiations.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
The UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process, in March 2019. The mid-November agreement with the EU on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and a political declaration on the shape of the future relationship were finalised at an EU summit on November 25th. The withdrawal agreement contains a transition period, which will last until end-2020 and will allow the UK to maintain access to the single market during negotiations on the shape of the future UK-EU trading relationship. However, according to the withdrawal agreement, the UK and the EU have until July 2020 to agree on a future trade agreement, otherwise they must agree to operationalise the backstop for the Irish border from the start of 2021, or extend the transition period. If no trade deal is agreed before July 2020, we expect the transition period to be extended for a short time, allowing a deal to come into effect during 2021, but possibly later.
We expect trade negotiations to result in a comprehensive free-trade agreement that includes special provisions for some sectors, for example those where supply chains are highly integrated. The UK and the EU have committed to negotiating a free-trade area with deep regulatory and customs co-operation. They will pursue an equivalence regime for financial services, and mobility arrangements will be reciprocal. However, the details of the future relationship in these areas, including transport arrangements, energy, fishing opportunities, security and institutional arrangements, will depend on the outcome of complex negotiations.
The UK will pursue an independent trade policy after Brexit, and it is focusing on improving trade ties with a number of countries, including the US, Australia and New Zealand. The government is also considering joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes several countries in Asia, Australasia and Latin America. However, UK-EU trade negotiations will take priority in the coming years, and the scope of non-EU trade agreements will be limited by the degree to which the UK remains aligned with EU regulations.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The UK's departure from the EU has encouraged policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth. In 2016 the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and development over the next five years. We expect these measures to support a recovery in productivity, but they are too modest in scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The government's legislative agenda has been dominated by Brexit since mid-2017; eight of the 27 bills announced in the Queen's Speech in June of that year related to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In the Autumn Budget, delivered on October 29th, Mr Hammond declared that austerity was coming to an end, but that "discipline will remain". Public borrowing has been lower than expected this year, and therefore more funds were allocated to the National Health Service (NHS) and to support the troubled rollout of Universal Credit (a form of social welfare payment). The chancellor also announced a number of pro-business measures aimed at stimulating investment, and a new digital-services tax that will increase the amount of tax paid by "established tech giants", such as Amazon and Google (both US). The personal allowance threshold, under which no income tax is paid, will be increased from £11,850 (US$15,117) currently to £12,500 in 2019, one year earlier than planned.
Owing to a decline in public borrowing in 2018, we estimate a calendar-year fiscal deficit equivalent to 1.3% of GDP, down from 1.8% in 2017. However, the fiscal easing announced in the budget should mean that the deficit will widen slightly in 2019, to 1.5% of GDP. In the event of a smooth Brexit in 2019, Mr Hammond has promised a "deal dividend" that will allow further fiscal easing, although it is uncertain that this will materialise. In the remainder of our 2019-23 forecast period we expect the government to decrease discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to narrow again in 2020, to 1.3% of GDP, and to reach 0.5% by 2023. We expect public debt to decline from about 87% of GDP in 2018 to less than 80% by 2022.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted unanimously to keep its policy interest rate unchanged in November, at 0.75%, having increased it by 25 basis points in both August 2018 and November 2017-the first rate increase in a decade. Once the influence of higher energy and import prices on inflation has faded, the BoE expects domestic price pressures to build, keeping inflation above its 2% target in the coming years. This outlook has justified the decision to tighten monetary policy since late 2017, although this will depend on the nature of the Brexit process. Economic uncertainty is heightened, and the bank has said that further rate increases will be "limited and gradual". We expect the BoE to delay the next policy rate increase until the second quarter of 2019, and follow that with four more rises that will take the rate to 2.5% by end-2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.8% and 1.7% respectively. However, the pace of growth slowed sharply in early 2018, partly reflecting the impact of adverse weather conditions on activity. Despite a modest rebound in the third quarter, we expect political turmoil and associated economic uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations to have weighed on activity in the fourth quarter. In response, we have revised down slightly our estimate of full-year GDP growth in 2018, from 1.4% to 1.3%. Nevertheless, we expect some degree of economic confidence to return in early 2019, assuming that the withdrawal agreement negotiated in late 2018 will make a smooth Brexit transition possible in March 2019. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2019.
The economic slowdown in 2018 has been led by a deceleration in domestic demand, but we expect it to firm slightly in 2019. Consumer spending will continue to be supported by recent employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a decline in the savings ratio. Consumer spending weakened in 2018, as high inflation reduced real household incomes, but we expect this effect to fade in 2019 as external price pressure-from the past depreciation in sterling and high oil prices-eases. Persistent Brexit-related uncertainty and slower employment growth will weigh on the pace of consumer spending growth in 2020-21. We expect growth to strengthen in 2022-owing to pent-up demand as uncertainty recedes-but to moderate thereafter.
Businesses have been particularly sensitive to Brexit-related uncertainty in 2018, leading to a decline in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), despite accommodative financial conditions. After a deceleration in GFCF growth in 2018, we expect it to firm gradually for most of the forecast period as uncertainty recedes and capacity constraints make capital spending necessary. Nevertheless, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of recovery in both consumer spending and GCFC during these years.
In 2017 export volumes benefited from a competitiveness boost from sterling's depreciation following the Brexit referendum. This effect faded in 2018, but we expect export growth to remain firm in 2019-20, before slowing in 2021-23 as the UK's new relationship with the EU (which we expect to take effect during 2021) weakens trade flows. Services exports will be particularly weak during this period, reflecting our expectation that services will not feature in the trade agreement. The weaker domestic demand environment is reducing import growth this year, but a recovery in 2019-23 should mean that the external balance will exert an increasing drag on GDP growth from 2020.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
The headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner-occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-accelerated to 2.6% on average in 2017, from 1% in 2016. The increase partly reflected a rebound in oil prices, but was amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling following the Brexit vote. The pass-through from sterling's weakness has since faded, producing an average inflation rate of 2.3% in January-October, in line with our full-year estimate. As tighter monetary policy offsets firming domestic price pressure (particularly wage growth), we forecast that inflation will ease to 2% next year and 2.1% on average in 2020-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Following a sharp decline in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote, the pound depreciated against both the euro and the US dollar in 2017. It has since recovered some value against the dollar, but after significant volatility related to the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit, the pound is on course to weaken slightly more against the euro on average this year. In 2019 foreign-exchange markets will remain sensitive to Brexit, contributing to significant volatility in the pound. We expect a modest "relief rally" in the pound to accompany the agreement and ratification of the UK withdrawal deal, set to take place at the end of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 respectively. However, we expect the pound to lose value against the euro thereafter and in 2020, partly reflecting the difficulty in finalising Brexit negotiations, but also owing to tighter monetary policy in the euro zone. We expect an average exchange rate of EUR1.13:£1 in 2018-19 (revised slightly lower from EUR1.14:£1), weakening to EUR1.11:£1 in 2020. We then expect it to recover modestly, to EUR1.14:£1 on average in 2021-23, as a new UK-EU trade relationship is established. Against the US dollar, we expect the pound to average US$1.35:£1 in 2019-20, before recovering more value in 2021-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit has narrowed in recent years, from about 5% in 2013-16 to 3.7% in 2017. We expect it to widen slightly in 2018-19 as a decline in the services surplus offsets a slight narrowing in the trade deficit. By 2020 we expect the current-account deficit to widen to 4.3% of GDP as domestic demand recovers. From 2021 we expect looser trade relations with the EU to mean a larger goods trade deficit and a smaller services surplus, although this will be partially offset by a reduction in secondary transfers as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget. We forecast an annual average current-account deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2021-23.
In 2017 foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows totalled US$64.7b; we expect Brexit-related uncertainty to mean that they will dip below US$20bn by 2019. We forecast that they will recover gradually, to almost US$80bn by 2023. Net FDI flows are currently negative, but we expect them to turn positive in 2021-23 as confidence in the UK economy recovers after Brexit.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament and it is vulnerable to further defections, especially regarding the implementation of further austerity measures and the Macedonia name change agreement reached in June.
The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that an early election will be held before the end of the parliamentary term in October 2019, possibly in conjunction with the European Parliament and the local elections in May 2019. We expect the centre-right New Democracy (ND) to win the most seats and to form a government, but it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Greece will remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests are likely to continue as the government strives to meet ambitious annual primary surplus budget targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and 2.2% from 2023, as agreed with Greece's creditors. Mr Tsipras's promises to lower tax, reverse spending cuts and abandon the pension reform could cause tensions with the country's international creditors and investors.
Greece is facing its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it has exited the bail-out programme and no longer has access to official borrowing at preferential interest rates. However, Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties, as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments until the end of 2020. A Greek exit from the euro zone represents a risk over the long term.
We expect that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to a moderate 2% per year on average in 2018-23. Public debt is forecast to continue to exceed 170% of GDP in 2023. Meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness will prove difficult.
We estimate that annual average inflation will ease, from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.8% in 2018, before rising to an annual average of 1.4% in the forecast period (2019-23), reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These factors will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-23.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment, as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The country's privatisation agency (under new management) gains momentum, unblocking some delayed deals.
2021-23: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2021-23: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. Capital buffer of about EUR26bn sufficient to cover almost two years of the government's financing needs
2021-23: There is a significant risk of Greece leaving the euro zone in the long term if growth continues to disappoint. Grexit would probably result in the reintroduction of exchange controls, and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes
2019-20: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2021-23: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2019-20: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) extremely slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2021-23: Lending hampered by need to increase provisions for still high NPLs. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market
2019-20: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2021-23: EU funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2021-23: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption of funds persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2021-23: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard..

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of the EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis, the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme in August 2015. In 2012 Greece restructured its public debt, reducing the value of private-sector creditors' holdings by EUR107bn. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. Now that Greece has exited the programme, it is subject to an "enhanced supervision" monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.8bn, equivalent to 1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. However, tensions within the coalition persist on a range of issues, including the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. Two members of the AE defected in protest to the agreement reached with Macedonia on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute in June, leaving the government with a majority of just two seats. Mr Tsipras insists that he intends to see the parliamentary term through to its end, in October 2019, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a pre-term election, possibly to be held in conjunction with the European Parliament and the local elections in May 2019.
Following a consultative referendum held on September 30th in which Macedonians voted overwhelmingly in favour of changing their country's official name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia), the Macedonian parliament has begun the process of ratifying the agreement, despite the turnout of well below 50% at the referendum. The fragility of the Syriza-led coalition government means that it may struggle to ratify the agreement if it is brought before the Greek parliament in early 2019, as is currently envisaged. The AE, which is now reduced to seven seats, has said that it will oppose the agreement.
On August 20th 2018, after eight years of austerity and unpopular reforms under three economic adjustment programmes, Greece exited the third bail-out programme signed by the Syriza-led government in 2015. However, during this period in power, Mr Tsipras has lost much popular support and will struggle to revive his party's political fortunes before the next election. The party will receive a boost in popularity after the European Commission accepts the government's plan to cancel agreed pension cuts in 2019 on the grounds that they will not be needed in order to achieve the country's fiscal targets (a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018-22). However, we remain sceptical that real GDP growth will rise much higher than 2% during the 2019-23 forecast period, and expect that failure to implement other structural reforms agreed with Greece's international creditors could lead to delays in the implementation of debt relief measures.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has exceeded 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner, whereas there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as we expect, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
In mid-June 2018 Greece and Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia) reached an agreement to change Macedonia's constitutional name to Northern Macedonia, in order to end Greece's opposition to that country's accession to NATO. However, there is strong opposition to the agreement in both countries, and Greece's coalition government is divided on the issue. Although the prospect of ratification by Macedonia has improved slightly, the agreement remains a major source of tension within the Greek government, as illustrated by the resignation on October 17th of the foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, one of the main architects of the agreement.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have been threatening to boil over, increasing the risk of military hostility, particularly in the Aegean Sea. However, we believe that both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey-have fuelled distrust. Turkey's release in mid-August of two Greek soldiers arrested for alleged espionage in March 2018 while on patrol in the border area of Evros has eased tensions slightly.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Despite exiting the third economic adjustment programmes in August 2018 without a precautionary credit line, the government will be subject to huge policy constraints during the forecast period and beyond. General government debt is huge-officially projected to reach EUR335bn by end-2018, or almost 185% of GDP, according to our GDP estimates. It is also now almost entirely owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), so another debt write-down, as happened in 2012, is unlikely.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released on August 6th. Of this, EUR3.3bn was earmarked to repay more expensive IMF debt, and the balance to create a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR26bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money that it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn), and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets, which comprises the official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries. The value of the return is estimated to be about EUR5bn in total in 2018-22.
In response, Greece has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and 2.2% thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after its exit from the bail-out programme in August, it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Recent emerging-market turbulence and investor risk aversion highlight the difficulties that Greece could face in the future on the international capital markets. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term, until end-2020. However, in the medium and long term the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk; however, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or to grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will represent a risk in the long term.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
In 2017 the budget surplus was equivalent to 0.8% of GDP and the primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) exceeded the bail-out programme target of 1.75%, at 3.9%. We estimate a minimal budget deficit in 2018, of 0.2% of GDP, and expect Greece to fall just short of its annual primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP this year and in 2019-22. Although the primary surplus target will decline to 2.2% of GDP in 2023, it will still be difficult to achieve, owing to the fact that debt repayments become much more onerous from that year on. We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually during this period, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt owed to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will still be above 170% at the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The programme is running at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the main refinancing rate to 2% by end-2023. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter, government consumption by almost a quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. After real GDP growth of 1.3% in 2017, we estimate growth of 2% in 2018. In 2019-23 real GDP growth will remain constrained at an average of 1.9%. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism performance, if capacity constraints are addressed. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Seasonally and calendar-day-adjusted real GDP growth slowed from 0.9% quarter on quarter in January-March (2.5% year on year) to 0.2% (1.8% year on year) in April-June, despite steady expansion of domestic consumption and strong export of services (largely driven by tourism). Our estimate for 2018 real GDP growth is a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. We expect a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-23, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by large primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year up to 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
Quarterly gross fixed investment has been volatile in recent years, but recorded strong full-year growth in 2016-17, albeit from a low base. However, reflecting base effects and a loss of momentum, investment contracted by 7.9% year on year in the first half of 2018. We expect a pick-up in the second half of the year to reduce the contraction to 1% in 2018 as whole, followed by average annual growth of 5.2% in 2019-23, leaving fixed investment still about 50% below its 2007 peak. Underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about the country's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term we expect tourism to continue to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 4.7% in 2019-23.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge now that it no longer has access to official external financing at preferential rates. How the economy performs over the next five years (and beyond) will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We believe that there is a significant risk that Greece will exit the euro zone in the long term, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then recover, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the necessity to achieve a primary surplus.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
After averaging 1.1% in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate (seasonally adjusted, EU harmonised) dipped sharply at the start of 2018, before accelerating moderately since May. The economy has returned to growth, but significant slack remains in the labour market, and domestic demand is subdued. Higher global commodity prices and increased tourist demand pushed the annual rate of price growth up to 1.8% in October, but we estimate that inflation will average 0.8% in 2018 (it averaged 0.6% in the first ten months of the year). We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.4% per year on average in 2019-23 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
The euro rallied in late 2017 as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. It peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July before weakening to US$1.13:EUR1 in mid-August. The euro has recovered some value in September-October, but weakened again in November to US$1.13-1.14:EUR1, and will remain under pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US. We expect it to begin strengthening against the US dollar from the second half of 2019, on the assumption that the region's recovery will continue while growth momentum in the US slows. We forecast an average of US$1.19:EUR1 in 2019 and then US$1.21:EUR1 in 2020-21 as monetary policy in the euro zone is gradually tightened. The euro will also receive structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports due to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2017, from 1.3% of GDP in 2016, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We expect widening deficits in 2018-23 as import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand and import prices rise, but these will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: [...]of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.6% of GDP. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. [...]there is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. [...]we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.7:US$1 in 2019.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority in parliament with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2019-23), and possibly beyond.
Following the June elections, an executive presidency has replaced the former parliamentary system of government. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in July 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high and relations could sour quickly.
Turkey's relationship with the US will remain tense. Points of contention include Turkey's pivot towards Iran and Russia (from the US' perspective), and the perceived lack of US support after the failed coup (from Turkey's perspective).
Turkey's relationship with the EU will remain transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
The government's focus on domestic power struggles, economic growth and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth, from 7.3% in 2017 to about 3.5% per year in 2018-23, reflecting the impact of the August 2018 currency crisis, higher interest rates, global trade tensions and more moderate export growth.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar during the forecast period, to about TL6.3:US$1 at end-2023, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and the large current-account deficit.
As a result of the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar (which will boost competitiveness), we forecast that the current-account deficit will shrink in 2019-23, to an annual average of 3.6% of GDP. Turkey will struggle to meet its external financing needs throughout the forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2019-23, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 59th. The failed coup in 2016 and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Political instability and adverse market conditions will delay further privatisation deals.
2021-23: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2021-23: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Capital controls are not considered, despite the scale of the currency collapse. Political tensions resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs and US sanctions will disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2021-23: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2019-20: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2021-23: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2019-20: Asset quality likely to deteriorate on the back of financial market turmoil in 2018. Central Bank of Turkey to lower rates gradually as inflation moderates in 2019. Risk of the US imposing fines or sanctions on some Turkish banks.
2021-23: Lending growth to pick up again as banking system regains strength. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2019-20: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2021-23: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2019-20: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2021-23: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2021-23: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

a Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election a presidential system of government was introduced and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and tightening global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows and slow the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current-account deficit of US$47.4bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrained freedom of speech and freedom of association. Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote after a high turnout. Results published by opposition observers were similar to those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers-including the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to restrict political dissent and stifle the opposition. Despite allowing the state of emergency to expire on July 18th, parliament passed a security law on July 25th that imposes stringent barriers on freedoms. These are similar to those of the state of emergency, which was introduced after the attempted coup in a bid to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies who include the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the Turkish government of masterminding the coup plot.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, which increased the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in south-east Turkey. The formation of a governing coalition between the AKP and the MHP will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. The MHP will advocate the repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
On June 24th parliamentary and presidential elections were held, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote with a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP), as the HDP managed to poll more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament.
Local elections are planned in March 2019. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in the mood for an election until next year. The AKP and the MHP look unlikely to co-operate in the local elections after disagreements regarding the selection process for mayoral candidates in large cities.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; Turkey's forging of closer relations with China, Russia and Iran; tensions with Cyprus over the delimitation of the two countries' exclusive economic zones in the Mediterranean; and US sanctions on Turkish government officials due to Turkey's detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor, on terrorist charges (sanctions were lifted in November after Mr Brunson was released in October).
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional rather than strategic. However, we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a breakdown in relations. Turkey and the EU have a common interest in handling refugee inflows from Syria and Iraq; the fact that Mr Erdogan visited Germany in late September lends credence to this view. However, EU-Turkey relations would deteriorate quickly if the EU suspended Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, or if Turkey re-imposed the death penalty, closed the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdrew from NATO (none of these options are part of our core forecast).
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Turkey-Russia relations reached a low point following Turkey's downing of a Russian fighter jet in November 2015; bilateral ties have improved in the past two years, but the level of trust between the two countries remains low. In October Turkey and Russia finalised the creation of a jointly patrolled demilitarised zone in Idlib, the last rebel-held governorate in northern Syria. However, this does not alter our view that they are co-operating in Syria while pursuing contrasting goals (Russia backs the government led by Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, whereas Turkey provides support to rebels).
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business, and investment, climate. Nonetheless, Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised banking sector, and its dynamic and diversified private sector.
In the aftermath of the failed coup in July 2016 a highly accommodative policy stance has exacerbated fiscal and external imbalances. This, together with heightened political uncertainty, the tightening of global liquidity conditions and tensions with the US, led to a currency crisis in August 2018. The heavily pro-growth approach to economic policymaking that Mr Erdogan has espoused enthusiastically over the past decade will remain a predominant feature over our forecast period (2019-23), at the expense of inflation control and fiscal discipline. This approach will continue to have an important effect on, for example, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, public-private capital investments and social spending. Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches (a major factor behind the high unemployment rate) and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed in 2019-23, as propping up economic growth-partly to avoid social unrest-will remain the priority.
In the case of a severe economic or banking crisis (not our core forecast), Turkey's options will remain limited, as Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries appear unwilling to offer financial support. This is because Turkey is forging closer ties with Iran, a country with which Saudi Arabia is at odds. In addition, Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia deteriorated (from an already low base) after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in October. Meanwhile an IMF programme would include what the government would regard as an unacceptable conditionality and would run counter to Mr Erdogan's nationalist, anti-Western rhetoric. Finally, there is little prospect of EU financial assistance, not least because there would be no consensus on this issue among EU member states. Only China, therefore, appears able at present to offer a financial lifeline to Turkey. Such assistance could come as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to boost transport infrastructure between Asia and Europe to foster trade and connectivity in the coming decades.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The public finances have traditionally been one of the Turkish economy's most reassuring aspects. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Despite a series of tax rises this year and official promises of budgetary tightening, higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen in 2018, to 1.9% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2017. We subsequently expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy, which, alongside a recovering economy, will lead the deficit to contract gradually in the second half of our forecast period, to 1.5% of GDP in 2023.
We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to have remained broadly stable, at 27.9% of GDP at end-2018 (from 28.3% at end-2017), despite economic turmoil following the August currency crisis and various government handouts to parts of the population ahead of the June election. The ratio will decline slightly, to 25.2% by the end of 2023, as macroeconomic conditions normalise and the budget deficit shrinks.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
On September 13th the Central Bank of Turkey's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its main policy rate, the one-week repo (repurchase agreement) lending rate, to 24%, from 17.75% previously. The MPC's decision represented a response to the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August, as well as to the record rise in annual consumer price inflation. The average cost of central bank funding is likely to be above the main policy rate, however. The bank retains the option of providing some of its funding for the banking system at its overnight lending rates, which are 1.5-3% higher than the one-week repo rate.
We expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2018. In 2019-20 the central bank will gradually lower its policy rate in response to declining inflationary pressures and a normalisation of financial market conditions. In 2021-23 we believe that it will miss its inflation target of 5%. This reflects the government's continued pro-growth stance; it will put pressure on the bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to lower inflation to the 5% target.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. However, the surge in economic growth has exacerbated internal and external imbalances. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredictability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short-term capital inflows, a rising interest rate environment in advanced economies and a diplomatic spat with the US-have contributed to the lira losing about 40% of its value against the US dollar in January-August, before it started to recover in September. The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dent the economic outlook.
High-frequency indicators for September (latest available data) suggest that the economy is decelerating in the wake of the currency crisis. After mild growth in the second quarter (5.7% year on year, down from 7.3% in full-year 2017), we expect the economy to contract on a quarterly basis in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, and in January-March 2019. There are substantial downside risks to this forecast; this growth profile does not reflect the possible impact of a severe banking crisis (not our core scenario), although we expect non-performing loans to rise and credit availability to be impaired in the coming quarters.
We believe that full-year growth will decelerate to 3.1% in 2018 and that GDP will grow only slightly in 2019, by 1%, mainly owing to base effects. In 2020 we expect full-year growth to rebound to 4.9% as the economy recovers and spare capacity is depleted. In 2021-23 economic growth will average 4%, broadly in line with the economy's forecast potential growth rate.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Even before the lira's collapse against the US dollar in August, inflation was already stubbornly high and well above the central bank's official 5% medium-term target; it averaged 11.1% in 2017. This year the currency crisis and rising global commodity prices have driven inflation higher, to a peak of 25.3% year on year in October (inflation started to decelerate in November, at 21.6% year on year). This will push inflation to an average of 16.8% this year (from 11.1% in 2017).
In 2019 inflation will remain elevated in the first half of the year and then moderate gradually on the back of a broadly stable lira (against the US dollar), an only limited increase in global oil prices and the emergence of spare capacity in the economy. On average, we forecast inflation of 16.6% in 2019-only marginally below the 2018 rate.
The moderating trend in inflation will continue in 2020, with an average inflation rate of 9.1%, as global oil prices decline owing to a slowdown in the US economy and the exchange rate depreciates only slightly (in nominal terms) against the US dollar. In 2021-23 we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of 7.3%-still above the central bank's medium-term target of 5%. Economic growth in these years will be close to the economy's potential growth rate (limiting upward inflationary pressures).
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
In 2017 the lira depreciated by an average of almost 18% against the US dollar. In 2018 we estimate a further average depreciation, of about 25% (in nominal terms) in the full year. The lira depreciated significantly in January-August, with the exchange rate briefly reaching TL7.2:US$1 on August 13th. After a substantial recovery from September, we expect the lira to remain broadly stable against the US dollar in the remainder of the year. This expectation is underpinned by our view that the decrease in tensions between the US and Turkey, the sharp reduction in the current-account deficit due to the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar, and the tight monetary policy stance will contribute to a stabilisation of the exchange rate in the near term.
In 2019 we forecast that the lira will continue to depreciate on average against the US dollar, albeit at a much more moderate pace than in 2018. A normalising economic and financial domestic situation will support the exchange rate. However, there will be an increase in global risk aversion as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war are fully felt, the cooling of the global economy causes expectations of a recession in some advanced economies to build and central banks in advanced economies tighten their monetary policy stances. As a result, we expect an average exchange rate of TL5.7:US$1 in 2019. Risks surrounding our exchange-rate forecast for 2019 are tilted to the upside.
In 2020 we expect the exchange rate to remain broadly stable as the economy starts to grow more markedly after an expected slump in 2018-19. Thereafter in 2021-23 we expect a gradual depreciation of the lira against the US dollar in nominal terms, to TL6.3:US$1 by the end of 2023.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The current-account deficit as a share of GDP will narrow in 2018, to 4.6%, from 5.6% in 2017, as the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar will depress imports (owing to a deceleration in domestic demand) and boost export competitiveness. In 2019-23 we expect a smaller average annual current-account deficit, of 3.6% of GDP. Significant gains in competitiveness from past lira depreciation, which moderated inflation, and the emergence of spare capacity will result in a boost to exports and a compression in imports over the medium term.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. [...]we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. [...]we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period. Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%, but exchange controls remain.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, have put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed administration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,500% at the end of 2017 and will reach 715,130% by end-2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2019-23, the worst position in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of roll-back of interventionist measures like price controls, but political-instability concerns slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt at attracting investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque but restrictions on the private sector's access to foreign currency remain in place.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns about economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. The current freeze on redundancies is fazed-out
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The VAT rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 2.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Despite an extremely severe economic crisis, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. Regardless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition to a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-at some point in the forecast period. Currently, we assume that this will happen in 2019, but the process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect the forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
The opposition, owing to internal infighting and years of government harassment, is in disarray and incapable of channelling the populace's dissatisfaction. The regime has been pushing for a new dialogue, widening longstanding rifts in the opposition on how to best oppose the regime and force political change.
The opposition's troubles notwithstanding, the PSUV is dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen with military or political connections. This network is sustained by opportunities for corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls, subsidised imports, clientelism, control of wasteful state-owned companies and the government's tacit approval of transnational organised crime (as evidenced by numerous press reports, and sanctions and indictments related to drug-trafficking on regime leaders abroad).
Regime factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, resulting in different civic-military factions coexisting within the regime. Outside of potential outright criminal income, the resources maintaining this patronage system come from export revenue generated by PDVSA, the state-owned oil company.
Mismanagement and underinvestment at PDVSA has led to declining output and exports, destabilising the regime. Purges of the military and re-organisations in civilian government are common as factions jostle for power. A reshuffle in the judiciary and the national intelligence agency in October seems to have strengthened Mr Maduro, to the detriment of his main internal rival, Diosdado Cabello, head of the Constituent Assembly (ANC), the country's de facto legislature. With resources dwindling, control of the coercive apparatus is key to maintaining regime cohesion. Mr Maduro has thus seemingly increased his capacity to wrangle the regime's competing factions.
However, our baseline view is that the government's proven inability to increase PDVSA output or secure sufficient financing makes the status-quo unsustainable. This process may be hastened if exports are disrupted by external forces, such as US government sanctions on the oil trade (the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market and a key source of production inputs) or asset seizures stemming from unpaid debts. With oil output dropping to around 1m barrels/day (b/d), down from 2.5m b/d when Mr Maduro took office, we currently expect an internal fracture in 2019 but, regardless of the timing, what happens next is hard to predict.
Given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would take priority under a new government. We expect regime pragmatists to seek assistance from Western governments and multilateral organisations. To gain international legitimacy and secure financing, these pragmatists would allow nominal opposition participation in a "mixed administration". Given past behaviour, there should be plenty of opposition figures willing to participate. This administration would still face pockets of resistance in places such as the judiciary, the ANC and the radicalised supporters of the PSUV known as colectivos. As such, political stability through the forecast period will be limited.
Three key assumptions underpin our baseline view. A crucial assumption is that, given economic conditions, Mr Maduro cannot sustain regime cohesion indefinitely. Changes at the national intelligence agency introduces risks to this assumption. A second assumption is that Russia and China-erstwhile financiers-will not provide substantial funding to the current administration (or to a PSUV-only successor administration). We base this view on the regime's inability to repay already expired loans and the fact that it has received limited Chinese or Russian aid since 2015. Venezuela's oil wealth, however, remains a draw-especially if sold off at low prices by a bankrupt regime.
A significant third assumption is that the need to restore macroeconomic stability and steady resource flows through the patronage system has become so urgent as to allow pragmatists to accept Western-demanded democratic and macroeconomic reforms. Democratic reform would be likely to involve judicial retribution on a number of current regime leaders, while macroeconomic reform would eliminate the economy's distortions, closing avenues for corruption and enrichment.
As such, there are strong risks to our baseline view, and there is a strong possibility of alternate scenarios. These include: a PSUV-only administration securing enough Chinese financing; a permanently impoverished nation led by an outright military government (or one with civilian figureheads); or-as an outside possibility-prolonged chaos, if regime cohesion fails but no faction gains clear control of the state apparatus across the country.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Municipal elections are scheduled for December 9th. Most of the opposition has been proscribed and only some parties are participating (which has led to further infighting). In this context, a PSUV sweep is all but guaranteed. Based on our political assumptions, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing would almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The US has put individual sanctions on most regime leaders, including potential successors to Mr Maduro. This limits the field of negotiating partners in the event of an internal fracture of the regime, but sanctions are reversible. US country-level sanctions block Venezuela from refinancing its debts. Military intervention and sanctions banning the oil trade are not part of our baseline assumption, but a hawkish US foreign policy team increases risks.
Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and PDVSA. The regime openly courts the two countries, but with little apparent success. A change in the current Chinese stance represents a major risk to our forecast.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Monetisation of large public deficits, coupled with mismanagement of the state-dominated oil industry, has led to hyperinflation and shortages of foreign currency, basic goods and industrial inputs. The government remains technically unable and politically unwilling to undertake the deep and wide-ranging policy and institutional changes needed. Its latest economic plan, launched in late August, was self-defeating, and the government has not complied with a cornerstone promise to abolish the monetisation of public deficits. As such, imbalances will persist and foreign exchange will continue to be rationed.
Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that underpins our baseline forecast for political change. Furthermore, outside of promising a hard-to-implement reduction in fuel subsidies, the plan had little focus on PDVSA's falling output; production at PDVSA remains a crucial factor in supporting the economy amid a collapse in the non-oil sector.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies will be implemented under a new government. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new regime, and whether this takes precedence over the likely demands for reform from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV is a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members. These members would oppose international assistance, foreign investment and policy reforms on both ideological and personal grounds (as many regime insiders profit from the state's indirect and direct control of the economy).
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. Thus, we expect limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will restrict economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We estimate that the fiscal deficit is well into double figures as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency.
High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities. Most sovereign and state-owned bonds (including PDVSA's) are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy changes or a change in leadership. The exceptions to arrears are debts that threaten Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) and leased facilities in the Caribbean. Both facilitate PDVSA's capacity to export oil and import production inputs. So far, Venezuela has taken a defensive stance, treating each claim individually and stalling as much as possible before complying when seizures seem imminent. Given PDVSA's strained financial situation and the lack of further sources of financing, the strategy does not seem sustainable.
Citgo, itself indebted and posted as collateral for loans and bonds, could have its fate be resolved by a prolonged judicial process in the US. We believe that, if forced to choose, the government would prioritise its Caribbean assets over Citgo, as the former are key for PDVSA's capacity to export, while import-export trade with Citgo could be re-routed to other US companies. However, it is unclear when the government may have to choose or if would have the capacity to do so. PDVSA's strained financial situation means that the risk of default and seizure will remain high in the short term. Stalling tactics (including partial compliance with payments) will continue.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the complete removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; the deficit will be substantial throughout the 2019-23 period.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. Money supply (M2) continues to grow rapidly, expanding by 96% month on month at end-November. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 15% in 2018, we expect further contractions in 2019-20. A forecast recovery in 2021-23 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of around 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also contract, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment.
We expect oil output to bottom out at 1m b/d in mid-2019, kept from going lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from 2019, production will start to recover in the second half of 2020 but will remain well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017, even at the end of our forecast period.
Export volumes will only start to recover in 2020, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Decimated domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly estimated that monthly inflation was 148% (833,997% year on year) in October. In the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan in 2019, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our current baseline forecast, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) amid deep imbalances and as a means to try to tackle hyperinflation is possible in 2019. The exact nature and implementation of such moves are hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 99%, but exchange controls remain. The official rate is determined by an auction process, but the government-which monopolises the country's exports-does not supply the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible. In early December the black-market exchange rate was around BsS500:US$1; the official rate stood at BsS152:US$1.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
After an estimated current-account surplus of US$14.3bn in 2018, we expect the current account to remain in surplus for most of the forecast period. The surplus is buoyed by non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2018 alone). Our export data, which are based on IMF data, may overstate receipts, as some exports are actually payments in-kind for loans, the repayment of which may not be included in their totality under forecast interest repayments (we have excluded repayments to Chinese lenders to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on which our debt forecasts are based).
By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored. Although we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, we also expect a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been decimated and imports have been compressed to artificially low levels. In addition, the government will be complying with its debt obligations, meaning that the restructured debt will actually result in increased outflows in interest payments. These factors will erode the current-account surplus from 4.8% of GDP in 2020 to a deficit of 1.2% by 2023.
We currently expect that the new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming the installation of a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on substantial finance from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-23, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

World Commodity Forecasts Food Feedstuffs and Beverages November 2018

https://www.proquest.com/reports/world-commodity-forecasts-food-feedstuffs/docview/2135681283/se-2?accountid=14357

Abstract: [...]uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. [...]exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19, especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. Palm oil prices are forecast to follow a similar trend as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth, particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Cocoa (US cents/lb) 138.9 142.2 131.1 92.1 103.2 96.4 100.6 92.0 94.0 96.0 Coffee (Arabica) (US cents/lb) 200.7 159.9 163.8 150.7 130.5 139.3 155.8 170.0 175.0 172.0 Coffee (Robusta) (US cents/lb) 100.5 88.1 88.6 100.9 84.3 90.0 102.8 100.0 103.5 101.5 Tea (US$/kg) 2.72 2.78 2.68 3.15 2.88 2.81 2.90 2.85 2.92 2.95 Sugar (US cents/lb) 17.0 13.4 18.1 16.0 11.8 10.8 11.3 11.4 11.4 11.3 Barley (US$/tonne) 146.1 127.9 129.4 138.5 159.8 164.6 169.5 153.9 161.8 163.8 Maize (US$/tonne) 206.0 175.5 168.3 160.9 173.3 172.5 185.0 188.0 192.0 195.0 Rice (US$/tonne) 423.8 386.0 386.0 389.8 405.0 411.3 416.3 430.0 427.0 428.0 Sorghum (US$/tonne) 909.3 682.6 734.2 786.1 907.0 933.9 961.7 873.5 918.1 929.2 Wheat (US$/tonne) 302.7 232.5 197.5 211.5 244.0 251.3 258.8 235.0 247.0 250.0 Soybeans (US$/tonne) 501.3 379.8 389.8 377.0 360.6 336.3 345.0 388.0 402.0 410.0 Soybean oil (US$/tonne) 909.3 682.6 734.2 757.6 700.0 677.0 694.6 781.2 781.2 781.2 Soymeal (US$/tonne) 527.9 398.7 380.6 358.8 414.0 415.7 416.2 468.1 468.1 468.1 Palm oil (US$/tonne) 821.4 559.4 639.1 649.1 583.9 563.1 588.7 587.0 580.0 582.0 Rapeseed oil (US$/tonne) 907.3 775.3 823.6 869.5 835.8 888.5 890.7 960.0 970.0 975.0 Sunflowerseed oil (US$/tonne) 901.8 845.8 840.9 795.7 747.4 734.5 813.5 875.0 903.0 913.0 Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.

Agricultural prices made a fairly modest recovery in 2018
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects its food, feedstuffs and beverages (FFB) price index to rise by 2.1% in 2018, down from our previous estimate of 2.8% owing to weaker prices for beverages such as coffee and cocoa, as well as sugar. The bilateral trade war between the US and China has disrupted existing trade patterns and caused the prices of some products that are subject to tariffs, including soybeans and soymeal, to diverge in various markets. A number of other markets, including grains such as rice and maize, are also beginning to tighten slightly, which will support sustained price growth through to 2020. Nonetheless, supplies in most markets remain comfortable by historical standards. Several crops registered record harvests in 2016/17, including wheat and soybeans, and large carryover stocks will limit the potential for price growth in 2018. Downside risks related to a potentially disruptive El Niño event will persist, but we do not forecast an agricultural price shock. FFB prices are forecast to remain flat in 2019 as the effects of the US-China bilateral trade war start to impact markets. However, by 2020 we expect producers and consumers to have adapted to shifting supply chains, supporting 4.9% growth in the FFB index owing to strong price growth in beverages, sugar and grains. Overall, we expect rising populations and incomes to continue to support modest growth in demand (and therefore prices) in the FFB sector in the medium and long term.
FFB prices will rise again in 2020, and risks to the forecast remain mixed
Nonetheless, the road ahead will be bumpy. Agricultural markets have been well supplied for several consecutive seasons, providing ample stocks to draw on. We expect global GDP growth to remain relatively firm, at an average of 2.6% per year in 2019-20. However, uncertainty surrounding tightening monetary policy in major developed markets, including the US, the risk of a disorderly economic slowdown in China (which is not our core forecast) and the impact of increasingly protectionist trade policies espoused by the US president, Donald Trump, continue to pose risks to our forecast. In addition, exchange-rate trends may help to keep a lid on global commodity prices. Since April the US dollar has rallied strongly against other major currencies, and we expect the dollar (in which most raw materials are traded) to continue to remain fairly strong against most emerging-market currencies in 2018-19, especially as the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso in recent weeks sparks concerns over potential contagion in other emerging markets. This will weigh on import demand in many emerging markets and encourage exporters to increase output, further contributing to global supplies.
Grain prices registered strong gains in 2018
We estimate that grain prices will rise by 12.6% in 2018. Maize prices rose by about 10% on average in February in response to worries about drought and rapidly shrinking production prospects in Argentina. We estimate full-year maize price growth to average 7.7% in 2018, as new crops arrive on the market and carryover supplies from the bumper 2016/17 crop remain available. Global wheat production is expected to fall by 5.8% owing to adverse weather conditions. Major wheat producers such as the EU, China, the US and Australia are expected to register lower than average harvests. As global demand remains strong, the wheat market is likely to register a deficit in 2017/18. This will help to boost wheat prices by 15.4% year on year in 2018 (from 17% previously) and by a further 3% in 2019 (from 2% previously).
Oilseed prices will fall in 2019-20
Oilseed prices are estimated to fall by 1.3% in 2018 after a decline of 2% in 2017, largely as a result of bumper soybean crops in major producers such as the US and Brazil. Despite strong global demand, this has driven global soybean stockpiles higher. We expect soybean prices to decline by an average of 2.1% per year in 2019-20. While China's imposition in July of a 25% tariff on soybean imports from the US has created the potential for greater price volatility, we expect China to source imports from other suppliers, avoiding a sharp increase in prices for now. Sunflowerseed oil prices are likely to continue to weaken in 2019, reflecting comfortable supplies. Palm oil prices are forecast to follow a similar trend as global output surges and changing consumer habits result in lower demand growth, particularly in developed economies, where health concerns have caused consumers to opt for alternative products.
A forecast recovery in coffee prices in 2019 will lift the beverages sub-index
We estimate that the beverages sub-index, which includes coffee, cocoa and tea, will fall for the sixth consecutive year in 2018. We expect cocoa prices to rise by 12.1% in 2018 before declining by around 6.6% in 2019, although the gain in 2018 will do little to erase the massive drop of nearly 30% in 2017, which was caused by soaring global production and fairly weak demand growth. Global coffee prices (arabica) are forecast to fall by 13.4% in 2018 on the back of higher than expected production from Central America as well as the comparative strength of the US dollar, which will encourage exporters to sell their stocks. In 2019 we expect prices of higher-value arabica coffee beans to rebound by 6.7%, as several consecutive years of market deficits begin to erode global supplies.
Sugar prices will recover in 2020
Sugar prices are expected to decline by around 26.1% in 2018, following a decline of 11.3% in 2017. This reflects crop-friendly weather conditions in key producer markets, which are fuelling expectations of a larger global sugar surplus than we had previously anticipated. Policy moves to restrict import dependence in key consumers (notably China, India and the EU) have weakened market sentiment further. This decline will continue in 2019, but we expect supplies to begin to tighten in 2020 as higher ethanol prices encourage farmers to divert more cane to ethanol (rather than to its rival, sugar). This should support growth in global sugar prices of 4.6% year on year in 2020.

Cocoa
Demand
After expanding by an estimated 1.5% in the 2017/18 season (October-September), global cocoa consumption growth is forecast to slow during 2018/19-2019/20. Although cocoa consumption in the world's largest consumers-mainly developed economies and some large markets in the developing world-is forecast to remain positive, consumption growth will remain weak in many of these countries, at less than 1%. Demand growth will prove stronger in other, smaller cocoa consumers, but these markets will not be sufficiently large to drive stronger overall growth in global cocoa consumption. By region, Asia accounts for much of the increase in global demand, although rising demand in the Americas and Europe will also contribute to overall demand growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global cocoa demand growth will average 1.3% per year in 2018/19 and 2019/20. Already high per-capita consumption levels in major developed markets will prevent faster demand growth. Another factor precluding more rapid demand growth are retail prices, which may rise in response to the increase in global cocoa prices in recent months, potentially pushing some consumers towards non-chocolate confectionery. Meanwhile, the size of many chocolate bars has shrunk-partly in response to consumer concerns about obesity but also to protect profits against a background of rising cocoa prices in previous years-which will also hamper consumption growth.
Balancing demand between cocoa powder and butter will be challenging
Asian countries will see slightly faster growth in cocoa demand than the global average, as these markets are far less saturated and GDP growth will remain higher than in developed economies. Stronger demand in Asia will have implications for global demand for cocoa butter (used in richer products, such as chocolate confectionery) and cocoa powder (used to add chocolate flavour to products such as biscuits, cakes and drinks). The demand balance between cocoa powder and butter is both delicate and cyclical. We expect demand for cocoa butter to remain strong in the short term, but it will not outstrip demand for powder indefinitely. Given that Asia accounted for 27% of the world's imports of cocoa powder in 2016/17, compared with just 11% of global imports of cocoa butter, firmer consumption growth in that market is likely to lift demand for powder.
Consumption growth will remain fairly low in more saturated markets
We forecast modest but positive growth in demand for cocoa in developed markets in 2018/19-2019/20. Health concerns, market saturation and changing retail habits will constrain demand (the rise of internet grocery shopping is eroding spur-of-the-moment in-store chocolate purchases). However, rising demand for dark chocolate-which has a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate and is perceived to be healthier-will support overall consumption. Consumers in the US (the largest cocoa-consuming country, which accounts for 18% of global demand) and in European countries, which collectively account for 46% of global demand, are showing an increasing preference for premium chocolate with a higher cocoa content, but with less frequent purchases. However, somewhat weaker underlying economic conditions will contribute to a gradual deceleration in cocoa consumption in many of these markets over the course of2018/19-2019/20.
Cocoa consumption growth will remain firm in Asia
China and India have huge potential for further expansion in cocoa demand, given currently low per-head consumption levels of just 35 g in India and 62 g in China in 2016/17, compared with 2-6 kg in developed markets. However, demand growth will be constrained by high retail prices. Chinese demand will continue to rise firmly, at a rate of around 5.1% per year in 2018/19-2019/20 on the back of a relatively firm GDP growth forecast. In India, we expect demand growth to pick up from an estimated 2.1% in 2017/18 to an annual average of 3.1% per year during the forecast period.

Supply
After falling by an estimated 3% in 2017/18, prospects for global cocoa production are weak for the 2018/19-2019/20 forecast period, reflecting a projected drop in production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively the world's largest and second-largest cocoa producers. Although output in both countries will remain high by historical standards, relatively unsupportive domestic policy frameworks and weaker confidence among growers will drag down cocoa output. Notwithstanding a rise in prices in 2018, the previous long-running period of weak prices is likely to have dissuaded farmers from investing in fertiliser and pesticides, raising the incidence of crop disease and contributing to the broader decline in global cocoa production. Rising production in other Asian and Latin America producers will fail to offset the decline in cocoa output among several of the largest African producers.
Structural and geographical factors will hamper long-term supply
Longer-term structural problems will also constrain supply. Not only have farm-gate prices in several large producing countries begun to fall in line with lower market prices for cocoa, but farmers are also getting a much smaller share of the final retail price than in previous decades owing to higher costs further down the supply chain. In West Africa, for example, many farmers remain below the poverty line, and as a result few young people are choosing to work in the cocoa sector. Governments are trying to lift farmers' incomes to attract new workers, but it is uncertain how effective this will be in the long term.
Geographical considerations will also hamper the diversification of production. Cocoa can only be grown in certain regions (three-quarters of world production comes from regions that are located within eight degrees of the equator) under warm and humid conditions. Cocoa production is therefore likely to remain concentrated among a small group of countries, limiting the scope for strong and sustained output growth. Periodically, there is speculation that climate change will hamper production in these countries to such an extent that cocoa production will plummet. However, we believe that some countries have significant potential to expand production, mainly in Latin America, where high-quality cocoa is produced. The expansion of grinding facilities in producing countries may also encourage new investment to lift output.
Côte d'Ivoire's production is set to drop in 2018/19 and 2019/20
In Côte d'Ivoire, we estimate that cocoa output fell by 3.5% in 2017/18, partly as a result of dry weather, which affected the mid-year-crop. We are forecasting production to fall again in 2018/19, but by just 3.1% (an upward revision from last month's projected 5.1% drop), with overall production remaining extremely high in the context of the 27.8% jump in output in 2016/17 to record levels. Weather prospects at the start of the 2018/19 crop season are fairly positive, and farmers have voiced optimism about expected production trends during the October-March main crop. A 7.1% increase in farm-gate prices by the Conseil du Café-Cacao (CCC) will also prove supportive, even though prices remain lower than in neighbouring Ghana (which will sustain problems of smuggling across the border). Despite these supporting factors, our baseline forecast for a drop in cocoa production in 2018/19, followed by another contraction of 2.1% in 2019/20, reflects several downside factors. Plans to accelerate the replacement of old crops infected by swollen shoot virus with new crops over the course of the next three years will hamper production. In addition, there have been reports of reduced use of fertiliser and pesticides over the past year, with the incidence of crop disease rising as a result. A stabilisation fund is supposed to protect farmers' revenue from price volatility, but the amounts have been insufficient, and given the lack of transparency over the financial reserves held by the CCC, neither farmers nor exporters are confident that losses arising from low global prices in 2016/17 will be recouped.
Ghanaian production is set to decline in both 2018/19 and 2019/20
Similar production trends are evident in Ghana. Adverse weather and a difficult policy backdrop hampered production in 2017/18, with cocoa output declining by an estimated 10.3%. We are forecasting a continued, albeit gentler, contraction in 2018/19 and 2019/20. The cocoa authority, Cocobod, is encountering financial problems that are affecting the amount paid to farmers, with farm-gate prices on hold in 2018/19, which in turn will depress output. Cocobod was forced to seek a bridging loan from the Bank of Ghana (the central bank) last year, and following the recent depletion of its stabilisation fund and continued reliance on debt financing, Cocobod has announced that it is considering amending the way in which farmers are paid. This is likely to involve the removal of a scheme that pays subsidies to farmers (guaranteeing a minimum income level). The authorities are instead considering a scheme in which farmers are paid 70% of the cocoa export price, which would expose incomes to considerable market volatility. Given anxiety among farmers about the government's intention to prioritise other crops over cocoa, the ongoing encroachment by gold miners, the government's decision to stop providing free fertiliser and the fact that around one-fifth of trees are affected by swollen shoot disease, production is forecast to fall by 5.2% in 2018/19 and by 3% in 2019/20.
In the longer term, the New Patriotic Party government plans to rehabilitate cocoa farms, cutting down trees that are over 30 years old and replanting them while providing financial compensation to farmers until the trees start yielding fruit (generally 3-5 years). The authorities aim ultimately to raise production significantly, with Cocobod recently indicating that it is targeting output of 1m tonnes within the next five years (an apparent downgrade from previous statements citing a target of 1.5m tonnes within four years), driven by better soil management, pest and disease control and improved irrigation. These plans are positive, since Ghana has a large share of unproductive trees (estimated at 40% by Cocobod) and consequently a low average yield per hectare (at 400 kg/ha, compared with 600 kg/ha in Côte d'Ivoire and 1 tonne/ha in Indonesia). However, it will be difficult to secure the necessary funding. We think it is unlikely that these ambitious plans will come to fruition, since the weak macroeconomic backdrop is likely to hamper public investment and external creditors are unlikely to fund the project.
The production targets of Cameroon and Nigeria will prove overambitious
Cameroon's cocoa production is estimated to have moderated in 2017/18 by 8.5% as political unrest in the south-west of the country, which produces around half of the country's output, dragged down national production, with rising numbers of farmers fleeing their plantations in the wake of violent clashes between separatists and the security forces. We have downgraded our forecasts this month and now expect a continued drop in cocoa output by 11.1% in 2018/19, on the basis that continued domestic political instability will impinge on cocoa production. Although we are forecasting a robust recovery in 2019/20 by 10%, overall production levels will remain weak owing to two years of consecutive declines. Cuts in farm-gate prices will be a disincentive to farmers, meaning that the government will remain significantly off track from its 2020 production target of 600,000 tonnes-a level that even the national Cocoa Development Corporation has described as "unrealistic and unattainable". Plans to increase the harvested area by 100,000 ha each year are highly unlikely to materialise in the context of the recent political instability.
Cocoa production in Nigeria has recovered in recent years after a slump in 2014-16, rising by an estimated 4.1% in 2017/18 to 255,000 tonnes (still below the government target of 300,000-320,000 tonnes). The authorities are seeking investment to raise cocoa production with the aim of diversifying and expanding sources of foreign-exchange earnings beyond the mainstay of oil, with the Ministry of Agriculture recently stating that it believes Nigeria can boost cocoa production above the levels recorded in Côte d'Ivoire. However, we remain pessimistic about production prospects and are forecasting a contraction of 0.9% on average per year in 2018/19-2019/20. Government initiatives meant to support farmers-including efforts to introduce high-yielding cocoa and to increase the distribution of free seedlings-have not been successful. In addition, investment has been slow to materialise, and reports of an increase in fungal disease as a result of recent heavy rains will hamper production in the near term. Structural problems, such as weak infrastructure, corruption, poor and expensive access to financing and weak implementation, remain unaddressed and will prevent a significant increase in output. We are forecasting a 3.9% contraction in cocoa output in 2018/19, followed by a partial 2% recovery in 20219/20.
Production will continue to recover in Indonesia
Indonesia is among the few major cocoa producers that are likely to see output rising firmly during the forecast period. Stable weather conditions in 2017/18 are likely to have lifted cocoa output by an estimated 7.4%. We forecast continued growth of 5.1% during the forecast period, but at 320,000 tonnes in 2019/20 output levels will remain weak by historical standards. The authorities have ambitious plans to triple cocoa output by 2020, from 325,000 tonnes in 2014/15, but these targets are highly unlikely to materialise. Indonesian firms will probably rely increasingly on imported processed cocoa from nearby Malaysia to meet domestic demand.
Strong potential for growth in Latin America
Structurally, there is scope for both of Latin America's two largest cocoa producers, Brazil and Ecuador, to lift output as manufacturers look to develop production centres outside West Africa. The region's reputation for producing high-quality cocoa will help in this respect, given rising global demand for premium chocolate. Although some of this investment will be slow to materialise, we still expect annual average output growth of 3.5% in Ecuador and 4.9% in Brazil during 2018/19-2019/20.

We expect the surplus in the global cocoa market to narrow sharply, from an estimated 402,000 tonnes in 2017/18 to 147,000 tonnes in 2019/20. Although production is forecast to fall steadily, the fact that it will do so from such a high base (output was exceptionally strong in 2016/17) means that we continue to forecast a market surplus, despite signs of continued (albeit weaker) demand growth. Stocks are forecast to reach 2.5m tonnes at the end of the 2019/20 season. Although this is high by historical standards, the relatively gloomy production outlook is likely to bolster prices towards the end of the forecast period.

Market surplus will put downward pressure on prices in 2019
Cocoa prices traded at comparatively low levels between February 2017 and February 2018, mainly in the range of US$1,950/tonne and US$2,050/tonne. However, prices rose sharply in March-May, to US$2,600-2,700/tonne, on the back of gloomy prospects for production in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Better weather conditions subsequently led to a reduction in prices to around US$2,050/tonne in early October. However, firmer prices earlier in the year mean that our full-year average price estimate, at US$2,275/tonne, implies a 12.1% year on year increase.
Despite falling production in 2019, weaker demand and a persistent market surplus will suppress prices, which are forecast to average US$2,126/tonne, marking a decline of 6.5% year on year. The cocoa authorities in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana have indicated that they plan to work together in an attempt to lift cocoa prices next year, but our baseline assumption is that this will have a very limited impact (if any) on global cocoa prices, not least because farm-gate prices remain different in each country. Although the same supply-demand factors will remain in play in 2020, amid declining production and weaker demand growth investor concerns about the impact of several years of falling output will place some support under prices, which we expect to pick up to around US$2,300/tonne by the last quarter of 2020.

Coffee
Demand
Global coffee consumption has been accelerating moderately in recent years, growing by an estimated 3.1% in the 2017/18 crop year (October-September), largely boosted by rising consumption in coffee-importing countries-mainly developed economies, which account for two-thirds of global demand. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects growth in global coffee demand to decelerate to 2.6% in 2018/19 and 1.9% in 2019/20, mainly reflecting less supportive underlying economic conditions. Continued monetary policy tightening in some of the large coffee consumers will affect overall domestic demand, although with the policy stance remaining relatively loose and most economies decelerating rather than entering into a recession, coffee consumption will rise more steadily.
In coffee-exporting countries, many of which are emerging markets, consumption growth will be lower, averaging 2.3% per year in 2018/19-2019/20. Tepid demand growth in Brazil, which currently accounts for around 40% of exporting countries' consumption owing to the sheer size of its domestic market, is the main factor contributing to weak overall growth in coffee consumption among coffee exporters. Consumption growth will be strongest in Asia-notably China, whose economy will continue to grow firmly. However, per-capita coffee consumption levels are low in China, so even as domestic demand rises quickly, this will contribute only modestly to global growth (China will account for only 3% of the total global rise in coffee production in 2017/18-2018/19).
Coffee habits are shifting around the world
Consumption trends will change in both the home and out-of-home sectors. In the latter, the expansion of coffee-shop chains will continue, providing a boost to demand, particularly in North America (with 46% of coffee in the US now consumed out of the home) and Europe (which saw the number of coffee shops rise by 6.4% in 2017), but store formats will evolve. Increasing demand for "on the go" beverages will result in larger numbers of smaller shops, including within petrol stations and supermarkets, as well as the spread of coffee delivery services by large chains. In some markets-including the US and China-both large coffee chains and new start-ups are increasingly focusing on prepayment through smartphone apps, allowing customers to pick up their purchases without having to queue. These technological developments are likely to help the out-of-home sector to defend its market share at a time when a large number of consumers have single-serve coffee-capsule machines at home. This will be accompanied by the heavy marketing of other coffee beverages, including iced coffee and cold brew. Although accounting for only a small share of the out-of-home segment, sales of these products are likely to grow rapidly.
Single-serve coffee will help to drive growth in developed markets
Demand for coffee at home that rivals the quality of beverages found in cafes will result in a shift away from the consumption of instant coffee. On a global level, coffee-pod sales are approaching the total combined value of instant and ground coffee, although the higher cost of pods means that in volume terms the instant- and ground-coffee market remains larger. Despite the sharp slowdown in sales of machines and capsules after initial firm growth, the coffee-pod market will continue to provide important support for overall demand of arabica coffee (most pods contain predominantly arabica beans).
Coffee consumption growth in North America will continue to rise
We expect US coffee consumption to continue to grow at a more moderate pace than in recent years. From an estimated 4.8% in 2017/18, coffee consumption growth is forecast to decelerate to 4.1% in 2018/19 and 1.8% in 2019/20, reflecting a gradual slowing of underlying consumer demand growth. That said, coffee consumption is not expected to fall, with the US National Coffee Association estimating that the percentage of people drinking coffee is continuing to rise (up from 57% in early 2016 to 62% in early 2017, according to the latest data). Daily consumption is rising, and consumers are increasingly attracted to a variety of products; for example, US consumption of cold coffee products has risen by 75% over 2015-17. Moreover, the number of coffee shops is increasing at a rate of around 3.6% per year, while the share of 13-18-year-olds drinking coffee has gone up from 23% in 2014 to 37% in early 2017. Demand growth among 18-24-year-olds is also rising strongly, which bodes well for medium- to long-term coffee consumption trends.
Similar dynamics are evident in Canada, with the share of 18-24-year-olds drinking coffee jumping from 48% in 2015 to 58% in 2016 (up from just 32% in 2009). Younger consumers, in particular, are showing a much stronger preference for speciality coffees and for drinking coffee in out-of-home locations. We expect Canada's demand growth, which has been fairly steady at around 2.5% in recent years, to slow moderately to an average of 2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20.
Coffee consumption in Brazil will moderate
Brazil is the world's second-largest coffee consumer, but consumption levels per head are still modest (at around one-third of those in most European countries), so there is scope for a significant increase in demand. As Brazil emerges from a sharp economic recession that caused coffee consumption to remain fairly flat in 2014-16, coffee consumption is showing signs of strengthening and is estimated to rise by 3.6% in 2017/18. Growth is likely to moderate but remain fairly firm at around 2.3% per year in 2018/19 and 2019/20, although the local coffee processing association, the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC), is expecting firmer coffee consumption growth in 2018 as the economy recovers. However, household consumption will remain constrained by high unemployment and rising fuel prices, which will all act as a drag on disposable income.
Continued coffee consumption growth is forecast in Japan and South Korea
Japan is the largest coffee market in Asia, with coffee boasting around the same share of the beverages market as tea. After rising by an estimated 0.9% in 2017/18, we expect coffee consumption growth to accelerate by an average of 1.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20. This growth will be driven by coffee sales in convenience stores, given that the number of coffee shops is falling. Meanwhile, in South Korea the coffee market has expanded rapidly in recent years, with imports more than trebling in the past decade and the number of coffee shops increasing even faster. We expect the pace of growth to slow but remain firm by global standards, at an annual average of 2.6% per year over the forecast period.
China consumption and production data
Until recently we did not include China in our list of top coffee consumers and producers, instead including it in our list of "others". This reflected the fact that the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) does not report China's coffee consumption and production, complicating direct data comparisons with other consuming and producing countries. Widespread acknowledgment of China emerging as a major player in the coffee market has prompted us to amend our tables to include figures for China. However, a lack of historical data series means that these figures should be regarded as estimates.
Consumption
We have based the historical series of our coffee consumption data on a paper written by the ICO, in which it estimates consumption based on production, export and import figures. It provides data to 2013/14, with annual consumption calculated from domestic production plus net exports. From 2013/14 onwards we have estimated coffee consumption based on growth in private consumption to provide a rough guide to the size of the Chinese coffee market. According to these calculations, China is the sixth-largest coffee consumer among coffee-exporting countries, but at 2.4m bags in 2016/17 its market is significantly smaller than those of many coffee-importing countries. By comparison, Chinese coffee consumption remains lower than consumption in the UK, despite huge disparities in population size.
Production
We have used data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which are current until 2016/17. This series indicates that coffee production rose sharply between 2008/09 and 2013/14, more than trebling, but output has since stabilised at around 1.9m bags. This makes China the world's tenth-largest coffee producer.
Demand in China and India will continue to grow
Coffee demand in China and India, which have similar levels of consumption, will continue to grow, aided by still-firm economic growth in both countries, which will lift disposable incomes. Although GDP growth is likely to be stronger in India, we expect coffee consumption growth in China to be firmer. This reflects the fact that the middle class has expanded much more rapidly in China than in India, where disposable income levels for the most part remain extremely low. The emergence of a coffee-shop culture in urban centres is a key factor contributing to the rise in coffee consumption in China, aided by a rapid expansion of international coffee chains. Starbucks now runs 3,200 outlets in 139 Chinese cities, up from 2,300 in October 2017. Of these, around 600 are in Shanghai alone-Starbucks' largest presence in a single city. A new store which opened in the city last December, the Shanghai Reserve Roastery, is the company's highest-earning branch worldwide. Despite signs of weaker sales growth in China amid greater competition from fast-growing start-ups offering coffee delivery and pick-up points, the company is still planning to have 6,000 stores open by the end of 2022. With the out-of-home sector expanding slightly less rapidly in India, coffee consumption will grow more slowly. We therefore forecast average growth of 2.1% per year in 2018/19-2019/20, compared with estimated growth of 2.2% in 2017/18.
South-east Asia also has relatively low levels of coffee consumption per head, but demand is increasing rapidly in some countries, mainly in coffee-producing economies such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Rising incomes are encouraging companies such as Starbucks to expand in Indonesia and the Philippines, where consumption is increasing. Costa Coffee is expanding in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia and opened its first store in Vietnam last October.
Asian markets will drive demand for robusta beans
Given taste preferences for soluble and instant coffee-which generally use the robusta variety-in faster-growing Asian markets, demand will be stronger compared with the more expensive arabica blends. Improved quality of robusta will also play a part here, with such beans slowly losing their reputation for inferior taste. In addition, improvements in processing technology mean that it is possible to use a larger proportion of robusta in coffee blends while maintaining quality.

Supply
The biennial crop season in Brazil, the world's largest producer, will continue to have a significant impact on overall global coffee output trends. Global output fell by 0.3% in the 2017/18 crop year, which mainly reflected a drop in output in Brazil as the crop year switched to a lower-producing (off-season) year. However, we expect global coffee production to rebound by a firm 6.5% in 2018/19. A recovery in Brazil's production as the crop switches back to a higher-producing year will account for over 80% of the global increase in coffee output. Rising production in several other Latin American coffee producers as well as Asian growers will have a marginal but positive impact on coffee output. However, with Brazil switching to another off-season year, we are forecasting a 1.8% drop in global coffee production in 2019/20. We are currently forecasting only mild production increases elsewhere, which will fail to compensate for the decline in Brazil. This is based on the assumption that recent low coffee prices will hamper output in the medium term as cutbacks on pesticide and fertiliser usage affect production levels.
Coffee production is Brazil is estimated to reach record levels in 2018/19
In Brazil, notwithstanding the shift from an on-season crop in 2018/19 to an off-season crop in 2019/20, production in both years is forecast to be high by historical standards. Although some arabica-producing areas reported dryness earlier in 2018-delaying harvest progress-recent weather conditions have been much better, which will bolster prospects for 2018/19. Local observers have stated that there is potential for a bumper crop, with some even suggesting that output of up to 65m bags is possible, which would be a record high by some margin (to date, the highest production was recorded in 2012/13, at 55.4m bags). We believe that this figure is out of reach and are forecasting coffee production of 59.5m bags for the 2018/19 season. This is similar to the estimate from Conab, Brazil's food statistics agency, which recently raised its projection from 58m bags to 59.9m bags. The strong result is likely to reflect a firm recovery in both arabica and robusta production (which are expected to account for three-quarters and one-quarter of total output respectively). Our expectation that coffee production will fall to a still-strong 54m bags in 2019/20 is based on the belief that the continued weakness of the local currency will continue to provide an incentive to growers.
Coffee production in Vietnam is set to stabilise at historically high levels
In Vietnam, supportive weather conditions led to a sharp 15.5% increase in the 2017/18 crop, with coffee production coming in at 29.5m bags. We expect a slight decline in coffee production in 2018/19 and 2019/20, although at around 29m bags output levels will remain high compared with recent years. These forecasts are more optimistic than the authorities' projections for medium-term coffee production, which tend to be fairly low. However, recent weather conditions have been relatively supportive, while government efforts to replant 140,000 ha of coffee, targeting 25,000 ha a year, as well as a rising arabica crop will underpin still-firm output, particularly given that yields from new bushes are typically higher. Firm demand for robusta in the domestic market and other Asian countries will also encourage growers. We expect coffee output to decline by 0.8% per year in 2018/19-2019/20.
Output growth is Mexico and Central America will flatten
Coffee production also stood at historically high levels in Mexico and Central America in 2017/18, growing by 7.6% to close to 21m bags (surpassing the 20m-mark for the first time on record). After several outbreaks of disease in recent years greater use of fungicides and fertiliser boosted coffee production, with weather conditions also proving supportive. We expect coffee production in the sub-region to stabilise at around current levels in 2018/19 and 2019/20. We expect some countries to register slightly weaker production levels, in particular the sub-region's largest producer, Honduras, where output will moderate after an exceptionally strong 2017/18. Guatemala will also register a decline owing to the effects of a volcanic eruption in the south-west of the country in June, which is believed to have wiped out 1% of the country's coffee plantations. However, this will be offset by moderate rises in coffee production elsewhere in the sub-region, including Mexico and Nicaragua, which will benefit from ongoing programmes to rejuvenate ageing coffee plantations.
Colombian production is set to recover after a weather-induced fall in 2017/18
After five years of rising coffee production in Colombia, output fell by 4.3% in 2017/18 to 14m bags as cloudy weather conditions affected flowering on coffee bushes early in the season, which was followed by very wet weather. However, the sector's fundamentals are strong, including a comparatively high percentage of rust-resistant bushes, and as such we do not expect the decline to persist. Recent additional planting in existing plantations has focused on improving yields, which at 18 bags/ha in 2016 were much lower than in other large growers (27 bags/ha in Brazil and 35 bags/ha in Vietnam). As a result we expect production to recover in 2018/19 and 2019/20, with output growing by 5% and 2% respectively. Towards the end of the forecast period the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the then FARC rebels will allow coffee cultivation to expand in previously isolated areas of the country (although we view the government's statements that output could reach 20m bags by 2020 as overly optimistic).
Coffee production is likely to recover but remain fairly weak in Indonesia
Indonesia's ambitious expansion plans for the coffee sector, which include more than doubling production within five years to make the country the world's second-largest producer after Brazil, have been completely derailed. The El Niño weather phenomenon brought excessively dry weather to the main coffee-growing areas, affecting the harvests in both 2016/17 and 2017/18. Even assuming a 5.5% increase in 2018/19 and a 2.6% rise in 2019/20, at just 11.8m bags output will remain low by historical standards. Low average yields-at only around one-fifth of the levels recorded in Vietnam-reflect high levels of structural inefficiency in the sector, which we do not expect to be tackled during the forecast period.

Production prospects in Africa, which accounts for around 11% of total global coffee output, are relatively bright. Many of the continent's coffee producers have very low levels of output; together, Ethiopia and Uganda account for 70% of African coffee output. Production rose firmly in both countries in 2017/18, mainly on the back of better weather conditions. We expect output to continue to rise in 2018/19 and 2019/20, reflecting an extensive reseeding programme in recent years, an expansion of the coffee-growing area and domestic efforts to streamline the organisation of the sector.
Stocks and prices
After falling marginally in 2017/18, we expect global coffee stocks to rise in 2018/19 on the back of a sharp rise in production, coupled with continued sales of stocks by exporting countries, with producers taking advantage of weak local currencies against the US dollar to boost locally denominated profits. However, with coffee production falling and consumption continuing to rise (albeit more mildly) in 2019/20, the market balance is expected to remain in deficit. By end-2019/20 we expect global stocks to have fallen to 30.3m bags, which will support a partial recovery in prices.

Coffee prices are increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar
Arabica prices have fallen more or less steadily since the beginning of 2017, averaging around US$1.25/lb in August-September (compared with close to US$1.70/lb in January 2017). Futures prices are trading even lower, with arabica for December delivery falling below the US$1/lb mark in mid-September (a 12-year low), before a recovery to around US$1.11/lb in early October. Given that the global market is estimated to have registered a slight deficit in 2017/18, the fall in prices-to levels not seen since 2013-is curious. We believe that coffee prices are increasingly driven by investment trends, with swings in sentiment often caused by a spate of positive or negative news on the supply side. Coffee prices are also becoming increasingly reactive to changes in the strength of the US dollar, with dollar depreciation tending to lead to higher coffee prices. In recent months speculation about bumper production levels in Brazil in 2018/19 has pushed prices lower. The fact that several large exporting countries are continuing to sell spare stock to take advantage of weak local currencies is also suppressing prices, because this has been accompanied by a rise in coffee stocks in importing countries, which in turn may contain demand in the future.
Aside from positive signs from Brazilian producers, continued high levels of coffee output from other main producers are likely to keep prices suppressed in the near term. We expect prices to fall further in the fourth quarter of 2018, with an estimated average price of US$1.31/lb for the full year representing a 12.8% year on year decline for arabica. Given that the next off-season in Brazil (2019/20) is likely to hit market confidence during the 2019 calendar year, we forecast a recovery in prices to an average of US$1.39/lb in 2019 marking a gain of 6.4% year on year, and growing by an additional 11.8% to US$1.56/lb in 2020 as the global market balance slips into deficit. Prices for cheaper robusta will also decline during much of 2018 as bean supply picks up. We expect prices to average 84.3 US cents/lb in 2018-a 16.5% year-on-year decline-before rising to 90 US cents/lb in 2019 and US$1.03/lb in 2020.

Maize
Demand
Global demand for maize has increased at an astonishing pace during the past two decades, rising from just 600m tonnes at the turn of the millennium to a projected 1.09bn tonnes in 2018/19, up by 3.4% compared with the previous year. Provisional demand projections for 2019/20 are for further, albeit more modest growth of 1.37%, to 1.1bn tonnes. Apart from 2012/13, when US crops were badly affected by drought, consumption has increased each season, with growth averaging 3.1% per year over 2012/13-2016/17. While stocks mostly tightened through to 2006/07, the spike in demand was accompanied by an even steeper rise in production, resulting in a build-up of inventories over the next decade. However, trends in underlying fundamentals have subsequently changed course, with growth in consumption outstripping increases in supplies since 2017/18.
Maize is primarily used as a feed ingredient, which accounts for around 55% of total usage. Amid broad-based gains in world meat production, especially of poultry and pork, demand for high-starch, high-energy feed maize continues to trend higher almost everywhere, with growth averaging around 3% per year since 2015/16. Demand for maize-based biofuels continues to increase year after year, albeit at a slower rate than during the policy-driven boom in the mid-2000s. With production of other sugars and starches also trending higher, partly in response to improved economic conditions, global use for industrial processing has increased at an average of 3.6% per year over the past five year and is seen totalling a record 305m tonnes in 2018/19. Helped by a series of large crops in Sub-Saharan Africa, food maize demand has also seen relatively firm growth in recent seasons and is forecast to reach 123m tonnes in 2018/19.
World feed demand will rise by 3% in 2018/19
Growth in global demand for meat and other animal proteins shows no sign of slowing, with consumption gains driven by population growth, greater purchasing power and changes in diets and tastes. Maize is an extremely useful ingredient in animal feed, which can contribute to rapid livestock weight gain. We expect 3% annual growth in the use of maize for livestock feed in 2018/19, broadly in line with the previous year, with overall demand touching a new record of 621m tonnes. The EU and China are likely to account for much of the increase, with notable gains also expected in Russia, Brazil, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The outlook for 2019/20 remains highly tentative at this stage, as a projected pullback in feed demand in the EU could limit overall use to 627m tonnes. Although this would still be a new peak, it would be only 1% higher than in the previous season.
African swine fever could affect demand for feed in China
African swine fever, a highly contagious viral disease for which there is no vaccine, has recently been detected for the first time in China and is now spreading rapidly. The virus is transmitted by ticks or direct contact between animals, as well as by contaminated animal feed or meat products, where it can survive for months. The virus is not harmful to humans but is often lethal for domestic pigs and wild boars. Infections have also been reported this year in parts of the EU, as well as in Russia and Ukraine. However, with half of the world's pig population located in China, this latest outbreak is by far the most alarming. The local authorities have moved quickly to contain the infection, culling thousands of pigs, banning the transport of live animals and closing markets in affected areas. At this early stage of the outbreak the potential impact on animal feed demand remains unclear. In the short term, any sharp reductions in slaughter rates might actually strengthen spot feed demand, while in the longer term much will depend on the severity of the outbreak and how many animals are affected. At an emergency regional meeting called by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in early September, officials cautioned that the infection would likely spread to other parts of Asia.
World industrial demand set to rise again in 2018/19
Led by gains in the US and China, global industrial use has surged from around 75m tonnes 20 years ago to a projected 305m tonnes in the 2018/19 marketing year. After earlier extremely rapid growth, the US ethanol industry is expanding at a comparatively much slower rate, with almost all gasoline sold in the country now containing 10% ethanol (E10). With exports to China also stalling owing to the current trade dispute, ethanol producers are extremely keen to expand the demand base through other measures. Processing margins are currently very thin, with profitability squeezed by a recent slump in ethanol prices. The administration of the president, Donald Trump, has repeatedly stated its intention to approve the year-round use of 15% ethanol blends (E15). Currently E15 can not be sold for use in non-flex fuel vehicles between June 1st and September 15th owing to concerns about smog formation. Given concerns about performance and fuel economy, any such policy change would probably also need to be accompanied by a big marketing effort if consumers are to be persuaded to use higher ethanol blends.
A breakthrough in NAFTA negotiations
US maize farmers and exporters were relieved by the recent announcement of a preliminary trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. Negotiators have concluded a deal to replace the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), with duty-free access for most agricultural products, including maize, maintained.

Supply
Global maize production has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past two decades, rising from less than 600m tonnes in 1999/2000 to more than 1bn tonnes since 2016/17. During this period production has declined on just five occasions, typically as a result of spells of difficult cropping weather. In general, production has been driven steadily upward by increases in both areas and yields. Amid strengthening demand for animal feed and industrial products, high market prices have encouraged additional plantings almost everywhere. New seed varieties, fertiliser and better farming practices have also been used with great effect to push up average yields, which are now approaching 6 tonnes/ha, compared with 4.4 tonnes/ha in the late 1990s.
The 2018/19 the world supply outlook currently appears fairly comfortable. Farmers in the US, by far the world's biggest producer, consumer and exporter of maize, have just started harvesting a massive crop, while good results are also in prospect in Ukraine, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, China and India. With gains in the major exporters counteracting a smaller outturn in the EU, Russia and South Africa, the 2018/19 global crop is forecast to increase by 2.5% year on year, to 1,062m tonnes, the second-largest on record. The outlook for 2019/20 remains highly provisional at this stage. However, assuming a rise in US sowings and potentially even bigger crops in South America, global output could tick higher, to around 1,064m tonnes, marking a rise of 0.2% year on year.
US output is seen increasing by 1.5% in 2018/19
Despite early planting delays across the Midwest US maize crops developed quickly during the key summer months, speeded up by periods of mostly warm and wet weather. Harvesting has started quickly too, advancing to 39% complete as at October 15th, four percentage points ahead of the five-year average. Unusually heavy rains at the beginning of the month caused some localised flooding in some states, but damage is expected to have been fairly minimal. Early results from the harvest have been slightly disappointing but are expected to improve sharply during the coming weeks. Indeed, the latest survey-based analysis from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests that record yields are now expected in many of the largest producing states, including Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana and Ohio.
With excellent productivity more than offsetting this season's drop in area, 2018/19 production is forecast to be up by 1.5% compared with the previous year, at 376.6m tonnes, 6.1m tonnes above our previous forecast. Large supplies are expected to filter through into export channels, with marketing-year shipments (September-August) seen little changed year on year at around 62m tonnes, equivalent to just under 40% of the world total.
Looking ahead to 2019/20, deepening concerns about the US-China trade war could result in a shift in Midwest acreage away from soybeans into maize. Projecting yields is becoming more difficult, since productivity growth in the past two seasons has been unusually strong, surpassing long-term linear trends even with less than perfect weather. Assuming a 4% increase in sowings and with yields down slightly from this season's record, production could potentially reach 374m tonnes, down by 0.7% year on year.
Early 2018/19 crop prospects are favourable in Brazil
Planting of Brazil's first maize crop, sown mostly in the south of the country and used predominantly for feeding local livestock, has started quickly, seen complete on 33% of intended area as at the end of September. Early conditions have also been quite favourable, with ample soil moisture reported in most areas. Assuming producers expand soybean plantings in central and western parts, there could be large areas of farmland primed for sowing the second (safrinha) maize crop after the oilseeds are collected in the early part of 2019. Given a quick start to soybean planting this season, there is some cautious optimism that oilseeds might be harvested quickly, thereby allowing for an early start to safrinha maize fieldwork, which could support yields. We expect total sowings to increase by at least 4% in 2018/19, which, based on normal yield levels, could see production rebounding to around 94m tonnes (from 81.4m tonnes in the previous year). If prices remain attractive, a further increase, to around 97m tonnes, is possible in the next season.
Emergency taxes on primary exports will be imposed in Argentina
After assuming office in December 2015 the Argentinean president, Mauricio Macri, moved quickly to abolish export taxes on wheat and maize and introduce a series of gradual cuts for soybeans and products. The move was welcomed by farmers and contributed to a renewed willingness to incorporate maize and wheat back into crop rotations, which had been increasingly dominated by soybeans. However, with the government seeking additional income streams as part of efforts to improve the fiscal situation ahead of a new funding deal with the IMF, and with traders deemed to have benefited from a massive slump in the value of the peso in recent months, the president has opted to introduce emergency taxes on commodity exports. Effective until the end of December 2020, maize exports will be subject to a levy of 4 pesos per US dollar exported, currently equivalent to a tax of 10.5%. The announcement coincided with the start of the 2018/19 sowing season. With interest rates also climbing sharply in recent weeks, potentially raising financing costs for input-intensive maize crops, there are now considerable doubts about maize/soybean cropping mixes for the season ahead. For now we maintain our expectation of a modest increase in area, which could support production of around 41m tonnes, a rise of almost 30%. However, with so much uncertainty, this figure could be subject to revision in the months ahead.
A larger than average harvest is predicted in Ukraine
After earlier dryness, the weather in July and August across much of Ukraine was much more favourable for 2018/19 maize crops, boosting yields. Harvesting has now started in all regions, with very good results reported so far. Production is forecast at 30m tonnes, up by 24% from the season before and potentially enough for exports of 23m tonnes, possibly the highest on record. Overseas demand is expected to be very strong in the year ahead, especially from buyers in the EU and China.
Our 2018/19 production forecast for Russia, where maize has become an increasingly important export crop in recent years, is cut by a further 1m tonnes, to 11.6m tonnes, with the risks still skewed to the downside. Farmers had been expected to sow even more maize this season, but difficult weather conditions have prompted many to turn instead to oilseeds, planting additional acreage to sunflowerseed, rapeseed and soybeans. Hot weather in key growing regions has also had an adverse effect on yield potential.

Stocks and prices
With the authorities in China keen to reduce burdensome stockpiles, overall supplies have tightened, and global stocks are projected to decline in both 2018/19 and 2019/20. We expect global stocks to ease back to 278m tonnes by end-2018/19, down by 10% compared with the previous year. As China remains only a small player on the world stage, importing less than 4m tonnes in a typical year and exporting only limited amounts to North Korea, it is helpful to exclude notional estimates of Chinese inventories (no official data are published) in an analysis of world stocks. Because of overall strong export demand, cumulative inventories in the major suppliers (Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and US) are forecast to tighten to 60.9m tonnes at end-2018/19, which would imply a decrease of 8% year on year, potentially the lowest level since 2015/16. Owing to reports of larger than previously estimated US stockpiles, our forecast is boosted by 4.5m tonnes from last month. A similar trend is projected in 2019/20. Led by further drawdowns in China, world stocks could shrink to around 235m tonnes, including 58.7m tonnes in the top exporters.
Using year-end stockpiles as a gauge for measuring market supplies is the most widely used tool for evaluating the size of surpluses or deficits in a particular year. Leaving aside difficulties with definition and whether stocks can actually be accurately judged at any one particular point in the season, the differences in marketing years between the biggest producers mean that any efforts to assess cumulative stocks are subject to even more uncertainties. For example, with South American stocks typically at their lowest in February and those in the US at their lowest in August, any analysis of combined stocks is inherently flawed, since inventories are never as low (or as high) as suggested by just adding together stocks in individual countries.
A relatively comfortable outlook for US supplies
The US is one of the few major grain economies to actively survey its producers and commercial facilities for stocks, publishing the results on a quarterly basis. The latest report, which details stocks as at the end of August 2018 and which therefore correspond to the end of the 2017/18 marketing year, showed inventories at 54.37m tonnes (-7% year on year), including 15.75m tonnes on farms (-21%) and 38.62m tonnes (+1%) in commercial storage facilities. The estimate was significantly higher than pre-report expectations, signalling weaker than expected feed demand in the last three months of the marketing year. However, with record livestock numbers during this time, there was speculation that the larger stock numbers were instead probably linked to an understated 2017/18 production estimate. The larger carry-in boosts this season's supply figure, and incorporating this month's uprated crop number, the 2018/19 carry-out forecast is raised by 4.3m tonnes to 48.5m tonnes. Supplies at this level would be significantly larger than assumed just a few months ago, easily big enough to cover rising demand from local and foreign users. Initial projections for 2019/20 are for a modest tightening in stocks, potentially down to around 46.7m tonnes, which would be broadly in line with the recent average.

Average prices are above year-ago levels
Despite occasional price volatility in recent months, global maize markets have generally trended lower since late August. Price weakness has been tied to the confirmation of another bumper US crop, as record yields more than compensated for a pullback in spring plantings. Traders have been eager to secure outlets on the export market, with US supplies continuing to fill the lion's share of global demand. While this has provided some light underpinning to prices, quotations continued to work lower in September, dropping by an average of 3% compared with the month before. US maize has now established itself as the cheapest feedgrain on the world market, undercutting prices of feed-grade wheat out of the Black Sea region, as well as barley and sorghum. Despite the recent declines, average prices are still around 7% higher compared with year-ago levels.
Mainly because of recent changes to the US supply outlook, world availabilities are looking much more comfortable than just a few months ago. While we still expect prices to bounce higher from current levels, especially if, as expected, the US-China trade war has little impact on US maize exports, our price forecast profile has been pared back further this month. Background expectations for an increase in 2019/20 US plantings have also dampened our price outlook. US prices (fob Gulf) are now seen as averaging US$173/tonne in 2018, compared with an average of US$195/ tonne in the five-year period ending 2017. Price growth is likely to moderate over the forecast period, with growth of 3.4% per year on average during 2019-20.

Palm oil
Demand
Trends in palm oil consumption in the 2017/18 season have been mixed, with demand growth estimated at 5.1% year on year over the season. While consumption in the major importing countries generally did not live up to early-season expectations, major producers continued to drive much of the demand growth through increases in domestic consumption. The changes to The Economist Intelligence Unit's consumption estimates continue to reflect this shift. Our estimate of 2017/18 palm oil consumption has been mainly revised up to reflect higher consumption in Indonesia and Malaysia. The energy sector offers the best prospects for growth in 2018/19, although the relative shortage of soybean and rapeseed oils also provides opportunities for extra palm oil consumption. We expect consumption growth to accelerate slightly in 2018/19, to 5.4%, and to moderate slightly in the following season to 4.1%.
India will remain the largest market for palm oil
In India, estimates for palm oil demand have been below expectation throughout 2017/18. At 9.1m tonnes, these estimates reflect a decline of 2.6%, similar to the levels recorded in both 2014/15 and 2015/16. Although this season's reduction is in part accounted for by the imposition of higher import duties, it also points to a more fundamental shift in demand away from palm oil to other vegetable oils. Using free-trade agreements to import palm oil via Bangladesh and other countries has the potential to undermine the new import tariff levels, although the government is taking steps to limit this trade. In any event, the expected reduced availability of soybean and rapeseed oils in 2018/19 will encourage Indian consumption of palm oil when demand is expected to rebound by almost 5%, approaching 9.6m tonnes. However, given the experience of 2017/18, this forecast may yet turn out to be too optimistic. Further we expect demand to remain subdued in 2019/20 and only grow marginally by 0.5%
Indonesia's biodiesel sector will post solid growth in 2018-19
Indonesian biodiesel production continues to run well ahead of expectations, reflecting the increased competiveness of palm oil as a feedstock following a build-up of local stocks. Improving biodiesel exports, notably to China and the EU, and greater offtake in the domestic market have both contributed to estimated growth of 14.8% in the 2017/18 season. There is plenty of spare production capacity in Indonesia, and the authorities plan to increase the domestic incorporation further. From September 2018 all diesel engines are required to run on B20 biodiesel. There is a wide divergence between forecasts of consumption in 2018/19 (from approximately 11m tonnes to more than 12.5m tonnes). We have adopted a forecast of 11.8m tonnes, reflecting robust year-on-year growth of 11.7%. Indonesia is also trying to secure palm-based biodiesel facilities overseas by linking its purchase of Boeing and Airbus aircraft with the establishment of biodiesel production facilities using palm oil in the US and the EU, which we expect to contribute to further demand growth of 8.5% in 2019/20.
China's palm oil demand is hindered by soybean competition
In China, palm oil continues to face strong competition from other oils, but falling palm oil prices and a modest recovery in the instant noodles sector have improved the outlook. We have made a small reduction in our estimate of 2017/18 palm oil consumption but still estimate growth 6.1%. While the 2017/18 consumption level has ended four consecutive years of decline, this growth level has failed to live up to early-season optimism. The bilateral trade war between the US and China presents an upside risk to palm oil demand; however, there are few indications to date of any increase in Chinese imports of palm oil as a result of this. At the moment we are forecasting only a modest growth of 3.6% in 2018/19. While it had been hoped that the domestic biodiesel industry would import significant quantities of palm oil to process, it now seems that imports of biodiesel are the more likely route to meet China's bio-energy requirements. Future growth will rely on a continued recovery in the edible sector, and we expect demand growth to be sustained at a pace of 3.5% in 2019/20.
Energy demand in the EU will rise, boosting usage
In the EU, palm oil has become a more attractive feedstock for energy production compared with other oils. This is encouraging growth in palm oil imports and consumption, despite increased competition from imported biodiesel. Consequently we estimate demand growth of 1.3% in 2017/18. The pace of growth is expected to accelerate to 2.2% on average per year into the 2018/19-2019/20 seasons. While the long-term future of palm oil in the EU is clouded by legislative issues, we now expect slightly higher demand growth throughout the forecast period, reflecting growing energy use and stable consumption in the food sector. The 2018/19 season is likely to see above-normal consumption growth, reflecting the local shortfall in expected rapeseed oil for biodiesel production.
Biodiesel consumption in Malaysia is set to rise
While the commitment to local consumption of biodiesel in Malaysia has been less strong than in Indonesia, solid exports of biodiesel have provided a boost to the sector. Domestic demand for B7 biodiesel has also contributed to an improved outlook. Our estimate of 2017/18 palm oil consumption has been raised again and now stands at 3.2m tonnes, marking robust growth of 17.5% during the season. A continuation of this growth is expected in 2018/19, supported in part by the expected implementation of the much-delayed B10 incorporation mandate. Our forecasts for palm oil consumption in 2018/19 and 2019/20 have both been increased to reflect the improving outlook, and we expect growth of 6.6% on average per year during the forecast period.

Consumption prospects in other countries are broadly positive
The geographical markets for palm oil are diverse, with the top five consumers accounting for less than 55% of global consumption. With palm oil continuing to improve its competitive position vis-à-vis other oils, these "other" markets have been active buyers of palm oil. Our estimates of consumption by these other consumers over the forecast period have been increased, and we expect them to sustain demand growth of 4.2% per year over the forecast period, similar to our estimate for 2017/18.
Supply
In 2017/18 we estimate output to diverge from expectations in the main two propducers, Malaysia and Indonesia. While output is expected to exceed expectations in Indonesia, it is likely to be below expectations in Malaysia, dampening our global supply outlook. Overall, we have raised our forecast of global growth in 2017/18 palm oil output only marginally and now expect growth of 5.4% year on year. The fact that the estimated overall growth rates is only just above average is mildly surprising, given the strong growth in output in 2016/17. Slowing growth in global production is likely to be a feature of the next two seasons. Despite the slowdown, output is forecast to expand by 3.7% in the 2018/19 season and by a further 1.2% in the following year. The deccelerating trend chiefly reflects the slow expansion in mature area and only sluggish yield growth.
Yield cycle may offset favourable growing conditions
Indonesian production of palm oil continues to exceed expectations and is now estimated to expand by 4.5% year on year in 2017/18. Our estimates of output in 2016/17 and 2017/18 are both increased to reflect upward revisions to estimates of the mature palm area. It now looks likely that 2017/18 production will reach 38.6m tonnes, with risks mainly to the upside. While the growth rate is below recent levels, it is building on particularly rapid growth of 17.2% in 2016/17. We continue to expect good yields over the next 6-9 months, although there are early signs that the rate of growth in yields is slowing. Indeed, slow yield growth has been a persistent feature of Indonesian production. Despite the slowdown in plantings, the mature area for next season will be higher. A modest yield increase would result in palm oil production of just over 40m tonnes, leading to growth of 4.5% in 2018/19. Output is likely to moderate in the next season, and we expect output to expand by 1.3% in 2019/20.
Malaysian output continues to disappoint
In Malaysia, output has resumed its normal seasonal increase, but output levels in June and July were almost 20% below those recorded over the same period in 2016/17. Recent output has been closer to year-ago levels. August production was only 10% below last season's level, and it is estimated that September production will be more or less in line with last year's total. We have again revised down our estimate for 2017/18 production, to 19.7m tonnes, representing growth of 4.6% year on year. The 2018/19 season should see an increase in average yields, although any improvements will be inhibited by an ageing tree population. We have adopted a relatively cautious production forecast of 20.4m tonnes in 2018/19, only 3% higher than in 2017/18. We expect output to moderate significantly in the 2019/20 season, when it is forecast to grow by a measly 0.2%.

Thailand output exceeds expectations
There has been a recent slowdown in yield growth in both Thailand and Colombia. The increase in yields in Thailand during 2017/18 has been especially strong, reflecting good weather and favourable oil extraction rates. While our estimate for 2017/18 is little changed, we expect a reduction in output in 2018/19 as tree stress and the probable use of lower inputs reduce yields. In Colombia, we have marginally reduced both our estimate of output in 2017/18 and our production forecast for 2018/19. There remains potential for further land for palm oil cultivation without any deforestation issues. Recent yields have been well above year-earlier levels but should revert to more normal levels in 2018/19 and 2019/20. Some other, smaller palm oil-producing countries, such as Honduras, will also see solid output growth in 2017/18.
Stocks and prices
Seasonal increases in palm oil production underpin continuing increases in stocks in both Indonesia and Malaysia. By contrast, stock levels in importing countries are at, or slightly below, normal levels. Overall, 2017/18 continues to show a market surplus, albeit a smaller one than previously forecast. At the end of the season stocks will be equivalent to 64 days of consumption. This is lower than in 2014/15 but still above normal levels. We expect stock levels to peak in 2018/19 before reverting to more normal levels of around 60 days of consumption in the 2019/20 season.

Rising stock levels will push prices down further
Physical palm oil prices continued to weaken in September. However, they were the most resilient of the major vegetable oils, recording only a very small decrease. Futures prices also eased during the month. We continue to expect global palm oil prices to drift lower during the rest of 2018 and into 2019, given the likely persistent build-up of palm oil stocks. Current projections suggest that prices will reach a trough in mid2019 at around US$560/tonne before starting to increase during the 2019/20 season. The price increases could set in earlier if some of the more bullish consumption forecasts are realised.

Rapeseed oil
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global rapeseed oil demand contracted by 3.7% for the third consecutive year in 2017/18 to its lowest level since 2012/13, despite upward revisions to consumption estimates for the EU, China and India. Rapeseed oil continues to lose price competitiveness against the other major oils, and our forecasts for consumption in 2018/19-2019/20 remain tentative despite some improvement in the production outlook. We expect demand to grow marginally by an average of 0.9% per year during the forecast period.
EU consumption is threatened by biodiesel imports
Despite strong competition from recycled cooking oil and imported biodiesel, demand from the EU biodiesel sector has helped total consumption in 2017/18 to expand by 0.7% year on year. However, the reduction in local availability will inhibit any consumption gains during 2018/19, causing demand to contract by 1.5% in the region as whole during that season. The decline in local availabilities will lead to significant imports of rapeseed for local crushing or rapeseed oil. So far there has been an active import market in rapeseed from the Ukraine, but other sources will be needed to make good the local shortfall and realise this consumption forecast. Following this, we expect demand to rebound in the 2019/20 season by 0.9% year on year, but the pace will be insufficient to achieve the levels seen in 2017/18.
Chinese consumption is limited by supply constraints
In China, local rapeseed oil availability is limited, despite recent improvements in local crushing of imported rapeseed. In 2017/18 we expect demand to decline significantly by 14.4% year on year, but consumption of 4.8m tonnes looks likely to be achieved following active rapeseed oil imports. Higher local estimates of rapeseed production in 2018/19 should help to boost consumption, pushing demand growth to 8% in that year. However, competition for imported rapeseed for local crushing as well as for imported rapeseed oil is likely to be intense. At this stage we project 2018/19 rapeseed oil consumption at just over 5.2m tonnes; given the competition for available supplies, this total may turn out to be too optimistic. In 2019/20 we expect demand growth to moderate to a slower pace of 2.2%
India's consumption will contract over the forecast period
In India, 2017/18 rapeseed oil consumption is expected to grow by a robust 19.4% year on year, driven by improved local availability and strong GDP growth. Rapeseed oil is the preferred oil in north and central India. Local production is typically absorbed along with a small but increasing volume of imports. However, import volumes are being inhibited by high import duties. An improving domestic production outlook means that 2018/19 consumption will at least match the level achieved in 2017/18. Demand is likely to contract over the forecast period, but even though consumption is expected to decline by 4.1% in 2019/20, this level would be still high by historical standards owing to the robust growth witnessed in 2017/18.
Only modest demand growth is likely in the US market
In the US, rapeseed oil has been losing out to cheaper soybean oil over recent years. This pattern continued into 2017/18, when we estimate that rapeseed oil demand declined by 4.1%. This was followed by only marginal growth of 2.5% year on year in 2018/19. In 2019/20 we forecast growth of 4.3%.
After switching away from rapeseed oil in 2016/17, several smaller consumers have recently returned to the market. However, growth in rapeseed oil consumption among this "other" consumers category during 2017/18 has been constrained by more competitive sunflowerseed oil.

Supply
We estimate that in 2017/18 rapeseed oil output remained at 25.6m tonnes, 2.2% higher than in the 2016/17 season. However, prospects for global rapeseed production in 2018/19 have been adversely affected by dry conditions in the EU, Canada and Australia. While estimates for both the EU and Australia continue to be revised downwards, they are being offset by higher numbers for Canada and India. In 2018/19 we expect global output to contract marginally by 0.4% owing to a significant decline in EU output. This decline will be partially offset by buoyant production in other countries, such as China and India. Global production will rebound in the 2019/20 season on the back of strong output growth in the EU, by 1.4% year on year.
Rapeseed oil production in the EU is estimated to have declined marginally for the third consecutive season in 2017/18. We expect this trend to continue into the next season, when production is forecast to contract more significantly, by 5.8% year on year, as a result of the hot and dry summer. We continue to use the European Commission's estimates for a rapeseed harvest of only 19.2m tonnes, making this the smallest crop since 2008/09. The area was virtually unchanged, so the reduction is almost entirely attributable to poor yields, and the decline in output was seen across all the major producing countries within the EU. Even allowing for high carry-in stocks and higher rapeseed imports, 2018/19 rapeseed oil production will be affected by the low seed production level. For the moment we have retained our forecast of EU rapeseed oil output of 9.5m tonnes. A higher output level will depend on very high import levels, which will in turn depend on canola output in Canada and Australia. In 2019/20 we expect production to rebound by a robust 8.3%, rising for the first time in five years.
China will rely on imports for oil production
Chinese rapeseed oil production is becoming increasingly dependent on imported seed supplies, and we estimate that output grew by 2.4% in 2017/18 to 3.7m tonnes. Forecasts of the size of the 2018/19 Chinese rapeseed crop vary considerably. Tight rapeseed stocks are partly a reflection of a reduced estimate of the size of the 2017/18 crop, and our forecast for the 2018/19 harvest remains tentative for now. We have reduced our estimate of the crop size, although for the moment we have retained our forecast of 2018/19 rapeseed oil output growth of 6% year on year. This forecast relies on record imports of rapeseed and may turn out to be optimistic. Demand for rapeseed meal is reported to be strong, reflecting the impact of tariffs on US soybean imports. This in turn is providing good crush margins and should give Chinese crushers an edge in obtaining international rapeseed supplies. In 2019/20 we expect rapeseed oil production to decline by 8.3%.
Canada's 2017/18 harvest will rise
A strong export market for canola has underpinned record Canadian canola oil production in 2017/18, which is estimated to be up by 4.5% year on year. Statistics Canada has updated its estimate of the 2018/19 canola crop, which at 21m tonnes is more in line with trade estimates (up from 19.2m tonnes previously). Canadian canola oil production is typically more dependent on market developments than on the availability of seed for crushing. The larger crop will help Canadian crushers to obtain sufficient supplies in the face of strong competition from China and the EU. At the moment we maintain that canola oil production will grow by almost 2% in 2018/19, before accelerating by 7.7% in 2019/20.

India's production is set to grow owing to higher rapeseed imports
In India, our estimate of 2017/18 rapeseed oil production remains at a record 2.5m tonnes, growing by almost 22% year on year. There is increased optimism for the 2018/19 crop, in part reflecting the government's actions to boost production (measures include higher vegetable import tariffs and increased minimum support prices). Local rapeseed prices are higher, and local estimates suggest that the 2018/19 crop could be as high as 7m tonnes. While monsoon rainfall has been below average, early sowings are taking place under good conditions. If realised, this crop would allow 2018/19 rapeseed oil production to grow by a further 4.3. India has been urging China to lift its ban on Indian rapeseed meal imports in light of the US-China bilateral trade war. Indian imports were banned in 2011 amid quality concerns; we expect the ban to be lifted during the forecast period, providing a further boost to Indian rapeseed crushing. In 2019/20 we expect rapeseed oil production to decline by over 10%.
Australian production could be constrained by dry conditions
The 2018/19 Australian canola crop has been further impacted by drought conditions. Estimates have been reduced, and the most recent official estimate puts the crop at just 2.8m tonnes, the smallest crop since 2010/11. An early and plentiful 2018/19 rapeseed harvest in Ukraine has resulted in an active export market. The harvest estimate remains at 2.7m tonnes. Rapeseed is reportedly the most profitable of the oilseed crops in Ukraine, and further expansion of the area planted to rapeseed is expected.
Stocks and prices
The small market surplus in 2017/18 has allowed a modest recovery in rapeseed oil stocks. At the equivalent of 18 days consumption, stocks are still at the low end of recent years. Rapeseed stocks also show a modest increase but remain below normal levels. With a slightly better outlook for production than before during 2018/19, we now expect the rapeseed oil market to remain largely in balance during that year. However, rapeseed stocks are forecast to continue to fall, which may mean that the production outlook will not reach the forecast level, tipping the market back into deficit. Early projections suggest a slight easing of the stock position for rapeseed oil during 2019/20, but this would only be achieved at at the expense of even lower rapeseed stocks. For now we expect a modest surplus in 2019/20, pushing up stocks to the equivalent of 18 days of consumption.

Concern over production leads to firmer prices
Rapeseed oil prices eased in September in line with the weakness in the edible oil market. Rapeseed oil continues to trade at a high premium relative to other major vegetable oils. Futures prices for rapeseed ended the month virtually unchanged in Canada but were firmer in Europe. We are still expecting rapeseed oil prices to remain firm during the 2018/19 season, although the increases are not likely to be as large as previously expected. Prices are forecast to approach US$900/tonne by the third quarter of 2019 before easing back in the 2019/20 season. In 2020 we expect prices to largely remain range-bound, will little fluctuation from the 2019 year-end price.

Rice
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global rice consumption expanded by 1.4% year on year in 2018/19, to a record 500m tonnes. As usual, the increase is largely driven by Asian countries-with the notable exception of China, where domestic demand is estimated to have edged lower. Latin America and Africa have also contributed to rising global consumption. Prospects for the following season remain tentative, especially since we refer to an international trade year that will not commence until January 1st 2020. Nevertheless, global demand is expected to continue on an upward trajectory in 2019/20, rising by 1.1% to 506m tonnes.
Rice feed use may edge up on increased uptake in China
The use of rice in animal feed mixes could edge up in 2019-20, largely owing to developments in China, which is by far the biggest consumer. The government is looking to scale back production, and possibly imports, to avoid the potential for a further build-up of inventories. In addition, both domestic and export markets offer another way of reducing inventories. While food use could edge lower, it is likely that consumption in feed sectors may grow further as the government encourages the disposal of inventories through feed channels.
Japan has utilised stocks of imported rice in feed mixes, but data suggest that demand for domestic rice feed may have peaked. Overall, the non-food usage of rice globally (including by the industrial sector) will continue to account for only a small proportion of overall demand.
Trade should remain robust in 2019-20
Africa and Asia account for more than two-thirds of all rice imports, primarily white and parboiled grades sourced from Thailand, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. A significant share of the demand in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly for high-quality white and parboiled supplies, is met through imports. Following record global rice purchases in 2017 of 45.7m tonnes, many Asian buyers are likely to be well stocked. Furthermore, strong demand for Thai rice from African buyers in 2017 was largely linked to availabilities of attractively priced rice from the government's stockpile. We expected global trade to increase to nearly 47m tonnes in 2018, with further modest increases expected in the following years through to 2020, reflecting strong demand from Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that trade would still acount for less than 10% of total production or consumption-an exceptionally low share when compared to wheat (the other major food grain) or soybeans.
China's imports are likely to fall over the forecast period
China is by far the world's largest consumer of rice, accounting for almost 30% of global demand. Although locally produced rice makes up the bulk of national consumption, China is also the world's largest importer. Domestic early-season long-grain milled rice still commands hefty premiums over supplies from other major origins in Asia, owing to the easy availability of rice from major suppliers outside China. We expect China's purchases to peak at 5m tonnes in 2018 before declining slightly in the following two years. Although it remains unclear how lower state support will affect rice imports, for now we think that imports are likely to fall in future years as the government seeks to reduce inventories. Nonetheless, volumes are likely to remain substantial, given that local prices are above international values. Although we expect rice imports to fall to 4.1m tonnes by 2020, China would still be the world's biggest importer.
Bangladesh's imports set to fall in 2019-20 as local supplies improve
Bangladesh is one of the leading rice markets within Asia, with annual demand reaching at least 35m tonnes. The three domestic crops cut each year are the boro (seeded in December-January and harvested in April-May), aus (planted in March-April and cut in June-July), and aman (sown in July-August and normally threshed in November-December). Although the bulk of the country's rice needs is met by domestic crops, significant quantities are sometimes procured from the world market, especially in times of shortages. Purchases in 2018 are expected to reach 2m tonnes-more than three times their 2017 level-before falling again in 2019 and 2020 as domestic supply improves.
The Philippines is expected to remain a key buyer
Following the destruction by Thyphoon Mangkhut of over 250,000 tonnes of paddy and amid rising oil prices, which threaten to push inflation even higher, the president of the Philippines, Robert Duterte, has authorised additional rice imports. Stocks held by the National Food Authority, the grain procurement agency, have dwindled to their lowest level in about a decade. In contrast, inventories held by private households and commercial warehouses remain comfortable. Underscoring thin state reserves, imports are estimated to have risen further in 2018, to reach 1.6m tonnes, and are expected to average close to 1..5m tonnes annually in coming years as the country looks to ensure adequate domestic supplies.
Solid growth in Saudi consumption of cereals
In Saudi Arabia, consumption of cereals, including rice, has posted strong growth over the past two decades. As the preferred ingredient for inclusion in feed rations, barley accounts for more than half of aggregate domestic demand, while growth in the use of other commodities, including wheat and maize in the food and feed sector, respectively, has been particularly notable.
Rice is a staple food, with kabsah, a traditional dish, being consumed widely. In addition, significant volumes are eaten by foreign workers, chiefly from South Asia. However, demand for white rice among middle- and high-income families has fallen, reflecting a shift towards an increased uptake of protein as well as fruits and vegetables. Overall, therefore, growth in rice consumption has been relatively modest. Consumption is forecast at around 1.3m tonnes in both 2018/19 and 2019/20, little changed on the previous year, and only marginally higher than the 1.1m tonnes seen a decade ago.
Saudi Arabia's local market is one of the largest in the Middle East
Nevertheless, the domestic rice market in Saudi Arabia remains one the largest in the Middle East-comparable in size to Iraq and second only to Iran. As climate conditions do not allow for domestic rice cultivation, local market needs are met entirely through imports, which are typically of a very high quality and consist mainly of fragrant-especially basmati-varieties. The origins of the nation's international rice purchases have changed little over the years, with South Asian exporters the most important suppliers. Purchases from India and Pakistan are predominantly of basmati varieties, with relatively smaller quantities of high-quality white and parboiled types secured from a range of origins, including Thailand, Vietnam, the US, China and Australia.

Supply
Following some slight revisions to our previous estimates, we now expect global rice production to fall marginally in 2018/19, to 493m tonnes, pending harvest outcomes in Asia's main producers, primarily India, where the monsoon season began on June 1st. All of our scenarios assume continued state support for farmers in Asia, although seeding in China is set to fall as the authorities seek to reduce production-and possibly imports-to draw down excess inventories. In 2019/20, however, we tentatively expect production to rise by around 1.5% to a record 500m tonnes, as bigger crops in some parts of Asia, including India, compensate for falling output in China.
In any year, global prospects are to a large degree shaped by India's main summer-sown (kharif) crop, which is crucial in terms of domestic supplies and the surplus available for export. Planting was completed in the previous month, with government data placing the area at 38.6m ha as of September 20th, up from a year earlier and slightly above normal. To a large degree, the increase in acreage is attributable to the government's lifting of minimum support prices for the 2018/19 kharif season. However, there have been concerns about prospects, mostly in relation to yields, because of a disappointing monsoon, which is crucial to providing as much as 70% of the nation's annual rainfall.
Despite a disappinting monsoon, rice output could reach 2017/18 levels
However, in its most recent assessment of prospects for this season's summer (kharif) crop, the Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare forecast production of kharif rice (milled weight) at 99.2m tonnes, up from 97.5m tonnes in the previous year. This was above the government's pre-season target of 98m tonnes, with the target for the much smaller winter (rabi) harvest at 15m tonnes in line with last season's result. Given these figures, our forecast of total production (kharif and rabi crops) remains unchanged at 113m tonnes-almost the same as in the 2017/18 season owing to an official upward revision. It is almost impossible to make any meaningful assessment of the outlook for production in 2019/20 because this depends on a number of factors, including monsoon rains and prevailing farmer support.
India will remain the leading rice exporter throughout the forecast period
India has been the world's largest exporter of rice since 2011. Volumes have been shaped by demand for high-value basmati varieties from buyers in Europe and the Middle East, as well as shipments of low-quality white and parboiled rice primarily to markets in Africa and Asia. In 2017 India exported a record 12.5m tonnes to world markets, up by nearly 30% year on year owing to substantially bigger sales in Africa and Asia, and especially to buyers in South Asia amid domestic shortfalls. For 2018 the pace of the nation's shipments has matched that of the previous year, and we expect the full-year total to match the 2017 record of 12.5m tonnes. In the following two seasons exports are predicted to remain high as India further entrenches its position as the dominant supplier of white and parboiled rice to global markets.
Drought conditions in Pakistan harm rice production prospects
The rice crop outlook in Pakistan remains uncertain owing to water shortages in the main producing areas, following persistent below-average rainfall since the end of 2017. Water availability in the main reservoirs is estimated to be more than 50% below average, constraining planting operations.
A reduced crop will tighten exportable supplies
Rice sowings usually commence in late May and early June in southern areas of the country, while cultivation in northern areas usually takes place in late July. However, in the current season fieldwork has been behind schedule by as much as 45 days. Some growers will therefore seed much less than anticipated, and yield potential could be significantly down. While the situation may have improved owing to increased monsoon rains, we now expect output in 2018/19 to fall by 2.8% year on year to 6.8m tonnes, from 7m tonnes previously. This will have a knock-on impact on export volumes, given that around half of the crop is typically exported. We project that a crop of 6.8m tonnes would support exports of 3.8m tonnes in 2019, down from 4.1m tonnes in the preceding season. In the following year shipments are likely to edge up again as better crops are harvested.
The Chinese government is keen to reduce inventory levels
Following a fall of 4m tonnes (year on year) in 2018/19, rice production in China is likely to drop further in 2019/20, to an eight-year low of 141m tonnes because of acreage reductions. The Chinese government aims to reduce rice acreage by around 2% in 2018/19 by scaling back low-quality rice production. Ultimately, this is meant to address the significant structural imbalance between domestic supply and demand. In late April the Communist Party leadership of Hunan Province stated that it aimed to reduce plantings by 200,000 ha in the province during the current year, shifting land to high-value specialty rice crops. This development is significant, since state policy had previously been geared towards stabilising or increasing paddy (rice) output. Acreage has changed little over the years, so a fall of 2% would represent the first significant decline since 2003/04. Furthermore, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) outlined lower minimum purchasing prices in early 2018 across all types of rice, with falls of between 8% and 11% noted. This is important, because it represents the second consecutive annual cut in farmer support and suggests that the government is aware that supply and demand must be rebalanced owing to burdensome inventories.
The government has also announced a reform of its minimum price support scheme for rice. This year's programme sets stricter conditions for activating minimum price procurement, which can only take place when the market price has remained below the minimum set price for three consecutive days. The scheme must be suspended once the market price exceeds the minimum support price for another three days. This latest policy shift illustrates further the administration's eagerness to reshape the rice sector by introducing market-based conditions under which rice will be procured from farmers. As with efforts to reduce the production of low-quality indica rice, this underlines the government's awareness that domestic stock levels are unsustainably high.
Exports offer a convenient way for China to reduce stocks
Procurement of early indica rice runs from August 1st-September 30th, while middle and late indica rice procurement runs from October 10th until January 31st. Japonica rice procurement commences on November 1st and must close by the end of February. China's exports of rice have traditionally been nominal and shaped by sales of japonica varieties, including to Japan and South Korea, for example. However, there was a big shift in 2017, with shipments rising sharply, largely owing to sales of indica rice to African nations. These included particularly substantial deliveries to Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Prospects for exports are somewhat uncertain at this stage. Nevertheless, the export market offers a viable way of reducing state reserves during the next two years. We anticipate shipments to African nations to remain significant as total exports range between 1m tonnes and 2m tonnes.
Thailand's main crop prospects boosted by good rainfall
Prospects for rice production in Thailand in 2018/19 were boosted by above-average precipitation in the first half of 2018, and the national meteorological office expects rainfall to remain above average thoughout the crop's main reproductive stage to end-October. Owing to expanded acreage amid high farm-gate prices for fragrant paddy and with yields expected to be better than in the previous season, total rice output in 2018/19 is expected to expand by 1m tonnes (5%) to 21.5m tonnes. This includes an assumption of increased secondary (off-season) plantings.
Thailand's exports of all varieties of rice amounted to 11.6m tonnes in 2017-easily its highest total and up from 9.9m tonnes the year before. The strong increase was mainly attributable to a large expansion of shipments to markets in Africa, with a portion almost certainly consisting of older intervention reserves from the government's long-held stockpile. Since the government is reported to have sold off food-quality stocks from past harvests last year, exporters will have no access to significant quantities of attractively priced inventories that can be sold to buyers in Africa and other regions. We expect export volumes to fall to 10.6m tonnes in 2018, largely owing to lower volumes going to African countries and China. Although sales could trend up slightly in 2019-20, they will remain well behind India's volumes.
The US crop will rebound strongly, with exports also expanding
In the US, harvesting of the 2018/19 rice crop was estimated to be complete on 70% of intended area by the end of September. This represented a modest year-on-year fall, mainly owing to a slower pace of fieldwork in Arkansas, although it was still ahead of the average for this stage in the season. In its latest assessment of prospects, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecast an almost 25% year-on-year expansion of milled rice production to 7m tonnes, driven by a big increase in long-grain acreage and a slight rise in yields. After a year in which exports fell significantly, the bigger outturn is expected to boost the US exportable surplus, with shipments in 2018/19 (August/July) officially predicted to expand by 13% from the year before. Weekly export sales data show that cumulative exports (product weight basis) amounted to about 388,000 tonnes, up from 356,000 tonnes a year earlier. In 2019/20 a further increase in production is anticipated, with exports also seen edging higher.
Rice production puts pressure on Egyptian water supplies
Egypt has traditionally been a relatively small but important rice-producing country. Although the bulk of its crop is channelled to the local market, it has also been a modest exporter of medium-grain varieties to global markets, competing with nations such as the US and Australia. The government has for a number of years been using restrictions on exports to ensure availabilities for local consumption. It is now seeking to reduce the cultivation of water-intensive crops, including rice. According to reports, 1,400 litres of water are used in the production of 1 kg of rice, with agriculture accounting for an estimated 80% of Egypt's total water resources. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation has announced a reduction of more than 30% year on year in the approved rice area in 2018/19, to 304,080 ha. According to local reports, this is because farmers have grown more rice than the government's allotted total during the previous year. In addition, growers have faced financial penalties for exceeding the official area target.
Large-scale imports could feature in the longer term
Given that rice cultivation in Egypt is attractive for farmers, it seems possible that growers could again boost plantings above the allotted target. Nevertheless, we still anticipate a fall in output in 2018/19 of about 1m tonnes, to 3.3m tonnes, the lowest in eight seasons. Although local demand has been falling in recent years as the population increasingly turns to alternative, cheaper forms of carbohydrates, such as pasta, imports of rice are likely to rise to 300,000 tonnes, but this is still small in terms of the overall supply-and-demand balance sheet. However, the Egyptian prime minister, Sherif Ismail, has announced that the country would import rice so as to increase stocks and control the market. While no timeframe was provided, the statement could be significant, potentially signalling a switch to large-scale imports as production continues to fall. Some traders and analysts have suggested that purchases from the world market could end up totalling as much as 1m tonnes/year. Exports are expected to remain officially banned in 2018-19. However, modest amounts-around 50,000 tonnes per year-are expected to find their way on to international market, as has been the case in recent years during times of restrictions.

Australia's production is set to fall sharply in 2018/19
Australia is a relatively tiny producer of rice, with annual production of milled rice averaging less than 500,000 tonnes in the past five seasons. Nevertheless, the country's position in the medium-grain sector, which accounts for the bulk of cultivation, is important. Although output can vary significantly from one season to the next owing to the impact of weather, a good crop will typically depend on yields, which are among the highest in the world. Compared with global average productivity of around 3 tonnes/ha, Australian farmers usually record yields of more than 7 tonnes/ha. The 2018/19 crop will be grown during the Australian summer period, entirely in the state of New South Wales, with seeding beginning in the month of October, while harvesting is set to start in March and end in May.
According to a recent assessment by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, released in mid-September, the area planted to rice was projected to fall by 10% to 54,000 ha owing to reduced irrigation water supplies, while storage levels in the Murrumbidgee valley were estimated at 64% in early September 2018, 10 percentage points lower than at the same point in 2017. With the government assuming that yields will be in line with the average of recent seasons, production is expected to fall by 12% year on year, to 400,000 tonnes. The lion's share of the country's rice crop is usually exported, with shipments mainly heading to markets in the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, where supplies compete with other exporters of medium-grain rice, including the US and Egypt. Prospects for 2019/20 are highly provisional at this stage, since planting will not begin until October 2019, and much will depend on prevailing price trends and water availabilities at that time.
Stocks and prices
We expect global rice stocks to contract by about 7m tonnes in 2018/19 compared with the previous season. Inventories are expected to narrow in a number of markets, and there is a risk that they could fall even more if production disappoints in major exporting countries, such as India and Thailand. In China, the government is actively encouraging farmers to scale back production of low-quality rice and diversify into high-value varieties to curb the recent build-up of stocks. As these trends continue, we expect global stocks to narrow again in 2019/20, to 98m tonnes.
However, caution is advised when making judgments about stocks data; the bulk of year-end figures provided is arrived at via residual calculation, as most countries do not collect or provide meaningful figures. Furthermore, inventories in China on a milled weight tonnage-equivalent could total as much as 70m-80m tonnes. However, since no official data are published, it is likely that the actual level could differ considerably from consensus estimates. As we have previously noted, the exclusion of Chinese stocks therefore produces a more realistic figure for what is available on the world market, mostly located in the five major exporters, and specifically in India.
Asian rice markets exhibited mixed trends during the month of September and in early October. Physical markets in South-east Asian exporters, notably Thailand and Vietnam, advanced over the month amid a tightening of old crop stocks, and as signs of firmer demand from importers provided a boost to the market. This included the news that the Philippines was planning to purchase as much as 750,000 tonnes in a series of tenders for delivery in late 2018/early 2019. Iraq, too, was reported to have been an active buyer of smaller volumes from key origins. As of September 3rd the price of 100% Grade B for export (Bangkok) was typically around 1% higher month on month, at US$401/tonne fob. Similar increases were recorded for the main broken grades, as well as for parboiled rice.
In contrast, export quotations for milled varieties of rice actually fell in South Asia as sluggish near-term demand prospects weighed on sentiment. In India, this compounded pressure from the winding-up of the kharif (summer) season, with another heavy crop expected. In Pakistan, earlier support from worries about production owing to dry conditions in important areas were eventually overridden by pressure from weak demand and initial arrivals from the 2018/19 harvest. In India, early September export values for 5% broken stood at US$383/tonne fob, a drop of US$14/tonne over the month.

Outside Asia, Gulf export prices for US rice (No.2, 4% broken) were slightly lower than a month ago, with pressure largely stemming from the progressing harvest. However, with quotations typically around the US$515/tonne-mark, they were little changed from a year earlier.
We have increased our price projections slightly, reflecting the tightening supply outlook. For full-year 2018 we now expect prices for 100% Grade B to average US$405/tonne fob Bangkok, up from US$390/tonne in 2017. A further increase is likely through to the final quarter of 2020, with the full-year average value in that year at a six-year high of US$416/tonne. The outlook for prices does, however, depend on the current policy environment remaining mostly unchanged. Export restrictions in key world suppliers could lead to significantly higher prices, especially if they were introduced at a time of firm demand.

Soybeans
Demand
Global soybean consumption has expanded rapidly in recent decades, with growth outstripping that of other oilseeds and grains as increasingly large amounts are being channelled into the poultry, livestock and dairy sectors, especially in Asia. Along with their high protein content, soybeans provide an economical combination of fats and carbohydrates. Soybeans are particularly useful when fed in combination with other ingredients to pigs, providing a good source of vital amino acids, as well as being highly digestible. After ten years of uninterrupted growth, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects world demand to rise again in 2018/19, by 4.2% to a record 351.5m tonnes, despite the ongoing US-China bilateral trade war and the consequent imposition of a 25% tariff on soy imports from the US, among other items. With China importing in excess of 90m tonnes of soybeans in a typical year-one-third of which is normally sourced from the US-these tensions provide an extra layer of uncertainty to supply-and-demand forecasts for the current marketing year and beyond. Projections for 2019/20 are therefore extremely tentative. Factoring in potentially below-par expansion in China, world consumption is tentatively seen at 355.8m tonnes, up by 1.2% year on year in 2019/20.
The US-China trade war will have serious implications for soybeans
The principal driver of demand for soybeans over the past decade has been the rising use in Asia, mostly China, underpinned by the increasing uptake in that country's vast animal feed sector, as well as for aquaculture. Growth has been fuelled by a monumental rise in soybean imports since the early 1980s, rising from less than 50,000 tonnes to around 94m tonnes in 2017/18 and crushed at strategically located local plants. Overall consumption growth in China is likely to moderate in 2018/19 and 2019/20 compared with recent years, assuming that rising trade barriers cause China to limit its purchases from the world market. Given the very high soymeal content in feed rations in China, estimated by some to be around 20% for a typical pig-feed mix, there is some scope for soymeal inclusion rates to be pared back and substituted for alternative protein meals such as rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal or distillers dried grains. However, this would probably incur additional costs. With US export prices looking increasingly competitive, even accounting for the 25% import duty, we suspect that much will depend on the determination of local companies to support its government in the trade war. There is also a question mark over whether the authorities would introduce additional non-tariff measures to minimise shipments originating from the US.
African swine fever outbreaks could also affect consumption
China's massive pork industry accounts for around one-third of global consumption of soybean meal, a major feed ingredient for pigs. The recent outbreak of African swine fever in a number of Chinese provinces is therefore of huge importance for the soybean market and could have substantial implications for future demand. The authorities have moved swiftly to control the outbreak, culling thousands of animals and introducing bans on the transport of live animals and on markets in affected areas. However, new cases were being reported on an almost daily basis in early September. The effects on local feed demand are difficult to assess at this early stage, however. Despite lower imports in 2018/19 we expect higher domestic output and some destocking to support modest demand growth in 2019/20. We will keep an eye on these events and adjust our forecast accordingly.
Broad-based gains in global demand are forecast in 2018/19
Compared with Asia, soybean consumption in other regions is relatively small, although it has also risen steadily in recent years, most notably in the EU, South America and parts of Africa. The upswing is expected to continue into 2018/19. US soybean consumption in 2018/19 is estimated to reach an all-time high of 60.1m tonnes, up fractionally from the previous season, with another large crop boosting supplies for processing. In South America the outlook for consumption is much improved for 2018/19, with processing in Argentina expected to rebound strongly should production recover to more normal levels. Consumption in Brazil is forecast to rise by 2.3%, a slightly slower pace than in 2017/18, with increased regional competition and likely strong soybean export demand expected to limit the amount of soybeans sent for local processing. While South American consumption could rise further in 2019/20, a smaller crop could result in a small decline in the US.
World trade forecast to rise more slowly than in the past
We forecast that global trade in soybeans in 2018/19 (September/October basis) will reach 153m tonnes. While China's purchases may actually fall, this will be more than offset by bigger imports by other buyers. Chinese purchases of US soybeans have floundered since April as bilateral trade tensions have escalated. The impact on Chinese processors has been limited, since this period coincided with the southern hemisphere export programme. As supplies at South American origins are likely to be tighter than normal from October 2018 until new crops are threshed in early 2019, it is possible that Chinese buyers will be required to source as much as 15m tonnes from the US in 2018/19, although this is well below its purchases of around 30m tonnes per year in recent years. China's total imports are forecast to fall by 1% in 2018/19-the first fall in eight years-and are expected to remain at this level in 2019/20.

Imports are central to EU requirements
The EU has achieved successive record crops in recent seasons. Nevertheless, at less than 3m tonnes domestic outturns represent only a tiny share of overall consumption. The remainder is typically met by imports of soybeans and soybean meal, which typically account for up to 35m tonnes. After relatively strong gains in the season before, soybean imports are expected to rise by a further 8.3% in 2018/19. Import demand has strengthened, with buyers taking advantage of the heavy fall in US market prices and attempting to compensate for a series of poor rapeseed and grain harvests across the northern parts of the EU. Another season of elevated imports is expected in 2019/20, but consumption is forecast to dip from the levels recorded in 2018/19.
Supply
Following an unusually sharp decline in 2017/18 global output, tied mainly to a very difficult year of cropping weather in Argentina, we expect production to rebound sharply in 2018/19, possibly by as much as 10% year on year, to a record 369m tonnes. While a massive US crop is looking almost certain, there is still a long way to go in South America, where crop projections remain tentative and are still highly dependent on weather conditions. Our very early projections for 2019/20 suggest that US plantings could decline, with farmers perhaps switching to maize and spring wheat. Even if South American crops are larger, world production might therefore drop to 361m tonnes, down by 2% year on year.
US yields are expected to be excellent in 2018/19
US farmers have enjoyed generally favourable cropping conditions over the spring and summer. With plantings completed on time, the weather in June and July was warm and wet in many areas, setting the scene for successful pod filling in August, the key month for determining soybean yields. The mostly favourable weather continued into September, and the second objective yield survey assessment from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests that average yields will climb to a new record high, surpassing the previous record in 2016/17. According to the agency, expectations for pod weight (and yields) will benefit from this season's extended period of crop development. Incorporating this uprated yield figure, we have raised our production forecast by a further 2.9m tonnes to an unprecedented 127.7m tonnes, up by 6.9% on the previous season. Harvesting was almost one-quarter complete by 30th September, a touch faster than last year's pace and quicker than average. Given huge local stockpiles, relatively weak prices and the potential for a protracted trade war with China, there is some pessimism about prospects for 2019/20 acreage. Pencilling in a 3% drop in plantings, and should trends revert back to previous levels, production could possibly decline by 10% in 2019/20, to 115m tonnes.
US farmers will be compensated for ongoing trade disputes
On September 4th the USDA formally launched a US$12bn aid package aimed at assisting local farmers hit by current international trade disputes. The flagship Market Facilitation Programme will provide payments to eligible producers of soybeans, wheat, maize, sorghum, cotton, dairy and pigs. Payments will be made on 50% of actual 2018/19 production volumes, with soybean growers eligible for a payment of US$1.65/bushel, up to a maximum of US$125,000 per farm. Additionally, a Trade Promotion Programme will assist in developing new export markets, while a Food Purchase and Distribution Programme will purchase surpluses of certain affected commodities for distribution through nutrition assistance programmes. While the payments were well received in certain quarters, most farm groups have reiterated their desire for a resolution to the trade disputes with major US trade partners and called for a more permanent solution.
Brazil's economic and political landscape is challenging for farmers, with exchange-rate uncertainty, higher freight costs, US-China trade relations and Brazil's 2018 presidential election contributing to heightened market uncertainty. Problems with inland transport costs have also remained broadly unresolved. With local supplies mainly transported by lorry from producing areas to ports, recent legislation instituting minimum freight rates has had a big impact on the agricultural sector, squeezing profit margins. The costs of transporting fertiliser and other key farm inputs in the other direction, from ports to farms, have also increased in recent months. Brazil's Supreme Court has held a series of public hearings regarding the new minimum freight rates, introduced to appease independent lorry drivers, who launched a damaging nationwide strike in May. However, a decision on the law's constitutionality is not expected to be made until November.
Soybean area is set to increase even further in Brazil
Despite background uncertainty over freight costs, worries about the rising costs of production and volatility in foreign-exchange markets, the allure of high prices and potentially huge demand from China are expected to encourage a 12th successive increase in soybean area in 2018/19. We continue to expect a 4% rise in plantings, with area mostly coming from the conversion of degraded pasture land and a possible switch out of other agricultural commodities. Sowings have started relatively quickly, with progress in the first few weeks of the planting season ahead of both last year's pace and the five-year average. Farmers in Parana have made a blistering start to fieldwork, especially in western areas of that state, where crops could be ready for harvest before the turn of the year. Strong prices should also encourage high levels of fertiliser application, and assuming that productivity is broadly in line with trend, output is projected to reach 122m tonnes in 2018/19, up by 3.4% on the previous season. If US-China trade tensions continue into the following year, Brazilian farmers might be encouraged to plant even more soybeans, potentially boosting 2019/20 output by 1.6% year on year.
A difficult economic backdrop in Argentina
Faced with another financial crisis and the need to appease the IMF ahead of a new loan agreement, the authorities in Argentina have once again turned to grain and oilseed exporters as a source of much-needed revenue. With agricultural exporters deemed to have benefited from the massive drop in the value of the peso in recent months, the president has reneged on previous pledges to gradually reduce taxes on soybeans and their products. Under a series of changes, effective from September 3rd until the end of 2020, the soybean export tax has been raised to 28.5% (from 25.5% previously), with levies on soybean oil and meal raised to 25.8% (from 23% previously). The taxes had previously been scheduled to be reduced by 0.5% per month until the end of 2019. The announcement came just a few weeks before the start of the 2018/19 planting season, due to get under way in central parts in October.
Local prices are currently very supportive, and despite the changes in the tax regime it appears likely that soybeans may be a less risky proposition than maize for many growers. Financing costs for soybeans are comparatively lower, and farmers may be more incentivised to plant soybeans, especially given the potential for increased buying from China. We expect acreage to increase by about 2% in 2018/19. Should yields revert to normal, production is forecast to rebound sharply, to around 55m tonnes in 2018/19, up by more than 47% from the very poor results of the preceding season.
Paraguay and Uruguay could expand production in 2018/19
Production elsewhere in South America is also projected to increase in 2018/19. Paraguay is a modest but important exporter of soybeans to a range of world markets. The EU is the main market for Paraguay, accounting for 30-40% of all shipments, while sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), mainly Russia, have risen strongly in response to rising local demand in the region. Output has sometimes varied sharply from one season to the next but has generally trended up over the past decade. Despite increasing local consumption, this has resulted in bigger surpluses for export. The production calendar is similar to that in southern Brazil, with planting starting around September. Based on expectations for a small rise in acreage, production in Paraguay could rise by 3%, to 10.2m tonnes. Uruguay is a relatively small player among South America's soybean producers. After poor results in the season before, output could potentially rebound by 50%, to 3m tonnes in 2018/19. Since domestic consumption is marginal, the bulk of the country's crop is exported, with China by far the largest market. Other destinations include Europe and Argentina, as well as North Africa and the US.
Production in China is rising but lags behind demand
China is by far the world's largest importer but only a minor producer of soybeans. However, potential has been capped over the years by limited yield gains compared with those of the world's big players as well as the attraction of alternative crops such as wheat, maize and rice. Nonetheless, the government is keen to boost production of oilseeds, particularly soybeans, at the expense of corn in north-eastern areas as part of a supply-side adjustment programme. To this end, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces issued orders in early 2018 to increase soybean planting with the promise of public financial support. Based on an area increase of about 14% year on year, production in China in 2018/19 is projected to reach a ten-year high of 15.5m tonnes, expanding by 8.4%. Given continued efforts to boost production, output could climb by a further 1m tonnes in 2019/20, to 16.5m tonnes. Nevertheless, this still meets only a small portion of overall domestic need, the bulk of which is served by imports channelled to the country's vast feed sector.

Stocks and prices
Amid a period of mostly steady trading, world prices have strengthened from the middle of September, gaining on average of 7% during the next three weeks. Advances in US prices were linked to technical gains in local futures, as well as reports of continued strong ex-China demand, with the USDA confirming a very large sale to Mexico. Worries about wet weather leading to harvest delays added to the bullish tone. Additional support to prices was provided by completion of the ongoing North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations, which culminated in a renewed trade agreement between US, Mexico and Canada.
With these negotiations wrapping up quickly, some traders became more optimistic about the possibility of a timely resolution to the US-China trade war. However, comments from both sides suggested that there will be no easy solution to the current stand-off. Amid dwindling old-crop availabilities and a very strong pace of exports, fob quotations in Brazil (Paranagua) were also stronger. Partly reflecting a firmer local currency, farmers have become more reluctant sellers in the past few weeks, lifting the premium over equivalent US prices from US$60/tonne a month ago to more than US$90/tonne in early October. With Argentina's exportable surplus having been dramatically reduced by the smallest outturn in about a decade, quotations there were largely nominal.

Sugar
Demand
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that global annual sugar consumption will expand at a fairly modest rate of 1.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20 (years ending September 30th). Increasing global consumption will continue to be underpinned by population growth and rising incomes in emerging markets, where urbanising populations are adopting the food and drink habits of developed countries. Sugar plays a key role in this dietary shift as a sweetener in food and beverages and a binding and preserving agent in processed foods.
However, heightened awareness of the health implications of excess sugar in diets will put a brake on consumption growth, amid consumer calls for the food processing industry to reduce sugar and, in an increasing number of markets, the introduction of "sin taxes" on sugary products. These taxes have the potential to suppress sugar demand, although their impact will vary according to the level of taxation, the rigour of implementation and the elasticity of consumer demand. In addition, the growing supply of cheaper, starch-based alternative sweeteners in both Asia (where Chinese production is expanding rapidly) and Europe (where the market was liberalised in September 2017) will limit demand for sugar in the food and drinks industry. Meanwhile, the impact of low global sugar prices on demand will be muted by long-standing domestic pricing policies, which will limit the extent to which lower prices pass through to consumers.
China will remain a key consumer, but growth is set to moderate
We expect total private consumption in China to soften, owing largely to issues in the property markets, but this pressure on real disposable income is likely to strengthen demand for cheaper food and drink products, many of which rely on sugar as a preservative. This will spur demand for industrial sugar. However, consumption growth will be held back by the growing supply of starch-based sweeteners and rising concerns among wealthier consumers about the health implications of excess sugar in diets. On balance, we therefore expect annual sugar demand growth in China of 1.2% per year in 2018/19-2019/20, a level that is above the global norm but well below the pace of rapid consumption growth in China in 2012/13-2016/17.
Import demand will be constrained by higher domestic output and the government's protectionist policy agenda. Amid pressure from domestic producers to support the local industry, the government reduced import permits in mid-2017 to 1m tonnes/year (t/y), roughly half the previous level, and raised duties on some out-of-quota sugar imports from 50% to 95%. Initially these tariffs applied only to imports from the largest global producers, but the rules were amended in August to apply a 90% duty to all out-of-quota imports. Sugar imports have fallen to multi-year lows, and even if China grants some tariff exemptions, weak import demand is likely to prevail through 2019-20. However, China will be unable to scale up domestic production anytime soon to a level that could fully satisfy its domestic demand and preserve its strategically high levels of stocks. It will therefore continue to make purchases overseas, and with prices higher in China than the global norm, it will remain an attractive export destination.
Urbanisation and income growth will drive Indian consumption
Demand in India is forecast to reach 27.4m tonnes in 2019/20, driven by fairly rapid urbanisation and steady income growth. Amid pressure from producers to support prices the government has hiked import duties, imposed stockholding limits on mills and approved plans to create a buffer stock of some 3m tonnes. These measures, coupled with a recovery of demand among bulk consumers during the festive season, lifted domestic prices in the third quarter of 2018. The government is, however, facing opposing pressure from industry stakeholders (who require even higher domestic prices to reach break-even point) and lawmakers (whose electorates oppose government moves to increase retail prices). Regardless of the government's interventions, though, large domestic stockpiles will place a firm lid on prices in 2018/19-2019/20, signalling that weak prices will continue to support demand.
Demand growth elsewhere in Asia is threatened by starch-based rivals
Beyond China and India, the outlook for sugar consumption in Asia is mixed. Demand growth in the more developed countries (such as Malaysia and South Korea) is expected to slow, but this will be offset by rising incomes in populous developing countries (such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam). However, even in these developing countries demand will be tempered somewhat by concerns over the health impact of excessive sugar in diets. Policy measures to ensure that sugar consumption remains within recommended health guidelines will soften demand growth, with sugar taxes now in place in Thailand and the Philippines. Several other Asian countries are considering similar moves, and the prospect of a tax hike will limit investment in sugar-reliant food- and drink-manufacturing industries. Sugar demand will be further dampened by a gradual shift in the food and drink industry towards cheaper, starch-based sweeteners as China (Asia's largest producer of such sweeteners) seeks export markets. In light of these pressures, we expect demand growth in Asia (excluding China and India) to moderate to an average of 1.7% in 2018/19-2019/20, down from average growth of 2.5% over the previous five years.
Health warnings may eventually dent developed-world demand
The liberalisation of the EU's sugar regime in September 2017-when production quotas, guaranteed farm-gate prices and export caps were abolished-has limited the need for imports and brought European sugar prices (which have historically traded at a premium) closer to the global norm. Although lower prices should support demand, the production of isoglucose (a starch-based alternative to sugar) was also liberalised in 2017, which is likely to make a dent in the market share of the sweetener industry.
Health concerns are spurring this shift away from sugar. In many EU countries average consumption levels of sugar are already far higher than recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In an effort to tackle this, in April the UK introduced a tax on sugary drinks, and the French government intends to hike its so-called soda tax in 2018. The WHO scrapped its non-binding recommendation to impose a sugar tax in May, calling instead on governments to improve labelling and regulate the marketing of sugary products. Regardless of policy interventions, we expect consumer pressure to make manufacturers wary of using excess sugar in their products, which will reduce demand growth in the medium term. We therefore expect sugar demand to remain broadly flat in 2018/19-2019/20, despite low prices and population growth.
Changing consumer tastes will boost demand growth in Africa
African consumption will continue to increase on the back of population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation. Several countries (including Nigeria, the region's largest importer, as well as Kenya and Ghana) are pursuing long-term investment plans in the sugar sector in the hope of becoming self-sufficient. However, inefficient domestic supply chains will impede the development of Africa's sugar industries, and most will be unable to compete with cheap imports from an oversupplied global market. Aggregate import demand from Sub-Saharan Africa will therefore remain well above 5m t/y in 2017/18-2018/19. A sugar tax came into effect in South Africa in April 2018, but amid pressure from food and drink manufacturers it has been set at just 10%, and we doubt that it will have a significant impact on overall sugar demand.
Policy changes will shift global sugar trade dynamics
The overhaul in 2017 by the EU of its sugar policy will drive the bloc's emergence as a net exporter. Exporters in the EU will focus in 2018/19-2019/20 on capturing market share in European countries with a sugar deficit, which will crowd non-EU producers out of the European market. The smaller producers, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean, which supply the EU under preferential trade deals, will be hit hardest by this shift. Some smaller producers have increased their market share in China since the May 2017 tariff regime was introduced, but they are unlikely to retain this market under the latest iteration of tariffs. Some countries (notably India) are seeking tariff exemptions from China, but their approval appears far from guaranteed. Brazil, which was hardest hit by China's tougher import rules, has opened a consultation with the WTO to examine these rules, but any possible intervention by the international body is a long way off.
Elsewhere, trade patterns will be influenced by the liberalisation of sugar sales under the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) free-trade agreement, which will probably cause less efficient producers such as Vietnam to rely more heavily on imports from elsewhere in the region (probably Thailand). Intra-regional trade in North America is also likely to increase following a trade deal agreed by the US and Mexico in mid-2017.

Supply
After rapid global production growth of some 11.8% in 2017/18 we expect output to moderate slightly in 2018/19-2019/20, to 181.7m tonnes. This dip will be driven by lower output from Brazil, where producers can respond to the low global sugar price environment by diverting cane to ethanol production. However, global supply will remain high by historical standards, with output in India, Thailand and Europe still hovering around all-time highs. This will keep the global market in surplus and sustain pressure on prices. Most of the world's sugar producers will therefore struggle to break even, and some mills will be forced out of business in the coming years.
This correction will, however, be slow to take effect. Sugar is a multi-year crop, and the industry is characterised the long contracts. Taken together, this will delay the responsiveness of farmers to low cane demand. Moreover, increased cane acreage and greater access to high-yielding inputs will deliver another strong harvest in 2018/19-2019/20 in most markets. Government intervention (notably in India) will also keep unprofitable sugars mills in operation.
Trade deals and policy measures will shift the direction of global trade flows, but trade volumes will ultimately be defined by production levels in countries (notably India) that have significant fluctuations in their domestic supply balance. The bulk of India's output is consumed domestically, but a strong harvest will lead to higher exports; much of this will probably go to emerging markets with costly local production. We expect total trade flows to dip slightly in 2018/19 as most countries already have large stockpiles, but flows will remain above historical norms throughout 2018/19-2019/20. There is, however, a downside risk of further protectionism in the sugar industry as governments attempt to shield their local manufacturers from cheap imports, and this could act as a major weight on trade flows.
Output in Brazil will be determined by price dynamics
We expect sugar production in Brazil to decline to an average of 33.9m tonnes in 2018/19-2019/20. This is largely due to the diversion of cane to ethanol production, which is more profitable than sugar production in the current price environment. Indeed, since the local 2018/19 season began in April, Brazil has crushed more cane than in the previous year, but sugar production is down and ethanol production is on course for all-time highs.
However, ethanol production cannot absorb all of the country's cane supply, and domestic prices of the biofuel are already tumbling as demand fails to keep pace with surging supply. There is a risk that ethanol prices will drop below sugar prices, particularly if the newly elected government caps fuel prices, which would prompt producers to switch back to sugar and sell more supplies into the saturated global market. However, this is not our central forecast, as we expect oil prices to remain relatively high (thereby boosting demand for ethanol in Brazil) and the depreciation of the Real to be fairly modest (thereby failing to provide a significant incentive for dollar-denominated sugar exports). Moreover, even if the ethanol/sugar price dynamic does change, output will be limited by low investment in aging cane fields. The profitability of soy crops in Brazil is also prompting farmers in the sugarcane belt to switch crops wherever possible, and although long-term contracts and multi-year crops will delay this crop rotation, a resurgence in Brazilian production seems unlikely.
A strong post-drought crop revival is expected in India
After a record-high crop in 2017/18 we expect output in India to edge higher in 2018/19, as cane supply remains plentiful. Production is forecast to dip slightly in 2019/20 as drought-like conditions in some parts of the country are negatively affecting plating, but output is expected to remain well above historical norms, reflecting the larger area under plantation. Producers are, however, unable to break even in the current price environment. Millers' arrears to farmers are estimated to have reached some US$3.5bn already, and the government's bail-out package to millers covers just 40% of existing arrears.
The government will therefore remain under political pressure from both millers and farmers to intervene. Policies designed to restore balance in the local industry include removing export duties, setting a price floor for domestic sugar prices, subsidising a portion of millers' contracts with farmers, and subsiding loans to increase ethanol production capacity. In September the government announced mandated sugar exports of 5m tonnes in the 2018/19 season, which according to industry calculations benefit from indirect subsidies that are collectively worth some US$150/tonne. Other sugar-growing countries, notably Brazil and Australia, argue that this tantamount to state-sponsored dumping, and they intend to seek intervention from the WTO. Regardless of external pressure, though, the government cannot subsidise an oversupplied and unprofitable industry indefinitely, and if it wants to bring the domestic market back into balance, it will eventually have to allow some producers to fail. Political expediency and a general election in 2019 (in which the government will be seeking the support of farmers) make it unlikely that this will happen any time soon, though.
Brisk EU production growth following sectoral liberalisation
Production in Europe is forecast to average 19.7 tonnes/year in 2018/19 and 2019/20. This follows a record-high year of production in 2017/18 of 21m tonnes as producers sought to take advantage of the lifting of the EU's 50-year-old sugar quota system at the start of the season. Under the new regime producers (led by France and Germany) extended their crush seasons, thereby making better use of existing capacity, and increased the acreage under plantation. These factors will support production over the coming years. However, output in 2018/19 will be hit by the heavy rains that delayed springtime planting and by the hot summer months in key producing countries, which will reduce sugar yields. However, the impact of recent weather patterns is somewhat uncertain, given the varying crop conditions in Europe.
More fundamentally, European producers are struggling to break even in the current price environment, with Germany's Südzucker reporting a 49% drop in profits in the first quarter of 2018. Weak global prices, coupled with the fact that the liberalisation of the sugar industry has removed the premium at which European sugar was previously traded, will place a firm brake on investment in the sugar industry over the coming years.
In Russia, production will continue to benefit from the significant investments that have been made in modernising sugar factories in recent years. After favourable growing conditions in 2017/18 led to record-high production, though, both cane acreage and yields are expected to be lower in 2018/19-2019/20. Production will continue to exceed domestic consumption, but soft demand in Central Asia (Russia's main market) will lessen its export potential.
Output in Thailand is recovering but pressures are mounting
Thai sugar production is surging as both crop acreage and yields exceed the long-run averages. After reaching a record-high of 13.7m tonnes in 2017/18, we expect output to edge up further in 2018/19-2019/20, driven by more planting. Output growth will, however, be somewhat constrained by the increased diversion of cane to ethanol production. This diversion reflects limited export opportunities in an oversupplied global market and mounting price pressures in the local sugar industry. The local industry was formally liberalised in early 2018, after Brazil successfully argued that Thailand was violating WTO rules on free competition. Quotas for sugar production will therefore be phased out and the domestic price-fixing system will be revoked, but mills are still obliged to reimburse farmers if the final sale price drops below a pre-agreed level. This protects farmers from global volatility, but with global prices at their current lows, mills are struggling to turn a profit. This will lead to some consolidation in the industry. Moreover, weather-related risks are rising as farming moves towards more drought-prone interior regions.
China's output will rise but will still fall short of government targets
After falling sharply in 2013/14-2016/17 owing to adverse weather conditions and the impact of rapidly rising costs of labour, land and farm machinery, China's sugar output has begun to recover. We expect this trend to continue, with output rising to 10.7m tonnes in 2019/20 on the back of normal weather conditions and government support. Despite initial concerns, the sugarcane crop has been largely unaffected by September's Typhoon Mangkhut. However, producers will face price pressures. Production costs have increased, driven by higher prices for fertiliser and pesticides, and prices have come under pressure from a rebound in local output and global oversupply. The government has been quick to intervene to protect local producers by hiking import duties, and this should provide some support to prices in 2018/19-2019/20. Even so, prices will remain too low to spur much investment in the sector. In addition, the sector is dominated by smallholder farmers, labour costs are high, and sugarcane areas do not lend themselves to mechanisation. We therefore expect that China will fall far short of achieving the 10% annual supply growth that would be needed for the state to meet its medium-term production goals.

Stocks and prices
Global sugar stocks increased to an estimated 100.5m at end-2017/18 on the back of a large market surplus. We expect this surplus to decline, from 13.1m tonnes in 2017/18 to 2.9m tonnes in 2019/20 as modest consumption growth is matched by a slight drop in output. Even so, these dynamics will not be significant enough to bring the market back into balance, and successive years of global surpluses will lift stocks. We therefore expect global stocks to reach 111.2m tonnes in 2019/20, equivalent to over 62% of consumption.

A prolonged global surplus will sustain the pressure on prices
Significant oversupply in the sugar industry is piling pressure on prices. Global sugar prices fell to an average of 16 US cents/lb in 2017, down by 11.3% year on year and more than 30% lower than the 2016 peak of 23 US cents/lb. Prices have remained under pressure through the course of 2018, dropping to a multi-year low of 10.75 US cents/lb in August. Prices found some support in September from uncertainty over the impact of recent weather conditions on the European crop and weaker prospects for Brazilian exports as the Real strengthened. However, the Indian government's announcement in late September that it intends to subsidise significant export trade sent prices tumbling again.
Brazil is the only producer able to act as a shock absorber, given millers' ability to divert significant cane supply to ethanol production when prices drop. However, owing to Brazil's falling market share this is insufficient to raise prices, and the link between ethanol/sugar price parity has become less significant globally as a floor on sugar prices. Far-reaching policy interventions by Asian governments are also likely to keep unprofitable producers in the market and delay a market correction. Hence, we expect prices to remain under pressure through 2018, averaging 10.8 US$ cent/lb for the year.
We expect prices to drift slowly higher from 2019. This will in part be driven by the sugar-trading market pricing in more risk, particularly as regions that are highly exposed to weather shocks gain prominence in global supply. More fundamentally, the market will gradually tighten over the medium term as costlier producers are forced out of the market. With traders taking their price cues from markets some two years ahead, this will provide some support to prices. Moreover, as less favourable weather in India has heightened the prospect of a slowdown in output from that country in 2019/20, we have made a slight upward revision to our price forecasts for 2019-20.

Sunflowerseed oil
Demand
Growth in global consumption of sunflowerseed oil is expected to slow down in 2017/18, following record year-on-year growth of almost 15% in 2016/17. Nonetheless, consumption growth of 4% still represents a good performance in 2017/18. With sunflowerseed oil becoming more competitive again, this momentum is now more likely to be maintained into the 2018/19 season. Our current projection is for modest growth of 2.6% in consumption to 19.4m tonnes in 2018/19, with the 20m-tonne barrier likely to be breached in 2019/20.
Improving price competitiveness will boost EU usage
The price discount of sunflowerseed oil to other oils remains at historically high levels, ensuring continued consumption growth in the EU. In 2017/18 sunflowerseed oil consumption, at 4.8m tonnes, recorded a steady increase of 4.4% year on year, following substantial growth of almost 16.5% in the previous season. In 2018/19, however, consumption may be constrained by local availability, although in principle imports could fill any gap. At this stage we expect only a modest increase in consumption of 1.4%. Trends in soybean oil prices, following US-China trade tariff changes, are also likely to have a strong influence on sunflowerseed consumption levels, and we expect EU consumption to grow by 2% in 2019/20.
Russian consumption set to rise in 2018/19 with higher local output
A strong export market for Russian sunflowerseed oil has had a limiting impact on consumption by bolstering domestic prices. Our estimate of 2017/18 consumption is unchanged, at 2.4m tonnes, which marks a decline of 2% year on year. We expect consumption growth to rebound by 2.7% in 2018/19, supported by higher domestic production and continued GDP growth. However, changes to trans-fat regulations may discourage the use of sunflowerseed oil in the margarine sector. Consumption growth is forecast to accelerate further in the 2019/20 season, to 5% year on year.
Transshipment into India increases
India's previously robust pace of sunflowerseed imports began to slow in early 2018, reflecting the imposition of higher import tariffs. However, import levels have since risen again. In part this is attributable to a loophole in India's import tariff arrangements, which allow duty-free imports via countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Transshipment of oils through these locations is rising and is partly responsible for an increase in our estimate of 17% year-on-year consumption growth in 2017/18, to above 2.5m tonnes. We take a cautious view of likely consumption in 2018/19 following two years of substantial growth. The effects of the higher tariff rates will continue to be felt despite the transshipment trade, and imported vegetable oil prices will be adversely impacted by the depreciation of the rupee. We expect 2018/19 consumption growth to be relatively modest at 2.2%, before accelerating slightly by 3.7% in 2019/20.
Consumption growth to moderate in "other" countries in 2017/18
Many countries, including Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Egypt as well as several other smaller states, increased their purchases of sunflowerseed oil to take advantage of competitive prices. In 2017/18 consumption growth in these "other" countries is estimated to have slowed down significantly compared with the previous season. Turkey has recently reduced its import tariff on sunflowerseed as an anti-inflation measure, which could stimulate additional consumption both locally and in its traditional export markets during 2018/19. With sunflowerseed oil production expected to increase, consumption in these other countries is expected to continue to grow by 4.4% per year on average in both 2018/19 and 2019/20.

Supply
We estimate that the overall global supply of sunflowerseed oil in 2017/18 will be close to the record levels achieved in 2016/17. Northern hemisphere harvesting is now sufficiently progressed to firm up forecasts of likely 2018/19 sunflowerseed output. While estimates have generally been reduced, we are still expecting a new record to be set, with output growth of 2.6% in that season. At the moment we continue to forecast sunflowerseed oil output above 19m tonnes. However, this implies a reduction in sunflowerseed stocks and may turn out to be too optimistic, depending on the final outturn of the ongoing harvest. In 2019/20 we expect output to expand further, by 5.6% year on year, reaching new record levels.
Crush rates improve slightly
We have increased our estimate of 2017/18 Ukrainian sunflowerseed oil to reflect the most recent data. At 5.8m tonnes, output will be the second-highest on record, although this will still represent a decline of almost 10% year on year. The sunflowerseed area for 2018/19 is 3% larger than in 2017/18, despite earlier concerns that falling profit margins would act as a disincentive to farmers. With harvesting complete on around 40% of the area, yield reports indicated a final outcome just shy of 15m tonnes (the record harvest was 15.1m tonnes in 2016/17). A harvest of this size should ensure sufficient raw material to boost sunflowerseed oil output to 6.3m tonnes, 9% higher than in 2017/18 but still below 2016/17 levels. In 2019/20 we expect output to build up on the strong growth of 2018/19 and grow by a further 7.7% to a new record.
Russia's 2018/19 crop could be constrained by dry conditions
In Russia, recent crush rates indicate that the final output of sunflowerseed oil in 2017/18 will be around 4.6m tonnes, just short of the record output of 2016/17. Yield reports from the small, already harvested area suggest that earlier forecasts of the 2018/19 crop were too high. Our current estimate puts the crop at 11.7 tonnes, still a new record; some local estimates put the total lower. A notable feature of this year's crop is the significant variation in yield reports, which are making an assessment of the crop more difficult than usual. At this stage we have retained our forecast of 2018/19 growth in sunflowerseed oil output of 1.8% year on year in 2018/19. In the following season we expect growth to accelerate significantly, to 9.3% year on year.
The outlook for the 2018/19 EU sunflowerseed crop remains firm
The record 2017/18 sunflowerseed oil production in the EU is confirmed by the most recent information. The early optimism on the size of the 2018/19 EU sunflowerseed crop has dissipated, principally as a result of poor growing conditions in France. The outlook is more positive in Romania, Bulgaria and Spain. Most estimates put the crop in the 9m-9.8m-tonne range, although some still consider that a 10m tonne crop is possible. We are using an estimate of 9.5m tonnes. We expect EU sunflowerseed oil production in 2018/19 to be lower than in 2017/18, falling below the 3.6m-tonne mark. This would still be the second-highest total on record. In 2019/20 we expect sunflowerseed oil output to rebound and expand by 1.4% year on year, compared with a decline of 2.9% in the previous season.
Prospects for Argentina's crop remain positive
We estimate that 2017/18 Argentinean sunflowerseed oil production will reach 1.3m tonnes, marking growth of 0.8% year on year. We continue to expect the planted area to expand in 2018/19, although some local analysts suggest that the increase may be below early expectations. Plantings have proceeded ahead of normal, and the condition of the young crop is mostly rated fair to good, although not as good as last season's crop at this stage. Our current forecast is for robust growth in oil production of 13.4% in 2018/19. In 2019/20 we expect production growth to remain mostly flat in year-on-year terms, but given the high growth rate achieved in the previous season, this will still be high by historical standards.

Stocks and prices
Although global stocks of sunflowerseed oil at end-2017/18 will be plentiful, this will be only achieved at the expense of sunflowerseed stocks, which will end the season at low levels. Current projections indicate that both sunflowerseed oil and sunflowerseed stocks will tighten further in 2018/19. It is possible that crushing will be inhibited by the reduction in sunflowerseed stocks during the season, which would mean that sunflowerseed oil stocks would be lower than currently estimated, but still above normal levels at around 51 days of consumption. Our early forecasts suggest that sunflowerseed oil stocks will fall to more normal levels of around 41 days of consumption in 2019/20.

Tea
Demand
Global tea consumption is growing steadily, driven mainly by China, which accounts for nearly 40% of world tea consumption and is drinking ever-greater quantities of green tea. However, demand is growing in other major consuming regions as well, including India, which has offset weaker growth in demand in Europe. Despite press coverage of strengthening consumer demand for high-end luxury tea as well as iced tea, this accounts for only a tiny share of the market, with lower-cost varieties continuing to dominate. As such, demand for tea will remain less exposed to economic cycles than other commodities, meaning that tea demand will remain driven principally by demographics. This explains why The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast for tea consumption growth, of 4.6% a year on average in 2019-20, is relatively high and in line with the long-term historical average. It also explains why our demand-side forecasts tend to remain relatively stable, since consumption of tea is attributable to structural factors to a much greater degree than other beverages.
Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, driven in particular by its increasing popularity in China, but the pace of growth will be outstripped by that for green tea, fruit tea, herbal tea, rooibos (from South Africa), purple tea (mainly from Kenya) and high-end organic tea, reflecting their greater reported health benefits and heavy marketing. Iced tea and other ready-to-drink tea beverages account for a small share of the market but have seen rapid growth in sales-notably in the US, but also in traditional markets such as China.
Tea demand will benefit from changing consumer habits
The main tea-consuming countries are also the largest producers, with a rising share of output retained for domestic consumption, partly reflecting domestic marketing campaigns by various tea boards to promote tea-drinking. The premise behind these efforts is that higher domestic consumption will incentivise producers to lift output in order to raise exports. In producing countries, tea will also benefit from changing consumption habits related to rising incomes, but in most places it will continue to remain a consumer staple. Combined with favourable demographics, consumption growth in producing countries is therefore likely to rise further. The fact that a smaller share of tea than coffee is consumed in the out-of-home sector-owing partly to customer perceptions that tea in cafés offers less value for money-will shield tea consumption from adverse economic developments, which tend to have less of an impact on at-home consumption.
Both India and China will continue to see robust demand growth in 2019-20
Tea consumption will continue to be dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2018, up from 48% in 2010. In China, where growth in tea consumption has averaged over 10% per year in the past decade, we expect tea demand to continue to rise firmly, albeit by a more moderate average of 6.9% per year in 2019-20. Despite this strong growth projection risks to our forecast are primarily to the upside; average consumption per head stands at just over 1 kg/year, ranking China 14th in the world. This leaves room for growth, particularly as only around 35% of the population drinks tea.
Given that tea is regarded as a traditional drink, it will suffer from mounting competition from coffee and soft-drink retailers, owing to a growing preference for these beverages among younger Chinese consumers. Moreover, younger segments of the population are also showing a preference for black tea over green tea (black tea consumption has risen by an average of 26% per year since 2008, while green tea consumption has risen more gradually), which should bolster demand for black tea, albeit from a low base. Although ready-to-drink products are gaining market share, particularly in cities, the importance attached to the quality of tea means that sales of loose-leaf tea will continue to dominate the local market.
We estimate that India's tea consumption rose by 6% in 2018. In 2019-20 we expect strong economic growth to be accompanied by higher household spending, firm consumer confidence and supportive demographics, driving annual average growth in tea consumption of 6.4% in 2019-20. Structurally, the Indian market has significant potential-aside from its sheer size, average consumption per head is lower than in China, at just 740 g per year, which bodes well for longer-term demand growth. Currently the out-of-home sector accounts for just under 50% of tea consumption, compared with 85% of the coffee market. From a low base, the expansion of tea bars across many cities aims to lift this share and fuel overall growth in tea consumption.
Structural constraints will hamper tea consumption growth in many markets
Demand in some large consuming countries will be hampered in 2019-20 by market saturation and weakening demographics. Despite a firmer economic performance the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecasts overall stagnation until 2027 in European markets (which together account for 4% of global consumption) as well as in Russia, which accounts for 2.5% of global consumption and is the world's largest tea importer. Turkey, which accounts for around 4% of global consumption, has a particularly saturated market, with the highest consumption of tea per head in the world by some margin. The EU also registers some of the world's highest per-capita levels, particularly in the UK and Ireland. Although our forecasts anticipate further growth in demand, reflecting population growth and in many markets ongoing (if weaker) growth in private consumption, the pace will be fairly mild. In 2019-20 we forecast average annual demand growth of 1.2% in the EU and just 0.1% in Turkey, reflecting underlying economic difficulties in the latter. Russian demand growth will be stronger, at an average of 1.7% per year in 2019-20, but this is flattered by a weak base of comparison following a sharp decline in consumption in recent years.
There is plenty of room for market growth in the US
The US is a small market for tea, accounting for an estimated 2.2% of global consumption in 2018, and per-capita consumption is relatively low. However, with most of the larger tea markets dominated by loose-leaf tea, the US remains one of the most important single markets for instant tea and iced tea, with the latter accounting for 85% of the country's total tea consumption. It also remains one of the world's largest tea importers. We expect demand to increase by 3% in 2019, before weaker underlying economic conditions in 2020 prompt a deceleration to 0.7% that year. In the medium term we expect relatively firm demand for tea, with a continued shift away from carbonated drinks towards other beverages that are perceived as healthier.

Supply
Although tea production has dropped in India, output has recovered firmly in 2018 in both Kenya and China, following a poor outturn in 2017. We estimate that this will cause global tea production growth to pick up slightly, to 3.1%. We expect global production growth to decelerate slightly in 2019-20, to an annual average of 2.9%, below the long-running average of 4.5% growth per year in 2006-16, with several structural factors preventing faster production growth during the forecast period. In inflation-adjusted terms, farmers' profits are lower than in past decades owing to the higher cost of inputs, which will weigh on investment. In some cases, falling real earnings mean that smallholders' incomes place them within international and national measures of poverty. Investment will also be hampered by overall market perceptions that prospects for longer-term global consumption growth are weaker than those for some other, more fashionable beverages such as coffee, despite the fact that global tea consumption growth will remain fairly strong. In addition, many local currencies will remain weak against the US dollar in 2019-20, which will hamper operating conditions for farmers.
Much of the forecast growth in 2019-20 will come from a rise in green tea output, where growth has outpaced black tea by a significant margin in recent years. Green tea now accounts for one-third of total global tea production, compared with less than one-quarter a decade ago. This mainly reflects rising production in China, where loose-leaf green tea accounts for 68% of domestic production, and in Vietnam, where it now represents 55% of tea output, up from 43% a decade ago. We expect these trends to continue in 2019-20.
Structural efforts in China to bolster tea production
China's tea production rose by an estimated 5% in 2018, after heavy rains hit several of the large tea-producing provinces in southern China mid-year, including Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The rains were followed by extremely hot weather in some areas (including parts of Zhejiang), which is likely to have hampered production. However, we are forecasting a deceleration in 2019-20, reflecting broader government efforts to improve the enforcement of environmental regulations, with local authorities destroying illegally planted tea bushes. Although we do not believe that these efforts will escalate to a level that would lead to a decline in tea production, it will take the edge of what had previously been extremely strong levels of tea production growth, at an average of 9.1% per year in 2004-16. Despite the tighter enforcement of environmental regulations, the government will still seek to boost agricultural productivity. A focus on eliminating rural poverty is likely to be accompanied by continued efforts to improve farmers' access to credit from the Agricultural Development Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit co-operatives.
Official efforts to promote innovation, increase the use of technology and lift quality standards will also help to spur production, and better availability and quality should boost exports (only about 15% of tea production was exported in 2016). Germany and the US are China's main tea export markets; although trade relations with the US have deteriorated in recent months, tea has not been included in the list of items attracting US import tariffs. We believe that there is potential for gains in productivity, which would also increase long-term tea output growth, since China's average yield per hectare is low by global standards (at 801 kg/ha in 2014-16, compared with 2,153 kg/ha in India and 2,088 kg/ha in Kenya).
India's tea production will grow slowly in 2019-20
After rising by 0.9% in 2017, growth in tea production in India has been disappointing in 2018. Output fell by 1.5% in the first eight months of the year, according to the Tea Board, reflecting dry conditions in Assam (India's largest tea-growing state) as well as in Bengal and parts of southern India. We estimate a 2.3% drop in tea production in the full calendar year. In 2019-20 we forecast that output will recover gradually, rising by an average of 2% per year. Efforts to channel funding to tea growers and to introduce an insurance scheme for smallholders (who account for 50% of production) to protect against falls in market prices and weather-related crop disruption will provide support, but several structural factors will hold back firmer growth in production.
There has been little progress on reforms to boost foreign direct investment (FDI) in several sectors, including agriculture. Furthermore, India's tea bushes are old: nearly 40% of existing bushes are over 50 years old, compared with Kenya, where fewer than 30% are over 40 years old, and Vietnam, where the entire tea plantation is less than 20 years old. Replanting has progressed slowly, and rising input costs have eroded profits; labour now accounts for 50% of production costs (a figure that has grown by 12% in the past three years). As a result, India will struggle to raise output as significantly as other major producers in the long term. With several tea manufacturers reporting losses (the world's largest firm, McLeod Russel, made losses in India, compared with profits in Uganda, Vietnam and Rwanda), it is unclear how much FDI the sector will attract.
High costs will prevent a significant recovery in Sri Lanka's 2018-19 output
Tea production in Sri Lanka bounced back strongly after landslides and severe flooding in May 2017, with full-year production actually rising by 4.1%, despite alarmist warnings of a collapse in output following the heavy rains. In 2018 favourable weather early in the year has been followed by more adverse conditions in recent months, with tea production dropping by 1.5% in January-August compared with the year-earlier period. We have downgraded our full-year estimate and now expect a marginal fall in output, compared with a previous forecast of 1% growth in tea output. The government's decision to lift a ban on the use of glyphosate weed killer (used by all major tea producers) in tea plantations will provide some support in the near term, since there had been speculation that some key export markets (notably Japan) would cut imports from Sri Lanka on the basis that farmers had resorted to using a replacement chemical, MCPA, which is more stringently regulated in Japan.
However, there are several structural hurdles that will restrict the pace of growth in the medium term. Despite some replanting as a result of a 20% increase in subsidies to small tea farmers, the replanting rate is not high enough to lead to a significant and sustained increase in output. Local reports also show that fertiliser use has been low, and the risk of industrial unrest persists. Sharp wage rises and low mechanisation mean that production costs in Sri Lanka are some of the highest among the world's main tea producers. Reflecting these factors, we forecast a weaker rate of tea production growth, of 1.6% in 2019-20.
Continued production growth in Kenya is likely in 2019-20
After poor weather conditions in the first three quarters of 2017 led to a full-year decline in Kenya's tea production of over 7.4%, tea production is showing solid signs of recovery so far in 2018, with output in January-June rising by 14% year on year. As such, we estimate a record output of 500,000 tonnes this year. In 2019-20 we expect only modest production growth, averaging 2.5% per year, as periodic industrial action over pay disputes, combined with a change in the tea levy on farmers-which is now based on the value rather than the volume of sales-undermines profitability and prevents faster growth. The government has pledged to support small farmers and reduce the tax burden, but conflicting interests and a lack of funds will also hinder progress.
Investment will have an impact beyond our forecast period
Many countries have been investing to stimulate tea production, including large producers such as India (which is raising subsidies for plantation rejuvenation), Kenya (where processing plants are being expanded and production is being diversified to non-black varieties) and China (which is concentrating on raising black tea output for export), and even a minor producer, Ethiopia (where Saudi investment is seeking to expand tea production). Other smaller producers, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Bangladesh, have also seen renewed investment. However, we assume that some of these investment plans will be scaled back or suspended altogether, while others will progress only slowly, reflecting overambitious investment plans, bureaucratic hurdles and broader concerns about long-term global oversupply. In addition, it takes 3-5 years for a tea bush to become commercially productive, so the impact of recent price falls on output will be evident only after the forecast period.

Stocks and prices
With consumption growth expected to outstrip production growth in 2019-20, the market balance is expected to fall from an estimated surplus of 31,000 tonnes in 2018 to a deficit of 181,000 tonnes in 2020. Given that there is no global measure of total tea stocks, it is impossible to gauge the degree to which these movements will affect actual physical stock levels. Stock movements have only a limited effect on prices, not least because much of the increase in consumption and production is the result of consumption and output (mainly of green tea) in China. Although some of the annual production data are broken down into green and black tea, the consumption data are not, which prevents a calculation of the market balance in relation to black tea.
Only a fraction of the increase in production will be exported, and even this will not be in any of the three markets (Colombo, Kolkata and Mombasa) where our average tea price is measured. Prices in these markets respond to demand and supply dynamics in Sri Lanka, India and Kenya, respectively (essentially black tea). Often prices diverge between these three markets on the back of local developments that have an impact on supply and demand in the respective auction or to reflect the quality of tea offered at each auction. For example, prices at the Colombo and Mombasa auctions have fallen so far in 2018 as production in Sri Lanka and Kenya has risen, while prices at the Kolkata auction have fallen as Indian output has declined.

Although some of the auction houses are becoming digitised, we do not believe that the tea market will attract sufficient interest from investors to make price dynamics vulnerable to broader global macroeconomic changes. There is currently no futures market, although the latest meeting of the FAO Intergovernmental Group (IGG) on Tea, which took place in May, discussed the feasibility of introducing one in an effort to address price volatility and differentials between individual tea auctions. However, given that the IGG meets fairly sporadically (usually once a year), we do not expect the introduction of a futures market within the forecast period. Prices will therefore remain volatile and largely led by local supply-and-demand factors.
Prices will retreat in 2019 before recovering slightly in 2020
Average tea prices fell from US$3.19/kg in the third quarter of 2017 to US$2.79/kg in the third quarter of 2018. We expect prices to stabilise around this level during the fourth quarter of 2018; however, this will be not be sufficent to prevent a 7.1% drop in average prices over the full year, to US$2.88/kg. We forecast that average prices will fall further in 2019, to an annual average of US$2.81/kg, before picking up to US$2.90/kg in 2020 as demand remains relatively firm, outpacing production growth.

Wheat
Demand
Global wheat consumption has nearly tripled since the 1960s, to more than 730m tonnes in recent years. However, gains in demand, mainly for food and milling purposes, have failed to keep pace with increases in production, resulting in a five-year period of stock accumulation between 2013/14 and 2017/18 (local marketing years). Although stronger demand for wheat has mainly been driven by a rising global population, it should also be noted that wheat demand growth has generally outpaced population growth. Wheat's popularity in diets has been sustained, as has its use as an animal feed ingredient. A small proportion is also used for brewing and the manufacture of starch and ethanol. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global wheat consumption to increase only fractionally in 2018/19, by 0.7% year on year to 738m tonnes, as gains in consumption for food only partially compensate for an expected drop in use for animal feed. Initial projections for 2019/20 remain highly tentative at this stage. Assuming larger crops and renewed growth in the use of wheat as an animal feed, total consumption is projected to rise by 1.9%, to 752m tonnes.
Rising food use is being driven by emerging and developing markets
Annual growth in global wheat consumption for food use has remained relatively consistent over the past decade. Urbanisation, together with shifts in diets and incomes, has also resulted in greater consumption of wheat-based convenience foods, such as noodles and Western-style bakery products, which are best produced using high-quality wheat and flour. With almost all of the growth in demand stemming from countries outside the main wheat-producing belts, rising demand for milling wheat and flour has been accompanied by an increase in imports in most years. We expect the global use of wheat for food to rise by 1.3% in 2018/19, to around 520m tonnes. Growth will be driven mostly by India, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Similar trends are projected for 2019/20, with overall demand for food wheat predicted to climb to around 527m tonnes.
Growth in mature wheat markets has been much more static, with per-capita consumption of wheat flour declining in some countries in recent decades. In the early 2000s the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets caused a relatively sharp drop in US demand. In subsequent years consumption of wheat for food use failed to recover fully, with more recent declines in per-capita usage mainly linked to rising demand for gluten-free products. It is estimated that as many as 3m people now try to follow a gluten-free diet in the US. Of these, around 70% do not have celiac disease-those affected avoid the intake of gluten commonly found in wheat, barley and rye. As wheat consumption for food use in the US is estimated at about 28m tonnes, compared with about 93m tonnes in India, the slowdown in US growth is unlikely to have a major impact on the generally upward global trend.
World livestock feed use is expected to drop in 2018/19
Wheat is the world's second-most important grain for use in animal feed, with annual consumption roughly equal to the feed use of barley, sorghum, oats and rye combined. Wheat usage is typically equivalent to one-quarter of the amount of maize that goes into animal feed each year. Given shrinking supplies and continued strong competition from maize-especially in the EU and the US-we expect feed use of wheat to drop below recent peaks to a five-year low of 133m tonnes. Demand will depend on relative pricing and overall levels of quality. Following huge crop losses across northern Europe, feed-wheat supplies are expected to be much tighter in 2018/19, and demand will potentially need to be rationed. Feed-wheat use in the EU, which accounts for around 40% of the world total, is currently predicted to drop by around 6m tonnes in 2018/19 to around 48m tonnes as users switch to more competitively priced alternatives, mainly imported maize. Strong export demand for barley may limit how much of that grain is fed domestically in the coming season. However, given this season's very short pasture and grazing availabilities, prospects for the EU feed-grain market outlook are still quite uncertain, and much will depend on how price relationships develop over the coming months. While feed-wheat use in South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam could also decline, feed use in China is expected to rise as more sub-standard domestic supplies are diverted into feed mills in the main southern meat-consuming hubs. Assuming much larger harvests in the EU and Russia next year, feed use is projected to return to growth, provisionally seen rebounding to around 140m tonnes in 2019/20. We expect overall wheat demand to rise by 0.5% per year in EU over the forecast period.
China has imposed 25% tariffs on US origin wheat imports
Following the souring of the US-China trade relationship in recent months, a number of US agricultural products, including wheat, are now subject to an additional 25% duty on imports into China. With purchases mainly linked to quality shortfalls in its own huge domestic crop and capped by a restrictive licensing system, China is usually not an overly large importer of wheat. Annual imports have recently averaged 4.1m tonnes/year, with the US typically maintaining a 32% share. Buying interest has almost completely dried up in recent months, mainly reflecting price considerations, but with some importers also reportedly wary of the risk of additional checks or holdups when sourcing US wheat. Instead, local buyers have looked to secure more supplies from Russia and Kazakhstan. We expect growth in Chinese demand to recover in 2018/19-2019/20 by 2.1%, after an estimated decline of 1.3% in 2017/18.

Supply
World wheat production has reached unprecedented levels in recent seasons, with output climbing to successive highs in each of the past five years. Part of this upswing is linked to a small overall rise in plantings, with harvested area trending marginally higher, but much of this has been tied to better average yields, seen close to 3.5 tonnes/ha in 2017/18, compared with 2.8 tonnes/ha a decade ago. Despite concerns about years of underinvestment in wheat-seed technology, productivity gains have been achieved almost everywhere as farmers employ ever more advanced agronomic practices. However, following extended periods of adverse weather across many key producers and exporters, world output in 2018/19 is projected at 714m tonnes, down by 5.8% year on year and potentially the smallest crop since 2010/11. Harvests are expected to be much smaller than average in the EU, Australia, China and the US, but comparatively good in Argentina, India and North Africa. Despite an earlier build-up of stocks, the sheer scale of the drop in production, combined with a solid demand base, has quickly shrunk exportable availabilities. Prices have begun to rise, especially in Europe, with US supplies gradually turning more competitive. Assuming more normal weather conditions, world production is expected to rebound by 5% in 2019/20, to 750m tonnes.
A drop in 2018/19 plantings and yields will cause EU production to decline
Cumulative production in the EU is forecast to slump by 10.7% in 2018/19, the smallest total in six seasons. Yields across northern Europe were badly affected by extremely dry weather over the summer months, with unusually small harvests confirmed in Germany, Poland, the Baltic states and across Scandinavia. Although cropping conditions were slightly better in France this year, weather in the bloc's leading producers and exporters was far from perfect, with production dipping below average levels. The production shortfall is expected to limit exportable supplies in the 2018/19 marketing year severely, with exports potentially down 6% from last season to perhaps the lowest level seen since 2011/12. We expect the situation to improve in 2019/20, when overall EU output is forecast to grow by 9.6%, still around 3m tonnes less than the 2017/18 level. Winter plantings are now under way. Owing to current high prices and delays in sowing of the 2019/20 winter rapeseed, the stage could be set for a rebound in wheat area. However, after a very dry summer in many parts, rains are now urgently required if fieldwork is to proceed normally.
Russia's output will decline by almost 19% in 2018/19
Based on the latest harvest updates, it appears that recent cuts to our production forecasts for Russia might have been overly pessimistic, with total output now seen at close to 69m tonnes (from 68m tonnes previously), slightly more than the recent average but down sharply from last year's enormous crop of 84.9m tonnes. Harvesting of winter wheat is now complete, with yields holding up slightly more strongly than we had previously anticipated. Yields are, however, down across all key growing regions, most notably in the Volga Federal District, where productivity is down by about 30% year on year. The spring wheat harvest has progressed very slowly so far, but with yields to date better than a year ago. The sowing of winter grains for harvesting in 2019, which has progressed quite quickly so far, is complete on around three-quarters of planned area. Worries about deficient soil moisture have been partly placated by widespread rainfall in late September.
Speculation about possible export controls has gained traction in recent months amid meetings between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Association of Exporters of Agricultural Products (NAESP). While there remains some disagreement about exactly what was discussed at these meetings-with some observers pointing out some subtle differences between Russian and English-language statements-it is clear that the authorities are monitoring the situation closely. Local feed manufacturers are said to be particularly concerned about tightening local supplies and rising prices. There have been some indications that grain exports could be capped at 30m tonnes, including 25m tonnes of wheat; based on the current very strong pace of shipments, this level could potentially be reached as soon as January 2019. This year's early harvest has quickly replenished exportable pipelines, and with a much weaker rouble inflating exporter returns, 2018/19 (July-June marketing year) shipments have started very rapidly. The threat of export controls has also spurred additional sales as exporters look to maximise shipments ahead of possible restrictions later in 2018.
Average yields in Ukraine are likely to drop
Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture announced in August that it had reached an agreement with exporters to ship 16m tonnes of wheat in 2018/19 (July/June), including up to 8m tonnes of milling varieties. These Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are signed each season and are used as an informal mechanism to ensure adequate domestic supplies. In some press reports and across social media the deal was instead reported as a formal limit on exports. With markets already nervous about shrinking exportable wheat availabilities, prices quickly spiked higher before dropping again on official confirmation that exports were not being restricted. The harvest is now complete and is forecast at around 25.4m tonnes, almost 6% lower than in 2017/18. After a dry start, conditions for 2o19/20 winter wheat sowings turned much more favourable in the second half of September. Plantings are projected to be similar to the previous year, but assuming an improvement in yields, output could increase by about 4.3%, to 26.5m tonnes in 2019/20.
Chinese output is expected to drop in 2018/19
Based on the latest production data by province, we expect Chinese output to decline by 5.6% in 2018/19-a five-year low of 122.5m tonnes. Excessive rains have badly affected yields and quality in parts of Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, where final results were even worse than previously anticipated. Local officials have reportedly been instructed to support affected farmers by procuring sub-standard wheat under the minimum support price programme. It is unclear how much wheat will be procured and exactly what it will be used for, but it is expected to be diverted into feed channels as long as mycotoxin specifications are met.
Mixed results from the US wheat harvest
According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US 2018/19 wheat crop totalled 51.3m tonnes (up by 8% year on year), including 32.2m tonnes of winter wheat (a contraction of 7%), 2.1m tonnes of durum (an increase of 41%) and 16.7m tonnes of other spring wheat (an increase of 50%). The massive increase in spring wheat (excluding durum) was particularly impressive, tied partly to a strong rise in plantings and record-breaking yields. Although all-wheat production increased quite strongly from the season before, the crop was still much smaller than average as farmers across the southern Plains sought to minimise winter wheat in their crop rotations. Given the current improved price outlook, producers could be encouraged to plant more for the 2019/20 harvest. Recent rains have provided a good early platform for winter planting. Accounting for some nominal projections for spring-sown wheat, the 2019/20 crop could potentially rise to 53m tonnes, marking a 3.3% gain.

Argentina imposes an export tax on primary exports
Faced with deepening financial market woes, which include a massive depreciation in the value of the peso, soaring interest rates and rampant inflation, the Argentinean president recently unveiled new revenue-raising measures aimed at an accelerated loan agreement with the IMF. As part of this, the president has announced a reversal of his flagship commodity tax-cutting policies, applying a floating tax of 4 pesos per US dollar on primary exports, including agricultural products such as wheat, maize and soybeans. The policy, which is effective from September 4th 2018 until the end of 2020, is based on current calculations and basically places a 10.5% export tax on wheat. With the levy only recently announced, there is still uncertainty as to whether previously declared export sales will be subject to the new arrangements. In the short term, farmers may hold back from selling dollar-denominated agricultural products by means of a hedge against currency movements, especially if foreign-exchange-market volatility continues. However, the announcement will have no bearing on 2018/19 wheat production, as plantings are already complete.
After an extremely favourable start to the cropping year, with soil moisture adequate almost everywhere, conditions have turned progressively drier. Rains have been particularly scarce in parts of Cordoba province and in the north of the country. However, local sources continue to report better conditions in core central producing areas. Because of expected strong returns, plantings increased by around 7% year on year. Farmers are also reported to have maximised fertiliser use, which should be supportive of yields. Forecast production is maintained at a record 20m tonnes, marking an increase of 8.1% in 2018/19. This trend will continue in 2019/20, and production is forecast to increase by an additional 5% in that year.
Stocks and prices
Following five consecutive increases, the world wheat carryover is forecast to contract by 8.8% by the end of 2018/19 to around 247m tonnes, still the second-highest level ever recorded and some 9% higher than the previous five-year average. Stockpiles in China are expected to grow even larger, seen rising by as much as 5% to 132m tonnes, equivalent to more than half the global total. Since stocks there will only ever be used to satisfy local demand, many observers have argued that China should be excluded from global stock calculations. The USDA recently announced that its supply-and-demand outlook would at some point in the future include such estimates. Other organisations suggest that it is perhaps more useful to measure stocks in the eight largest exporters as a proxy for global supply. Cumulative stocks in these countries are expected to tighten by one-quarter, to 61.7m tonnes, their lowest level in five seasons. Declines are expected across the board, most notably in the EU (43%), Russia (30%), Australia (30%) and the US (15%). A smaller exportable surplus and the need to ration demand away from feed channels are expected to provide a floor to prices going forward, especially in the event of further crop downgrades for southern hemisphere exporters or any government-imposed restrictions on Russian shipments. Based on early projections for 2019/20 supply and demand, wheat ending stocks could decline again by the end of the following season by an additional 1%. However, exporter inventories are projected to be larger by 8% in that year.

An earlier spike in prices has been partly undone
World wheat markets have become more volatile in recent months. As the focus turned on increasingly tight wheat supply-and-demand fundamentals, average milling wheat prices rallied by around 15% between late June and mid-August. Despite expectations of much tighter availabilities in the season ahead, around half of these gains have since been reversed. This most recent downturn was linked to speculation that the gains had been overdone, especially given that no restrictions had yet been imposed on Russian exports. While prices have corrected somewhat, falling a little faster than we had previously anticipated, we would still argue that risks are to the upside.
We expect that price direction in the coming months will largely be shaped by the exact size of Russia's 2018/19 surplus and whether or not the authorities move to limit shipments. Any such rationing would probably see prices rise, with demand shifting to other, more expensive origins. Final harvest results in Australia and Argentina may also be an important factor. Average prices are expected to strengthen in 2018, but assuming Russian shipments remain high in the coming years, world prices are expected to show only limited upside potential over the remainder of the forecast period.
