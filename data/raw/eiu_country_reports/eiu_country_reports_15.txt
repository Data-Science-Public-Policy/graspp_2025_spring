Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to serve out its second five-year term, which expires in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration in 2020-24.
- Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24, albeit punctuated by trade tensions. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained in 2020-24. Small-scale military exchanges cannot be ruled out, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slew of fiscal measures announced by the government, most notably a corporate tax cut that will crimp revenue collection. During the forecast period, the fiscal deficit will remain wide overall, as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments. However, we do not expect it to implement additional fiscal stimulus.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to leave its policy interest rates unchanged in 2020 before embarking on a tightening cycle from 2021.
- Real GDP growth will slump to 4.9% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.3% in 2020/21-2024/25.
- We expect consumer price inflation to exceed the mid-point of the central bank's 2-6% target range in 2020-24. The key driver will be a sustained recovery in domestic demand. Our forecasts assume normal monsoons.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs70.6:US$1 in 2020. The currency will remain weak in 2021-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
- India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market 2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or in purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure continuity in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the 2019 election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Social unrest will pose a threat to political stability during the forecast period. Clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, notably Muslims. Violent protests are continuing across India following the enactment in December of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, with some fearing that the change will erode secularism and others concerned that it will lead to unchecked immigration. However, state governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, although some may not implement the changes to the citizenship law.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a key concern in the early part of the forecast period. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of J&K sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, instances of further unrest can not be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be on the outcome of state assembly elections to gauge support for the BJP. However, the results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important. The Legislative Assembly Election in Delhi is scheduled for February, and that in Bihar will be held later this year.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command less than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of a few more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged. We believe that the BJP will perform poorly in the Delhi state election due on February 8th and in the Bihar state assembly elections.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the revocation was announced, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties between the two countries. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March). We believe that this sum will help to address balance-sheet problems. It will also improve liquidity in the banking sector. However, given weak business sentiment, this initiative is unlikely to have led to a significant increase in lending.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Nevertheless, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September in response to weak GDP data for April-June 2019. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotive, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies the option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2% including various surcharges), from 30% previously. This was backdated to the start of fiscal year 2019/20, in order to spur private-sector activity.
Fiscal stimulus measures and the revenue foregone owing to the corporate tax cut will leave a large hole in government finances. We expect the fiscal deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP in 2019/20. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3.1% of GDP by 2022/23. Thereafter, spending pressures will increase in the run-up to the parliamentary election in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit in 2023/24. Our forecast assumes no more tax cuts in 2020/21-2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will, nevertheless, continue over the forecast period; India's tax-to-GDP ratio remains relatively low compared with those of its regional peers. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government. It will seek to expand the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will remain significant, averaging the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP a year in 2020/21-2024/25.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits in some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will hold rates in 2020. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The Indian economy grew at its slowest rate in more than six years in the quarter ending September 2019. Real GDP growth slowed to 4.6% year on year compared with a rate of 5% in April-June. Weak consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. The data have reinforced our view that the process of economic recovery will be protracted. Nevertheless, a series of stimulus measures enacted by the government, coupled with a low-interest-rate environment, are likely to spur demand and investment from the second half of 2019/20. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 4.9% in 2019/20. Fiscal and monetary stimulus implemented in 2019 will help to underpin business and consumer confidence, paving the way for a strong rebound in real GDP to 6.1% in 2020/21.
A sustained recovery in global growth in 2021 will support exports and an anticipated acceleration in investment growth. Real GDP growth is expected to average 6.3% per year in 2021/22-2024/25. Growth would be much faster were it not for the fact that we do not expect any additional fiscal stimulus during this period, nor do we expect monetary policy to be loosened. Indeed, an anticipated tightening of monetary policy in 2021-22 will weigh on business and consumer sentiment in those years. We also expect progress on structural reforms to be too slow to give real GDP a significant boost.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in the agricultural sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We have revised our consumer price inflation forecast for 2020, following a modest upward revision to our global oil price forecast for the same year. We still believe that the lingering adverse effects of an extended monsoon in 2019 will exert upward pressure on overall prices in the early months of 2020. However, we now expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 4.7% for the year as a whole, compared with 4.2% previously. In 2021 sharp increases in food and global oil prices will lift consumer price inflation to 4.6% on average. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon in that year.
The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in late 2021 will offset the inflationary impact of continued strengthening in oil prices in 2022, keeping consumer price growth steady at 4.4%. As oil prices stabilise in 2023-24 and the RBI accords a higher priority to containing inflationary pressures, consumer price growth is expected to ease to an average of 4.3%.
Low global prices for oil and industrial raw materials will keep producer price inflation muted at 1.7% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.4% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive monetary loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status and changes to the citizenship law, have weighed on the exchange rate. We now believe that ongoing anti-citizenship protests will depress the rupee:US$ exchange rate in the first quarter of this year, and that the rupee will depreciate on an annual average basis to Rs70.61:US$1. We had previously expected the rupee to stabilise at around Rs70.27:US$1. However, the rate of depreciation will be shallow as the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) loosens monetary policy further.
In 2021-23 the rupee will continue its gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. We expect the rupee to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external payment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Stronger investment from 2020 and higher oil prices from 2021 will swell the import bill, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP annually in 2020-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$47bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to higher taxes imposed on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit previously expected the socioeconomic crisis (which has been ongoing since 2019) and the subsequent collapse in oil revenue to trigger regime change. However, in recent months risks to this assumption have risen, and our baseline forecast now assumes that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. On this basis, we expect an ongoing deterioration of the economy, continued outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions, and their impact on oil production, the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. We do not expect the US government to renew waivers on Chevron and other US oil companies in July 2020; this will destabilise crude production, at least in the short term. Moreover, given that it will lose control over the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- The government has recently allowed the official exchange rate to float, which has alleviated pressures on its foreign-exchange reserves. Furthermore, de facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding, which aids price stability and therefore increases the availability of some basic goods. These measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, down from 80th in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens, despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Limited rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain subdued, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but continued risk of water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit had long maintained that Venezuela's economic crisis would be a trigger for regime change. However, the risks to this assumption were always high and have grown in recent months. We have therefore changed our baseline forecasts to assume that the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) will retain power, despite severe economic and international pressure. Mr Maduro has remained in office amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The imposition of US sanctions has taken a dramatic economic toll on Venezuela, in particular by causing a collapse in oil production. However, in recent months a shift towards Asian markets has provided some stability to oil production, as has support from Russia and Cuba to circumvent US sanctions. In addition, the regime continues to benefit from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities. These sources of US dollar have prevented sanctions from fatally wounding the regime's patronage system. It is this patronage-along with strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces, and purges within its ranks-that has allowed the regime to manage internal dissent.
Internal and external efforts to oust Mr Maduro are fading. The opposition, led by the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in early 2019 after abortive dialogue efforts and, in particular, after a failed uprising in April. International pressure has plateaued as the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, has shifted its attention to the November 2020 US presidential election; meanwhile the Lima Group (a multilateral body of mostly Latin American nations set up in 2017 to discuss the situation in Venezuela) and the Organisation of American States (OAS) seem to have exhausted most of their diplomatic ammunition. Large-scale emigration has also benefited Mr Maduro. The exodus has eased pressure on the Maduro regime, and increasing inflows of workers' remittances provide the regime with hard currency. Furthermore, the population has grown protest-weary, and the economy has stabilised, in relative terms. De facto dollarisation has brought about an improvement in price stability and, combined with a de facto lifting of price and foreign-exchange controls, has increased the availability of some basic goods.
Although it is no longer our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is still a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are set to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The risks of such a political transition will be particularly high in 2020. We expect the Trump administration to refuse to grant an additional sanctions waiver to Chevron and other US oil services firms in July. This will again destabilise oil production in the short term and test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. Perhaps most important, however, is the fact that the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly-the only remaining legitimate body-in January 2021, assuming that the regime engineers rigged elections in late 2020. Without such power, the possibility of a transition towards an opposition-led or mixed administration would plummet. Mr Guaidó and the opposition will therefore be under pressure to try to force a regime change before then; the prospect of the PSUV clinging to power on a permanent basis could prove a trigger for a renewed popular uprising. In such an environment, and if sanctions bite further, pragmatists within the government and the military could finally turn on Mr Maduro, paving the way for some sort of political transition. The country's crumbling infrastructure could also act as a trigger for transition. A particularly dry summer (January-April) could exacerbate what is already likely to be a difficult season in 2020, leading to severe electricity and water shortages, with the prospect of protests against the regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch On the assumption that the Maduro regime clings to power, legislative elections will take place in December 2020. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and so the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The most important of the US sanctions is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September the US also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. Moreover, we expect waivers that allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela not to be renewed in July 2020, given the approaching US presidential election. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA, the state oil company. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. That said, Russia is believed to be helping PDVSA to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). However, Russia's interest in Venezuela is mainly geopolitical, not economic. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor in order to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends Given our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. In recent months there has been evidence of attempts to tighten monetary policy, in order to rein in hyperinflation and abandon foreign-exchange controls (official exchange rates are in line with the black market). De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. De facto elimination of a host of controls is also occurring, and has had a beneficial impact on the availability of goods. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit in 2020 to remain well into double digits as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, growing remittance inflows and the collapse of domestic demand will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. The public debt/GDP ratio will remain high in the coming years; however, the sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. At present we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. The country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October and was not paid. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate president, currently considers Citgo and its Caribbean facilities to be under Mr Guaidó's purview. As a result, the latest sanctions from the US Treasury department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. We expect the Trump administration to keep these measures in place during 2020. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (currently legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of 2019 and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary steadying effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed some stabilisation of the bolívar in 2019. Nevertheless, the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline of 20.5% in 2020. This will be driven by weaker private demand, owing to falling real incomes, continued migration, and-most importantly-a further contraction in oil output. We forecast that economic growth in 2021-24 will contract at an annual average rate of 4.6%, a more moderate rate of decline than in previous years, assuming a stabilisation of oil output. Private consumption will continue to contract in 2020 as unemployment, violence and falling incomes continue to force mass migration, further weakening domestic demand.
We expect the US's prohibition of Chevron and other US oil companies from operating in Venezuela to curb oil production at the Petropiar joint venture (between Chevron and PDVSA) in the Orinoco Belt. The impact on oil production will be limited in the short term; after the ban PDVSA would either take full control of the venture or assume joint control with other partners, most likely the Russian oil company, Rosneft. Even so, we expect oil output to slip to just 600,000 barrels/day in 2020. Under PDVSA control, crude production will fail to reach previous figures. In the medium term we expect oil output to continue to fall-albeit more gradually-owing to serious operational problems, such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or in finding qualified staff.
Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24, on the back of moderately higher global oil prices, and as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. In addition, import compression will continue, which means that net exports will partly offset chronically weak internal demand.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which are based on the assumption that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of this improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were published recently by the BCV, but there is a significant divergence between these figures and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions regarding the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit will cause inflation to come down from the hyperinflationary rates of recent years. Nevertheless, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, as well as the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls in mid-2019. Although this is a positive move, access to US dollars via formal means is limited, as significant barriers remain in place that in practice restrict access to dollars. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On December 12th the official exchange rate was BsS46,234:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS47,100:US$1. The premium (currently at 2%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, averaging 4.3% of GDP in 2020-24. The trade surplus will recover gradually as international oil prices increase moderately and the country steps up exports to Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Abstract: During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. [...]domestic demand has remained firm, with private consumption supported by widespread labour market improvements, and investment growth fuelled by high capacity-utilisation rates and favourable lending conditions.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars. The EU's creation dates back to the Rome Treaty of 1957, which created the European Economic Community between the six founding EU member states (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). After four enlargements in 1973 (UK, Denmark, Ireland), 1981 (Greece), 1986 (Spain and Portugal) and 1995 (Austria, Finland and Sweden), the EU counted 15 members. The collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU; UK-EU negotiations on the UK's exit from the EU have so far been difficult. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than those of other east European countries. The effects of war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-eastern Europe. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, many countries continue to have deep economic and political ties with Russia.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular, the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-notably those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at EU level. A total of 19 EU members share the euro as their currency and are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have sometimes been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster-and more successfully-with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with traditional mainstream parties will persist during the forecast period (2020-24), leading to a more fragmented political landscape and making government formation difficult.
The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) lost their parliamentary majority after the May 2019 European Parliament elections.
The elections resulted in a more fractious parliament, leading to a contested appointment process for the new European Commission and a difficult start for its president, Ursula von der Leyen.
Ms von der Leyen has put forward an ambitious policy agenda, but geopolitical and policy divisions in the EU will stymie progress, including on budgets, foreign policy and security, migration and trade.
Following the Conservative Party victory in the UK in a snap election on December 12th, parliament will pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the UK will leave the EU on January 31st 2020.
Economic policy
The euro zone will resist steps towards full fiscal integration, but the Franco-German axis will drive forwards some plans for innovation and industrial strategy. Some countries will push back against EU and euro zone rules.
At its September 2019 meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a new stimulus package, sending a strong signal that ultra-loose monetary policy will persist in the medium term and at least into 2021.
Economic growth
The euro zone's economic recovery stalled in 2019 and we expect a substantial slowdown in growth rates across the bloc this year and next, before growth picks up again from 2021.
The main reason for the slowdown is a deterioration of the external environment since the start of 2018, with softer global trade volumes, high geopolitical uncertainty and the ongoing risk of a "no-deal" Brexit.
However, domestic demand has remained firm, with private consumption supported by widespread labour market improvements, and investment growth fuelled by high capacity-utilisation rates and favourable lending conditions.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries, as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace, and this will continue.

Political outlook: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period (2020-24). Threats to European political stability over the medium term include the damaging impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU; the impact of the America First policies put in place by the US president, Donald Trump; disagreement over how to manage migration policy and the proper balance between national sovereignty and "pooled sover-eignty"; the impact of an economic growth slowdown on already dwindling support for the mainstream political parties; and increased divergence over values between political elites and electorates.
The negative political fallout from the global financial crisis and euro zone crisis, as well as the long-term erosion of the traditional political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. The fragmentation of the political landscape is leading to delays in forming governments after elections and an increase in unstable coalition governments. The populist insurgency has hampered reform efforts at both the national and regional levels, and a meaningful overhaul of the European institutional framework is unlikely.
Brexit will present a major challenge to the unity of the EU in the medium term
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a challenge for the bloc, and the departure of one of the EU's largest members will continue to reverberate after the UK leaves (at the end of January 2020 according to our forecast). The country's departure will leave a hole in the EU budget, which will be difficult to overcome without generating antagonism within the bloc. So far Brexit has resulted in increased European solidarity because leading member states such as France and Germany are keen to send a strong political message that a departure from the bloc will be more damaging for the exiting member state than for the EU. However, over the medium to longer term such unity could fray, especially if the UK were to thrive outside the EU.
Building consensus for strategic change at the European level will be difficult
The European Parliament elections in May 2019 resulted in a more fragmented parliament, and the subsequent process of appointing candidates to the top jobs was protracted. In July EU heads of state reached a compromise on Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president; Christine Lagarde as the president of the European Central Bank (ECB); Charles Michel as president of the European Council; and Josep Borrell as high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. Ms von der Leyen's Commission had a difficult start, however, with three proposed commissioners being rejected by Parliament, resulting in the Commission taking office a month later than planned, on December 1st.
Ms von der Leyen plans to run a "geopolitical commission", presenting Europe as an alternative model to the US or China, with an emphasis on multilateralism, fair trade and the rules-based order, rather than protectionism or authoritarianism. Her ambitious policy agenda will address changes in climate, technology and demographics in the EU, with a European Green Deal that aims to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 to be presented first. However, we expect the Commission to face significant challenges-and not just from policy disagreements in these areas. Negotiations on the upcoming seven-year multi-annual financial framework will take up significant time and energy in 2020. EU enlargement is a controversial topic that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has recently inflamed, and building consensus on difficult issues within a fragmented European Parliament will be a tough task.
The political scene in Germany will be less stable than in the recent past
Germany is a leading example of a country where support for the traditionally dominant mainstream parties has declined sharply as the landscape of voter support has become more fragmented. The government installed in Germany in March 2018 is another grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the Christian Social Union (CSU, its Bavarian sister party) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, the seat share of these parties has declined from almost three-quarters of parliament in 2005 to 56% now. Parties that take a clear line on migration and openness have benefitted most from this-notably the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now the largest opposition party, and Alliance 90/The Greens, a centre-left party that stands for an open Germany.
The stability of the political scene has been brought into question since the leadership election for the SPD at the end of November resulted in a win for two candidates who had suggested that they would be keen to quit the grand coalition. They will push the CDU hard for policy concessions-such as a higher minimum wage, a more radical environmental approach, and greater infra-structure and welfare spending-in the second half of the government's term and will threaten to pull out from the government if these are not met. Neither party is well placed for an early election, so we expect some compromises to be reached. Nonetheless, there remains a substantial risk of the SPD quitting the coalition, which could see the CDU continue as a minority government, or an early election in 2020, in which the CDU and The Greens would do well.
Germany has played an important role on the EU stage in recent years, and its economic dominance within the euro zone means that this will continue. The German position on questions of reform-a consensus against further fiscal transfers within the bloc, lukewarm support for euro zone reform, and stronger support for a redesign of security and refugee policy-are unlikely to change. However, Angela Merkel's decision to step down as chancellor at the end of her term has already led to something of a power vacuum and a less proactive role for Germany. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has filled this vacuum in 2019, with a series of dramatic policy interventions on the future of EU enlarge-ment and the role of NATO.
In France strikes and demonstrations will continue to hamper policy progress
In France Mr Macron enjoys the support of a solid majority of deputies in the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), which has enabled him to make substantial progress on his ambitious legislative agenda since taking office in May 2017. He came to power determined not to give in to the sort of street protests that had derailed so many of his predecessors' plans, and front-loaded difficult structural reform efforts in the hope that the results would materialise before the end of his term in 2022.
However, weekly protests by the "Gilets Jaunes" in late 2018 and early 2019 forced a change in course. Mr Macron pledged EUR10bn in tax concessions to the protesters in December 2018 and held a national debate in January-March 2019 in order to reconnect with voters who had grievances to express. This resulted in a new package of reforms that make up "Act II" of his presidency, and Mr Macron's approval ratings stabilised. Nonetheless, public opposition remains vocal, with extensive industrial action planned in December 2019. Many of the protests are driven by opposition to the government's efforts to overhaul the pensions system, whereas others (such as strike action by some hospital workers) are related to growing strain on public services following budget cutbacks in recent years. We expect the government to make further fiscal concessions where necessary and water down reform plans in 2020 to avoid any resurgence in social unrest. Efforts to bring down France's hefty public debt load will be postponed.
Political stability will improve in Spain, but the Catalan issue is still unresolved
In Spain politics has become increasingly unsettled in recent years. Parliamen-tary fragmentation, a litany of political graft scandals and rising regional nationalism in Catalonia pose serious challenges to governance. Against this backdrop, in April 2019 Spain held its third general election since December 2015. The snap vote was triggered by the rejection of the 2019 budget-proposed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government-by two Catalan pro-indepen-dence parties. A highly fragmented parliament, lack of experience in coalition build-ing and shifting party positions resulted in a repeat election in November.
The political environment will remain uncertain in 2020-24. We expect the PSOE to form a government and avoid another election in 2020. However, any government that the PSOE forms will not obtain an absolute majority in parliament. Given that it will be running a minority administration, the PSOE will have to find external support for many of its legislative initiatives, and building cross-party consensus will prove challenging. Ousting a sitting govern-ment is difficult in Spain; the next election will take place at the initiative of Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the PSOE. The timing will thus depend on the difficulties encountered by the new government and on the PSOE's standing in opinion polls. The issue of Catalan independence will continue to rumble on. Support for independence dipped slightly in 2019, but a rebound cannot be excluded. A further radicalisation of support for independence may ensue if the political process is perceived as having reached a dead end.
Complex negotiations will continue even after the UK leaves the EU
The UK held an early general election on December 12th, and the Conservative Party won a landslide victory, giving it a majority of 80 seats. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, will now easily be able to secure enough parlia-mentary support to pass the (revised) withdrawal agreement. This means that the UK's exit from the EU is now assured, and will take place on January 31st. At this point the UK will enter a transitional period during which it will remain within the EU single market and customs union, while negotiating its future trade relationship with the EU. This transition will legally expire on December 31st 2020, but can be extended for up to two years provided both the EU and the UK agree to this before July 1st 2020. Mr Johnson has stated his commitment to leaving this transitional period on December 31st 2020. However, given the complexity of negotiating and implementing a final status arrangement, an extension will probably be necessary. Even if a deal is secured in 2020, any changes to the UK's terms of trade and customs procedures, particularly in Northern Ireland, would require over a year for businesses and government bodies to implement. Nonetheless, there is a significant risk that Mr Johnson will not request an extension, leaving businesses and government bodies with insufficient time to prepare for an orderly exit at end-2020.
The Italian government will be unstable and will not last a full term
Political stability in Italy has improved since the formation in late August 2019 of a new coalition government led by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and comprising the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the centre-left, pro-European Partito Democratico (PD). M5S and the PD used to be fierce political opponents, but unexpectedly put aside their differences to prevent a snap general election following the collapse of Mr Conte's previous govern-ment in early August. The collapse occured when M5S's former coalition partner, the right-wing Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, withdrew from the coalition to try to engineer an early election in order to turn its surge in electoral support into seats in parliament, where it is only the third-largest party, behind M5S and the PD.
We believe that the new Conte government is unlikely to last until the end of the parliamentary term in 2023, but will hold together for 12-18 months. Political instability will remain a feature of Italian politics, especially since the coalition commands a tight majority in the Senate (the upper house of parliament). Nonetheless, with the Lega continuing to top opinion polls, we expect the second Conte government to cling on to power for as long as possible, as both the governing M5S and the PD would fear defeat in a general election.
Turkey has completed its transition towards one-man rule
In Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected in mid-2018 as president for a second term in the first round of a snap election, and the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), in an election that was mostly free, but largely unfair.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers with little oversight (including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary) and has abolished the role of prime minister. This greatly curtails the role of parliament.
We expect the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in mid-2016, to remain in power until 2023. Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered a clear blow to their credibility when the opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, increased his margin of victory over Binali Yildirim of the ruling coalition in the Istanbul mayoral election rerun at the end of June 2019. However, Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on political dissent to maintain his dominance of Turkish politics in the coming years.
Security risk remains high. Attacks by Islamic State (IS) and the independence conflict being waged by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) pose a constant risk. Turkey's incursion in October 2019 into the north-east of Syria to remove the main Kurdish group from that region has increased the risk of PKK violence.
The transition to a post-Putin Russia has led to greater political jockeying
In March 2018 the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was comfortably re-elected for a fourth term, which runs until 2024. Mr Putin's re-election itself was a non-event, given his high approval ratings and the absence of credible opposition candidates. As a result we expect broad continuity in his policy agenda, which focuses on "conservative cultural values", an authoritarian political culture and overt anti-Westernism. We also expect a renewed focus on domestic policy in an effort to arrest the current decline in living standards and bolster growth. Despite occasional pro-market rhetoric, economic policy will remain statist, nationalist and protectionist. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a priority.
However, given how heavily the political system relies on Mr Putin's charismatic leadership and popularity, attention will gradually shift to how he will manage an eventual presidential transition, assuming that he stands down at the end of his term (our core forecast). This risks ushering in a period of political un-certainty as various factions of the elite jockey to secure their positions in the post-Putin political order. The transition will result in great uncertainty owing to the weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the personalised and opaque governance system around Mr Putin.
Russia's ambition to bolster its credentials as a major regional and inter----national player will continue to shape its foreign policy. Its influence will be strengthened by the conclusion of international deals in strategic sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear power plants and military equipment.
The CIS region will be mostly stable
We do not expect political or economic upheaval in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the near term. The exceptions to this are Uzbekistan, where the new president will continue to pursue a reformist course, and Armenia and Georgia, where street protests in 2018 led to a change in government, and where economic growth will outpace that of most other countries in the region. Kazakhstan will undergo a managed political transition, after Kassym-Jomart Tokayev (the chosen successor to Nursultan Nazarbayev) won a landslide victory in the June 2019 presidential election. We believe that no significant political or economic change will take place in the other central Asian countries (the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan).
Political outlook: Election watch
General elections across Europe since 2017 have confirmed rising disaffection with the political establishment, which has been reflected in the decline of the two-party system and the rise of insurgent populist parties. Increasing political fragmentation across the region has resulted in a more complicated policy-making outlook, but has also made forming governments more difficult and given rise to some unusual coalitions.
Awkward coalitions are becoming a recurrent feature in Austria
Austria provides one example of this. Following the expulsion in May 2019 of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), the then chancellor and leader of the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP), Sebastian Kurz, lost a vote of no confidence, supported by the Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the FPÖ. This led to the appointment of a placeholder government until an early election in September. The ÖVP emerged as the largest party from the election, after campaigning on a more hardline policy towards migration and integration. However, the party does not have enough support to govern alone, requiring another coalition. We expect the Greens to enter government for the first time as the ÖVP's coalition partner, owing to good personal relations between the two parties' leadership. However, there is limited policy overlap, which could stymie a coalition deal.
A repeat election in Spain failed to solve the problems posed by fragmentation
The repeat election in Spain delivered another fragmented parliament. The PSOE, led by Mr Sánchez, won the most votes at the general election on November 10th, but its share of the vote fell to 28%, from 28.7% at the April election. The election confirmed the emergence of far-right Vox at the national level, as the party saw its vote share surge from 10.3% to 15.1%, making it the third-largest party in parliament. Vox was buoyed largely by concerns about the rise of the pro-independence movement in Catalonia, after weeks of riots following the jailing of nine secessionist leaders, and the collapse in support for the market-friendly Ciudadanos (Citizens), which obtained 6.8% of the vote, compared with 15.9% in April. We expect the PSOE to form a minority government either in coalition with the far-left Unidas Podemos (UP) and the support of Catalan separatist parties, or with the support of a number of right-wing parties. Another repeat election in 2020 is unlikely given the political cost for all parties.
Fine Gael minority coalition in Ireland will not survive a full term
The Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland does not have the capacity or cohesion to address the mounting economic and political chal-lenges in the country effectively, and our view remains that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021. We currently expect a snap election to take place in spring 2020-although we do not expect this to produce a government any more stable or effective than the current coalition. The administration-led by the taoiseach (prime minister), Leo Varadkar-relies on the support of a disparate group of independent members of parliament (MPs), and a three-year "confidence and supply" agreement between Fine Gael and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. The agreement with Fianna Fail was exten-ded in December, as neither Mr Varadkar nor Micheal Martin, the leader of Fianna Fail, was willing to trigger an early election while there was still great uncertainty regarding Brexit. However, both Mr Martin and Mr Varadar have expressed their desire for a spring election, and so we expect an election to take place in April or May.

Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt rows between EU members has fallen sharply since 2016, in the context of an economic recovery across the bloc in 2016-18. The European Central Bank (ECB) has overcome objections in a number of countries-notably Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, political leaders have not used the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing (QE) to bolster the economic recovery and have failed to reach a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. There were fears that one or some euro zone countries might exit the bloc during the financial crisis. However, this scenario now seems unlikely, and the financial stability of the bloc looks strong, despite the high public debt levels of some south European countries (such as Greece, which exited its bail-out programme in August 2018, and Italy).
Italy's relations with the EU will continue to improve
Italy's relations with the EU and its main European partners have improved since the formation of a government including the centre-left, pro-European PD in late August 2019. We expect the new PD-M5S government coalition to be less confrontational towards EU rules on migration and fiscal policy than the previous administration. It remains to be seen what Mr Conte can realistically achieve regarding his government's demands for a revision of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact in favour of economic growth-friendly policies, and a review of the Dublin Regulation to ensure burden-sharing among member states in dealing with migrants seeking asylum in the EU. The prospect of obtaining some concessions on the fiscal front is better than the chance of winning concessions on the highly divisive migration issue.
Hungary and Poland will continue to clash with the EU over illiberal policies
The nationalist, socially conservative governments in Hungary and Poland have come into conflict with the EU over the EU's refugee-relocation policy and also over the creation of what the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has called-in reference to his own country-an "illiberal" state. In addition to refusing to take their allocation of refugees, the Hungarian and Polish govern-ments have curbed the independence of the judiciary, imposed government control over the public-service media and clamped down on civil-society groups. The Commission has referred several of these measures to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), but has so far struggled to find an effective response. Steps taken by the Commission and the European Parliament since December 2017 to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, possibly resulting in the suspension of a member country's voting rights, are unlikely to succeed, as they require the unanimous vote of all members, and Hungary and Poland have made clear that they would support one another in such an event.
Turkey's foreign policy with the EU and US will be increasingly confrontational
Turkey's relationships with the EU and the US have shifted under the AKP since the early 2000s. Declining trust in the US and the EU, and an ambition to make Turkey a regional power have all incentivised the AKP to pursue a "Turkey first" approach to foreign policy. By putting its interests first, the country has started to establish transactional co-operation with countries with which it was previously a rival or had limited relations, such as Russia and China. On the downside, Turkey's foreign policy will leave the country strategically isolated, and Turkey's relationship with the US will become increasingly transactional.
The deep distrust between Turkey and the US has increased since the early 2000s, making this scepticism more entrenched and harder to reverse. The watershed moment was the failed military coup by part of the Turkish military in 2016 and a perceived lack of Western solidarity in its aftermath. The sub-sequent resistance of the US to extradite a self-exiled Turkish imam, Fethullah Gulen, from the US for his alleged role in the failed coup further fanned the flames of anti-US sentiment in Turkey. Prior to the coup attempt both countries had already clashed on several issues, including the collaboration of the US with Iraqi and Syrian Kurds.
Turkey-US relations reached new lows in early 2019 when Turkey bought Russian military equipment (an S-400 air-defence system) that is not inter-operable with NATO standards. We expect that Turkey will activate the missile-defence system in April 2020, which is likely to result in US sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. However, sanctions will lean towards the less onerous side to avoid pushing Turkey fully into Russia's orbit and to ensure a degree of collaboration on other issues. Turkey's incursion in north-eastern Syria in October has further raised tensions with the US and the EU. The operation has been successful so far. After reaching an agreement with Russia (one of the main Syrian regime backers), Turkey has managed to disrupt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds who were seeking to estab-lish an autonomous region along Turkey's south-eastern border. The government has also provided a narrative to counter the growing hostility among Turks towards Syrian refugees, who are perceived as putting strain on the economy. The operation in Syria is the most recent example of a closer collaboration between Russia and Turkey. In the near term we do not expect the operation to lead to the imposition of new sanctions on Turkey from the US, for fear of Turkey further deepening ties with Russia. However, we do expect a further estrangement between Turkey and the US.
Russia-West tensions are at their highest level since the cold war
Political tensions between Russia and the West are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Western countries have accused Russia of financing extremist opposition parties in western Europe, employing cyber-warfare against Western targets and engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West. Meanwhile, Russia is seeking to reassert its role on the global stage, as recently highlighted by Russia's mediation efforts following Turkey's incursion into northern Syria, which further en-hanced Russia's role as the main power broker in the regional conflict. Russia is also dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in 2015, and its subsequent breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Donbas conflict, which started in the same year, served Russia's objective of preventing Ukraine from becoming more closely integrated with NATO and the EU. In response, the EU and the US imposed sanctions on Russian officials, and the financial, energy and defence sectors. We expect these sanctions to remain in place over the medium term, and it is likely that the US sanctions will be expanded further.
Progress has resumed in the dialogue between Russia and Ukraine
After years of low-intensity conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia backs separatist rebels in the Donbas region, some significant developments have taken place. Dialogue between Russia and Ukraine resumed in mid-July, the demilitarisation process is making progress and the first meeting of the Normandy Four-comprising the heads of state of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine-in more than three years will take place on December 9th in Paris. There is still a long way to go for a peace settlement to be reached between both parties, especially with regards to the future status of the Donbas region, and we do not expect any major breakthrough to be made during the meeting. That said, Mr Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyi-the Ukrainian president-and Mr Macron are all keen to show progress on the foreign policy front to boost their support domestically and improve their status on the global scene. Therefore, we expect negotiations to continue and a compromise between Ukraine and Russia to be reached within our forecast period-although low-level conflict will continue.
The EU has labelled China a systemic rival, and the BRI divides opinion
The EU has labelled China a "systemic rival" and has adopted a regulation setting up a framework to scrutinise foreign investments from non-EU countries, a move that is widely understood to be directed towards foreign direct investment from China. Although the EU supports improving connectivity between Europe and Asia (as pointed out in the EU Connectivity Strategy), it has not formally come out in support of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-China's flagship foreign policy initiative that aims to create a "New Silk Road" of trading routes and to expand China's economic and diplomatic ties. However, despite the EU's reluctance to support the BRI, several European countries have signed up to it, including Italy, Portugal, Greece and several countries in the western Balkans.
One of the points of concern for the EU regarding the BRI is the near monopoly that Chinese companies enjoy in implementing these projects. Until trans-parency regarding the terms of BRI funding improves and the procurement processes are made more inclusive and competitive (allowing for participation from European companies), the EU is unlikely to change its stance on the BRI.
Macroeconomic policy
The Franco-German axis will drive fowards some euro zone reform plans
The commitment in 2012 by the then-president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning-point for the bloc. In 2017 EU leaders renewed their push for further integration of the economic and monetary union to boost the bloc's resilience to future shocks, and in June 2018 Germany and France presented a shared set of proposals. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects progress to remain patchy.
We do not expect the emergence of the type of full fiscal integration that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been pushing for, but the strength of the Franco-German axis, with support from a number of southern member states, is likely to be sufficient to lead to a relatively ambitious set of reforms, which will nevertheless take several years to implement fully. These would include reform of the current bail-out fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which could be turned into something akin to a version of the IMF. Such a move could shift the responsibility for fiscal and economic monitoring of member states away from the European Commission to the revised ESM, and include restructuring of sovereign debt as a strict conditionality in any bail-out. One of the three pillars of the banking union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which has yet to be implemented, will continue to meet political resistance from several north European member states. The planned EDIS would increase the responsibility of healthy economies for bad debts in others.
Future-proofing the EU's industrial strategy is a priority
Industrial strategy is receiving more attention, as the EU has realised that it risks being left behind by innovations in the US and China, and the rising pace of technological disruption. After the Commission decided in February to block the planned mega-merger between two train manufacturers-Alstom (France) and Siemens (Germany)-over competition concerns, there was push-back from both France and Germany. Proposals to revamp EU competition policy to allow the creation of regional champions capable of competing with Chinese state-owned rivals (for example) have made little progress so far. However, the new French commissioner for the single market, industrial policy, defence and space, Thierry Breton, can be expected to spar with Margrethe Vestager, the com-missioner for com-petition, on this issue. Greater investment into artificial intelligence, electric car batteries and digital innovation will be a priority under the new Commission, with plans to develop in these areas already under way. Further proposals for EU reform-such as strengthening the EU's defence capabilities, owing to concerns about NATO's reliability-will prove more controversial.
Talks over the EU's next seven-year budgetary framework will be tough
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 have emerged in the second half of 2019. The most contentious issue is the Commission's proposal to increase member states' financial contributions to meet the shortfall created by the withdrawal of the UK-a major net contributor. Although some southern and eastern member states are willing to contribute more, fiscally hawkish countries-namely Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, and Denmark-oppose this. Another point of controversy is the Commission's proposed cuts to the EU's common agricultural policy (which essentially provides subsidies for farms) and spending on regional development to finance new policy priorities such as climate change, security and migration. East European countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, which could lose up to 25% of their EU funds if these changes were implemented, strongly oppose these cuts. Another contentious issue is conditionality in the next budget cycle, linking the transfer of funds to rule-of-law compliance. This idea emerged in response to the illiberal drift in countries such as Poland and Hungary, and has created an east-west split. The EU multi-annual budget requires unanimous approval at the European Council and an absolute majority in the European Parliament. There has not been much progress in negotiations on the 2021-27 budget so far, but EU leaders will be under pressure to reach an agreement by end-2020 to avoid a rollover of the current budget.
The 2021-27 budget will also include a new, small euro zone budget, after a compromise was reached between France and Germany. Far from providing a fiscal stabilisation function-as favoured by Mr Macron-the euro zone budget will instead be channelled to countries looking to improve competitiveness and convergence. The topic has proved contentious among the so-called New Hanseatic League, a group of fiscally hawkish Nordic and Baltic countries led by the Netherlands.

Fiscal policy will play a minor role in 2020, despite the economic slowdown
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. Monetary policy looks set to remain as the main macroeconomic policy tool, particularly after the ECB presented a substantial easing package on September 12th. This includes a cut to the deposit rate (to -0.5%, from -0.4% previously), enhanced forward guidance, another round of quantitative easing (QE2) and the introduction of a tiered deposit system, in order to dampen the hit to banks' profitability from negative interest rates.
Although most European countries have substantially reduced their budget deficits compared with 2009, improved fiscal positions since 2015 have largely been the result of an economic recovery, which has generated sizeable revenue windfalls, and of lower debt-servicing costs following the policy measures taken by the ECB. Fiscal consolidation across the EU has, however, lost momen-tum, and many member states still have sizeable fiscal imbalances.
The average euro zone government debt/GDP ratio was 87.2% at end-2018, and Belgium, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal all had ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the zone for many years, even more so in the current environment of low growth and muted inflation.
Against a worsened economic outlook, a mildly expansionary fiscal stance in 2020 will provide limited support to growth. A larger fiscal loosening, although desirable, remains off the agenda. Member states that wish to boost public spending lack the fiscal space to do so, while member states with abundant fiscal space lack the need-or the will, in case of Germany-to use it. EU and national fiscal rules also require high-debt member states to further reduce their structural deficits.
A greater loosening of fiscal policy in the coming period remains unlikely. Developments in Germany could alter the dynamics of the political debate in Europe about fiscal discipline, but despite a substantial economic slowdown, the German government has not yet felt any pressure to deviate from its "schwarze Null" policy (a commitment to avoiding budget deficits). A more protracted downturn could change the political calculus in Germany, but this is not our central forecast.
Italy will continue to test EU fiscal rules
The tone of recent discussions between Italy's new pro-EU government and the Commission has been much more co-operative than in 2018. The previous Italian government, which included the Eurosceptic, far-right Lega, mounted a serious challenge to euro area fiscal rules, proposing an expansionary 2019 budget that the Commission regarded as violating the debt-reduction criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). A protracted stand-off between the government and the Com-mission followed, unnerving financial markets and pushing up Italy's borrowing costs. The administration eventually reached a compromise with the EU institutions on a deficit target of 2% of GDP in 2019.
The Italian government's fiscal plan envisages a budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 2020, unchanged from its latest estimate for 2019, narrowing to 1.8% and 1.4% of GDP in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The Commission has warned the Italian government about its "slightly expansionary" fiscal stance in 2020, stating that it is at risk of non-compliance with EU debt-reduction targets. However, the Commission has not taken any immediate action, deferring any further steps to spring 2020, when the country's fiscal plans will be reviewed. We believe the government fiscal targets to be overly optimistic, and expect the fiscal deficit to average 2.5% in 2020-21, before narrowing slightly thereafter. Public debt was almost 135% of GDP at end-2018, and we expect it to rise in 2020 before declining only marginally, to about 134%, by end-2024.
The UK government has shifted towards a looser fiscal stance
In the UK, fiscal policy was relaxed modestly in 2019 after a period of austerity from 2010-18 in which real government spending grew by an annual average of 0.9%. The Conservatives have pledged further spending increases in 2020 and beyond. In his annual spending review, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, promised more than £13.8bn in additional expenditure across all government departments, concentrated in health, education and police. On top of those commitments, the Conservative manifesto commits to an additional £2.9bn in current spending by 2024, and to raising the cap on borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%. We expect that this fiscal easing, combined with continued economic uncertainty, will result in a deficit equivalent to 2.6% of GDP in 2020, following an estimated deficit of 2% in 2019. We expect the deficit to average 2.5% of GDP in 2021-24, spiking in 2022 and 2023 as increased trade barriers with the EU slow growth. We expect public debt to remain relatively constant over the forecast period, at about 83%.
Fiscal performance in central Europe will worsen modestly as growth slows
A slowdown in real GDP growth across the region, coupled with increasing government expenditure means that fiscal performance will worsen in central European countries in the 2020-24 forecast period. We expect narrow deficits of less than 1% of GDP in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2020-24. However, the Slovak government has not prioritised achieving a balanced budget, and ahead of the parliamentary election in February 2020 we expect the government to ramp up spending. In Hungary we expect the fiscal deficit to average about 2% of GDP in the forecast period, largely unchanged from 2015-19, and in Poland we expect the deficit to widen to about 2.5% of GDP by 2024. Public debt, which is equivalent to 50% or less of GDP in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia-but is about 70% of GDP in Hungary. Given Hungary's high public debt, the country's fiscal position and currency will remain vulnerable to volatility on world markets.
Higher oil prices are easing fiscal constraints in Russia
The tight budget constraints facing Russia's government are abating owing to higher global oil prices. We expect international oil prices to average US$69.2/barrel in 2020-24, up from an average of about US$55.5/b in 2015-18. The Ministry of Finance intends to relax fiscal policy slightly in 2020-22, but fiscal stability will remain a central objective, which will ensure budget surpluses and growth in sovereign reserves. Spending related to the "National Projects"-the government's plans for infrastructure modern-isation-will push up expenditure. Military spending will remain high as well, but some spending will be redirected towards health and education, as recently promised by the president, Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile higher global oil prices-and the government's conservative oil price forecasts (retaining a US$40/b oil price assumption)-almost guarantee that revenue will outperform expec-tations. We expect that the budget, which returned to surplus in 2018, will not dip under 1% of GDP in 2020-24.
Turkey's fiscal position looks relatively solid
The public finances have traditionally been one of Turkey's most reassuring economic features. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past.
After substantial fiscal stimulus, we estimate that the budget deficit will widen from 2% in 2018 to 3% of GDP in 2019, remaining around this size in 2020-22 in line with the government's preference for fast growth reflected in its medium-term programme. The deficit will remain large in 2023-with the shortfall reaching about 2.8%, owing to the presidential and parliam-entary elections that year-before narrowing to 2.1% of GDP in 2024. Public debt will remain at about 30% of GDP in the forecast period.
Macroeconomic policy: Monetary policy and exchange rates
Interest rates (av; %) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Euribor -0.4 -0.4 -0.4 -0.4 -0.2 0.0
US$ 3-month commercial paper rate 2.1 1.5 1.5 1.8 2.2 2.3
US 10-year government bond yield 2.1 1.5 1.7 2.2 2.6 2.7
10-year German government bond yield -0.2 -0.2 0.3 0.8 1.2 1.5
The ECB adopted a loose monetary policy in response to the European sover-eign debt crisis that began in 2011. Interest rate cuts were followed by the introduction of a quantitative easing (QE) programme in 2015-18. However, economic growth in the euro zone started to slow in early 2018 on the back of an industrial downturn triggered by both weaker foreign demand and dis-ruptions to the auto industry. Growth has remained weak, and headline and core inflation have failed to pick up to the target set by the ECB of "close to, but below, 2%". Against this background, the ECB announced a bold package at its September 2019 meeting, which involved a cut to the deposit rate (from -0.4% to -0.5%); the start of an open-ended QE programme, which will run at a monthly pace of EUR20bn; stronger communication on the forward guidance on interest rates; the introduction of a tiered deposit system; and more favourable terms for long-term loans to commercial banks.
The second round of quantitative easing will run until late 2021
We expect the September policy package to be maintained in the medium term. The second round of QE should run until late 2021, and a small increase in the deposit rate will come in 2022 as the trade outlook improves and inflationary pressures build. Christine Lagarde, the new ECB president, will face pressures to reverse part of the package, but we deem this to be unlikely. Ms Lagarde is instead likely to announce the ECB strategic review-the first to be conducted in 16 years-at the Bank's December meeting. We do not expect the review to result in a significant overhaul to the ECB's strategy. However, we do expect a change to the inflation target, which will become symmetrical around 2%, instead of "below, but close to, 2%", as at present.
The BoE will set monetary policy according to Brexit developments
Decisions made by the Bank of England (BoE, the UK's central bank) in 2020-24 will depend heavily on the degree of volatility in both prices and demand created by Brexit implementation. On November 7th the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the BoE kept the policy interest rate unchanged, at 0.75%, where it has been since August 2018. However, two members of the MPC supported an immediate rate cut, citing the accelerated timetable for leaving the single market and slowing global growth. Although the BoE has been wary of cutting rates, in order to retain monetary policy space for a potential disorderly Brexit, this split decision has led us to believe that the BoE will cut rates once in 2020 to combat uncertainty related to negotiations with the EU and slowing growth. We anticipate that once Brexit uncertainty dissipates in 2021, the BoE will tighten rates to regain policy space, but will have to undertake a more accommodative monetary policy at the end of 2022 owing to the supply shock created by leaving the single market, cutting rates to 0.25%. We expect the BoE to maintain this accommodative policy until 2024, when it will begin tightening again.
Turkey still faces a risk of another sharp depreciation of the lira
Turkey's currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession have put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets. After the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August 2018, the Central Bank of Turkey raised its main policy rate to 24%, from 17.75% previously. Since then the lira has recovered and annual consumer price inflation has started to ease. Meanwhile, major central banks have been loosening monetary policy. Under these conditions, the MPC of the Central Bank of Turkey slashed the bank's main policy rate-the one week repo lending rate-to 19.75% in July, 16.5% in September, 14% in October and 12% in December.
We expect further rate cuts in 2020. However, we expect the cuts to become smaller and more gradual. Further substantial rate reductions could undermine the lira and pose upside risks to the annual inflation rate. The rate cuts reflect the government's continued pro-growth stance and pressure on the central bank to keep nominal rates below what would credibly be required to reach its inflation target. This rate forecast implies that the real policy rate will be close to zero in the second half of 2020. Tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) in 2021 and still-high inflation in Turkey will cause the central bank to raise rates again in that year. Thereafter, in 2022-24, we expect gradual cuts alongside moderating inflation.
In 2020 we expect volatility in the lira to continue, but we anticipate reduced downward-value directionality for the lira and forecast a more moderate depreciation, of 1.8%. An accommodative monetary policy stance in advanced economies will partially offset the downward effect on the lira's value that stems from tensions with the US. In 2021-24 still-high inflation, a large current-account deficit and an inadequate monetary policy stance will result in gradual depreciation of the lira in nominal terms.
Russia is operating an accommodative monetary policy to boost demand
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR, the central bank) cut its policy rate five times in 2019, to 6.25% in December. This reflected the weakness of domestic demand and a significant downward revision to official 2019 year-end inflation forecasts, which prompted the largest rate cut in two years (by 50 basis points) in October. Any downward shock to global oil prices or new stringent sanctions on Russia would prompt the CBR to tighten policy quickly to soften the resulting depreciation of the Russian currency against the US dollar.
Many currencies in eastern Europe remain pegged to the euro
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of the Fed and the ECB's policy trajectory. However, we do not believe that there are significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in North Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a cause for concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of strong tourism performance, have eased these concerns.
We expect broadly accommodative monetary policy stances in Central Asia
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015, as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, only Kazakhstan has allowed its currency to float. Given Kazakhstan's trade ties to the Russian economy, it would lose competitiveness if the tenge appreciated significantly against the rouble. Azerbaijan appears to have returned to a US dollar peg since April 2017. The monetary policy stances of oil-exporting countries, such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, are closely linked to oil price fluctuations, as the exchange-rate movements of these countries are closely linked to global oil prices (which determine export earnings). With global oil prices expected to remain firm in our forecast period, these countries will maintain an accommodative monetary policy, which will also support domestic economic growth.

The external environment will hold back growth in Europe in 2020
Economic growth in the euro zone was robust in 2015-17, but slowed in 2018 as the external environment became less supportive. Slower growth in China, weakness in major trading partners such as the UK and Turkey, and the US-China trade war were the main drivers of the slowdown, which was further amplified this year by a global slump in the automotive sector and a cyclical downturn in consumer electronics. The export-oriented German economy, with its large industrial sector and automotive industry, has been particularly badly affected, contracting slightly in the second quarter of 2019. The Italian economy is also stalling, dampened by domestic policy uncertainty as well as slowing external demand. Both economies will face further headwinds in 2020. How-ever, the economic prospects of other big economies are brighter: in Spain and France growth momentum remains strong.
Overall, the picture is of a difficult external environment, which is weighing on exports, while domestic demand continues to expand at a healthy pace. Labour markets remain tight and wage growth is holding up. House prices are rising, leading to positive wealth effects, and inflation has softened. The exceptionally loose monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank (ECB) is supporting growth, and some countries-such as France and the Netherlands-are con-ducting fiscal stimulus programmes as well. Meanwhile, high capacity utilisation rates, especially in the construction sector, are encouraging invest-ment, although prevailing uncertainty (around the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit and additional US tariffs on EU goods and services, in particular) will keep business sentiment and investment growth contained in the short term.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects global trade growth to start to improve in 2020 as the automotive industry sees a modest recovery and electronics trade volumes bounce back. However, the majority of the uptick in exports will come from non-OECD countries, so the impact on exporters in Europe will be limited, especially given still-slowing growth in the US and Chinese economies. We expect economic growth in Europe to remain constrained in 2020, but to strengthen from 2021 as the external context improves more robustly.
The German economy is struggling with weak external demand
The German economy has been slowing since a recent peak in 2017, and the economy contracted marginally in the second quarter of 2019, before returning to growth in the third quarter, dispelling fears of a recession. The main driver of the German slowdown was external, and we believe that there were three main aspects to this. First, there has been a noticeable slowdown in German exports to China, in line with slowing Chinese economic growth and the US-China trade war. Second, German exports to other significant trading partners, such as the UK, Sweden and Turkey, have been dampened by weak demand over the past year. Third, the automotive sector is facing a number of challenges. Global car sales fell in 2019, reflecting slowing demand in China and India, and at the same time structural shifts-including the decline of diesel and rise of e-mobility-are disrupting the industry.
We expect growth in Germany to remain subdued until 2021, when the external environment will become more supportive. That said, Germany's domestic economic fundamentals remain strong, and the main driver of growth over the medium term will be private consumption, with investment also contributing robustly. The government has agreed on a more expansionary fiscal policy in 2020 and 2021, and may be pushed by political pressures into spending more. Discussion about whether the government's commitment to maintaining a balanced budget remains appropriate has intensified, but we do not expect a shift in stance on this question.
Growth will remain comparatively strong in France, in a European context
Growth in France has also slowed since 2017, when the cyclical upswing in the euro zone reached its peak. Nonetheless, growth in 2019 has been robust in a European context-particularly compared with Germany and Italy. This partly reflects the larger share of domestic demand in the economy: exports are equivalent to about 30% of GDP in France, versus almost 50% in Germany. It also reflects the fiscal stimulus enacted over the past year; the government responded to the "Gilets Jaunes" protesters in late 2018 with measures to sup-port purchasing power. The government's reform agenda has been slowed down by these protests and by a new surge of industrial action at the end of 2019, but we nonetheless expect a continued gradual improvement in the business environment, especially the tax system and the labour market, in the second half of the government's term. We expect the economy to grow by a similar rate in 2020 as in 2019, and to pick up more robustly from 2021 as the external environment improves and supply side reforms continue to bear fruit.
Italy's growth has been stagnating since mid-2018
Real GDP growth in Italy has essentially been stagnating since mid-2018, dampened by domestic political and economic uncertainty, as well as global trade tensions. Following mild contractions in the second and third quarters of 2018, real GDP increased by just 0.1% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of last year and in each of the first three quarters of 2019. We forecast that economic growth will pick up only moderately, from an estimated 0.2% year on year in 2019 t0 0.4% in 2020, owing to stronger internal demand and a recovery in industrial production. From 2021 to 2024 we expect a respectable growth performance by Italian standards, but it will still be weak in the context of other euro area economies, as structural rigidities, a high level of sovereign debt, clogged credit channels and policy uncertainty will continue to exert a drag on growth.
Structural reforms have improved the context for growth in Spain
In Spain, a combination of reform and austerity has improved the context for growth since 2014. The financial sector is now in a better position owing to reforms undertaken as part of Spain's EUR41.3bn bank bail­out process. A landmark labour market reform was implemented in 2012. This lowered dismissal costs, clarified and narrowed the definition of unfair dismissal, reduced the collective bargaining power of trade unions, and made it easier for companies to cut wages and working hours. Structural reform will proceed at a more gradual pace in 2020-24 (the forecast period) compared with the reform-intense period under the absolute majority of the People's Party (PP) in 2011-15. Under the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the Congress of Deputies (the lower house of parliament) will be dominated by the left of centre for the first time since the 2008-11 legislature. In these circumstances, policymaking will tack to the left. In 2019 the PSOE unfroze public pension revaluations and substantially increased the minimum wage using powers of decree. In January 2019 the minimum wage rose by 22%, to EUR900 per month, and the government also approved a 2.3% rise in public­sector salaries, effective from January 1st. Real GDP growth has decelerated since 2015, as the economic recovery has matured. In 2020-24 we expect this gradual slowdown to continue towards the economy's potential growth rate.
The recovery in Greece remains fragile, with political instability a central risk
Greece exited its third bail-out programme in August 2018, but we are sceptical that the country will experience rapid and sustained growth. Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter, government con-sumption by almost a quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Under-investment during the economic crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term. After estimated growth of 1.9% in 2019, we forecast that real GDP will grow by an average of 2.2% per year in 2020-24. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and com-petitive-ness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political and financial market instability.
The UK economy is suffering from the uncertainty stemming from Brexit
Growth in the UK since the Brexit referendum has been driven by private consumption-supported by real wage growth, which reached post-crisis highs in 2019-and an estimated unemployment rate of 3.8% this year. However, employment growth stalled in 2019, as the economy is already near full employment, and productivity growth remains low. Further growth in private consumption will be constrained, particularly in 2022 and 2023, before re-bounding in 2024 as Brexit uncertainty decreases. Additionally, we expect only modest increases in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), bolstered by loose fiscal policy, but offset by a deterioration in the external sector and limited growth in the consumer sector. We expect real GDP growth to remain subdued, at 1.3% in 2019 and 2020. Once there is greater clarity over the future relation-ship between the UK and EU, we expect GDP growth to rebound, before declining again as the UK loses access to the single market.

The Visegrad countries will continue to post above-average growth rates
Central Europe, particularly the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), will register real GDP growth well above the EU average in 2020-24. However, growth will decline in the forecast period compared with recent years, driven in part by the slowdown in the global automotive market. Furthermore, most central European economies are deeply entrenched in German supply chains, especially in the automotive sector, and so Germany's performance will have a knock-on effect on overall economic per-for-mance in the region. Nonetheless, increasing employment and soaring wages in the Visegrads will continue to fuel private consum-ption in the fore-cast period. A recovery in global trade from 2020 onwards will support overall eco-nomic growth in central Europe in 2020-24. In the longer term, much of central Europe will face a challenging environment, given the poor demographic outlook.
Economic activity accelerated in south-eastern Europe, but is now moderating
In south-eastern Europe economic recovery is continuing, although growth has generally lost momentum. In the region's largest economy, Romania, we expect growth to slow from an estimated 3.8% in 2019 to a still-strong 2.9% in 2020. In both years growth will be supported by private consumption and, to a lesser extent, exports and fixed investment. We expect that real wages will continue to grow robustly, and that real credit expansion will support growth in consumer spending. With a general election in 2020, the government will maintain an overall broadly accommodative stance, particularly regarding household spending. We expect fixed investment growth to decelerate sharply in 2020, after double-digit growth in 2019. In Bulgaria, a recovery in domestic credit growth, a strengthening labour market and firmer real wage growth have underpinned the acceleration of economic growth in recent years. We forecast that annual real GDP growth will average 3% per year in 2020-24, compared with an estimated 3.8% in 2019, reflecting less favourable global conditions and labour capacity constraints.
Structural imbalances in the western Balkans have been largely corrected
Economic activity in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) broadly picked up in 2015-18, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors, such as low oil prices in 2015-16 and a strong pick-up in demand from the euro zone in 2017. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the western Balkans should benefit from the structural reforms that are now in progress in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. Political cronyism, corruption, vested interests and a poor demographic profile are also a drag on growth across the region. We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans of about 3.3% in 2020-24.
We expect the Turkish economy to grow above its potential rate in 2020-24
In Turkey government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate sharply in 2017, but this surge exacerbated internal and external discrepancies. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredict-ability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short--term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira depreciating by about 24% on average against the US dollar in 2018.
The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018. In 2019 we estimate that real GDP will have grown by only 0.1%, as a result of base effects arising from the economic recession in the second half of 2018. In 2020-24 we expect annual average growth of 3.7% as the government attempts to meet its annual growth target of 5%. This growth rate will be above a potential real GDP growth rate of about 3%. With the government consistently pushing economic growth above potential growth, there is a risk of a significant loss of investor confidence at some point in 2020-24.
Growth in Russia will pick up slowly after a particularly weak 2019
We estimate that real GDP growth in Russia slowed sharply in 2019. This was mostly due to a fall in household spending following an increase in value-added tax (VAT). However, a dip in global oil prices and low investment also played a role as major infrastructure-construction projects related to the 2018 World Cup were completed and implementation of the so-called National Projects-the president's blue-print for his fourth presidential term to 2024-was slow. Growth will pick up slowly in 2020, as the National Projects have now been made a priority in the 2020 draft federal budget, which should support activity in the industrial and construction sectors. However, we expect the projects to gain traction only slowly. Growth in household consumption will slow in 2020, as the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) introduced tighter prudential requirements in October 2019, which will reduce unsecured lending. Weaker foreign demand growth and a dip in global oil prices mean that export receipts will also remain soft. International sanctions, and broader political and business uncertainty will remain significant constraints on investment, as will the lack of a "culture of failure" (the absence of entrepreneurial spirit weighs heavily on innovation and investment). In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low prod-uctivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth to an annual average of 1.7% in 2020-24.
Faster than expected progress on structural reforms represents an upside risk in Ukraine
Real GDP fell by a cumulative 16.4% in Ukraine in 2014-15 amid conflict and a chaotic political situation. The disruption of these years accentuated a structural change in the Ukrainian economy away from heavy industry and towards agriculture. The economy has been recovering since 2016, driven by vigorous growth in private investment and private consumption. We estimate that economic growth will have remained strong in 2019, as rising wages and solid growth in capital investment will have supported domestic demand.
In 2020-24 we expect household consumption to drive growth. Private con-sumption growth will soften gradually in the forecast period, while remaining strong owing to high inflows of remittances from abroad, and higher wages and pensions (especially in the first half of the forecast period). Improving global conditions in 2021-24 will increase the contribution of the external sector to GDP growth. Faster than expected progress on structural reforms could improve investment and represents an upside risk to our growth outlook. A downside risk stems from the possible abrupt end of Russian gas transit through Ukraine on January 1st 2020, when the current transit contract expires (although we expect Ukraine and Russia to sign a short-term agreement covering gas supplies in 2020).
Growth rates in the CIS will be similar in 2019 to those recorded in 2018
Growth and exchange-rate movements in the Commonwealth of Indep-endent States (CIS) are highly correlated to movements in global oil prices, especially in large oil exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Owing to important trade links and high levels of remittance flows, the performance of the Russian economy has an impact on that of smaller countries in Central Asia (especially the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) and the South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia, not CIS members). Given our forecast for an oil price corridor of about US$60-75/barrel in 2020-24, the growth outlook for most countries is unlikely to diverge significantly from their 2019 final outturn.

Price pressures have weakened in 2019 across the euro zone on the back of softer economic momentum and lower global energy prices. As a result, headline inflation in the euro zone decelerated from 1.7% in 2018 to an estimated 1.2% in 2019. In 2020 price growth will pick up only slightly, to 1.3%, as global energy prices remain broadly stable and wage growth fails to pick up. Capacity constraints have eased in the bloc's industrial sectors and employ-ment growth is slowing down. Nevertheless, still resilient domestic demand should ensure that price growth remains decent in 2020, albeit well below the ECB's target of "close to, but below, 2%". Inflation will pick up more pronouncedly in 2021-24, averaging 1.8% per year. This will reflect both higher wage pressures as the trade outlook improves and a rise in global energy prices.

Business environment rankings cover 82 countries
The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of 11 categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into 11 categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2015-19) and the forecast period (2020-24), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair are, in most countries, well under way. Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America, and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe, and Asia and Australasia, but ahead of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
EU countries and Nordics score particularly well in our rankings
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of countries in western Europe in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tensions notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Business environment in eastern Europe has improved since 1990s
T he investment climate of central and eastern Europe has improved consid-erably in recent years. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even there. Factors such as a low-cost, but well-qualified, labour force, proximity to developed markets, and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region over the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges, including high levels of emigration, a declining workforce and a high social security burden. Meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. Throughout the region, the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable. In Russia, the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the Russian government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. However, low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to seek to open up and diversify their economies.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to serve out its second five-year term, which expires in 2024. Its re-election in May 2019 will underpin political stability. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration in 2020-24.
Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24, albeit punctuated by trade tensions. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Relations with Pakistan will also be fractious, owing to continuing border tensions. Low-level military clashes between the two countries remain likely in 2020-24.
The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slew of fiscal measures announced by the government, most notably a corporate tax cut that will crimp revenue collection. During the forecast period the fiscal deficit will remain wide overall, as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to leave its policy interest rates unchanged in 2020 before embarking on a tightening cycle from 2021.
Real GDP growth will slump to 4.9% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.3% in 2020/21-2024/25.
We expect consumer price inflation to exceed the mid-point of the central bank's 2-6% target range in 2020-24. The key driver will be a sustained recovery in domestic demand. Our forecasts assume normal monsoons.
The rupee is forecast to stabilise against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs70.3:US$1 in 2020. The currency will weaken against the US dollar in 2021-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2022-24: The government makes some further efforts to ease the process of borrowing overseas for companies and to reduce capital-account restrictions. However, full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes
2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing
2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market
2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure
2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

a Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or in purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure continuity in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the recent election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have increased in recent years. There is a heightened possibility of communal violence in the light of the Supreme Court's decision in mid-November to allot a disputed piece of land in Ayodhya, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, for construction of a Hindu temple. However, the state government (which controls the local police) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, in order to avoid public criticism and international scrutiny.
The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) pose risks to political stability. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, instances of unrest have been reported. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move will also increase the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
State assembly elections held in October resulted in a BJP-led government in Haryana, but a hung assembly in Maharashtra. Uddhav Thackeray, president of the Shiv Sena, was eventually sworn in as the new chief minister of Maharashtra in November, depriving the BJP representative of seats in the upper house of parliament. However, the state government led by Mr Thackeray is likely to be an unstable one. The coalition comprises the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress; all three are traditional rivals. Assembly elections commenced in Jharkhand at end-November. We expect the ruling BJP to secure another term in office there.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they are significantly short of a majority. Given the BJP's strong performance in the general and state elections, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are expected to achieve a majority in the Rajya Sabha by mid-2021. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the revocation was announced, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties between the two countries. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence. To this effect, India has boosted security co-operation with the US in recent years, and this will continue during our forecast period.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March). We believe that this sum will help to address balance-sheet problems. It will improve liquidity in the banking sector but given weak business sentiment, this initiative is unlikely to boost lending in the months ahead.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Once the NDA has control of the Rajya Sabha, from mid-2021, the legislative process will be eased. However, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September in response to weak GDP data for April-June. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotive, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies the option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2% including various surcharges), from 30% previously. This was backdated to the start of fiscal year 2019/20, in order to spur private-sector activity.
Fiscal stimulus measures and the revenue foregone owing to the corporate tax cut will leave a large hole in government finances. We expect the fiscal deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP in 2019/20. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3.1% of GDP by 2022/23. Thereafter, spending pressures will increase in the run-up to the parliamentary election in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit in 2023/24. Our forecast assumes no more tax cuts in 2020-2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will, nevertheless, continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government. It will seek to increase the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will remain significant, averaging the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP a year in 2020/21-2024/25.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits in some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. In October the RBI sanctioned a 25-basis-point reduction in the repurchase (repo) rate to 5.15%, a nine-year low. Consequently, the reverse repo rate was reduced to 4.9%. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will hold rates in 2020. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
The Indian economy grew at the slowest rate in more than six years in the quarter ending September 2019. Real GDP growth slowed to 4.6% year on year in April-June, compared with a rate of 5% in the previous quarter. Weak consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. The data have reinforced our view that the process of economic recovery will be protracted. Nevertheless, a series of stimulus measures enacted by the government, coupled with a low-interest-rate environment, are likely to spur demand and investment from the second half of 2019/20. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 4.9% in 2019/20.
We now believe that the scope for further tax and interest-rate cuts is limited over the forecast period. As a consequence we have revised down our forecasts and expect real GDP to grow by an annual average of 6.3% in 2020/21-2024/25, compared with 6.5% previously. A recovery in global growth in 2021 will support exports, but an anticipated acceleration in investment growth will suck in more imports of goods and services, which will exert a drag on the headline GDP figure. Growth is expected to moderate to an average of 6.3% in 2024/25 as tighter monetary conditions dampen investment growth and temper consumption. India will, nevertheless, remain among the fastest-growing major economies during the forecast period.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in the sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Lower crude oil prices will have a dampening effect on prices in 2020, but this will be more than offset by the lagged effect of currency depreciation in 2019 and the lingering adverse effects of an extended monsoon. Consumer price inflation is forecast to accelerate in 2020, to an average of 4.2%, from an estimated 3.4% in 2019. In 2021 sharp increases in food and global oil prices will lift consumer price inflation to 4.4% on average. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon in that year.
The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in late 2021 will offset the inflationary impact of continued strengthening in oil prices in 2022, keeping consumer price growth steady at 4.4%. As oil prices stabilise in 2023-24 and the RBI accords a higher priority to containing inflationary pressures, consumer price growth is expected to ease to an average of 4.3%.
Low global prices for oil and industrial raw materials will keep producer price inflation muted at 1.8% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.5% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
We expect the rupee to end 2019 at a weaker rate of Rs71.8:US$1, compared with Rs69.8:US$1 at end-2018. The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive monetary loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status, have weighed on the exchange rate. Weakness in the economy will exert depreciatory pressure on the currency in 2020. Nevertheless, the rupee will stabilise at an average of Rs70.3:US$1 as a further drop in global oil prices leads to a narrowing in the current-account deficit as a proportion of GDP. This stabilisation will be supported by an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) against the backdrop of an anticipated economic slowdown in the US. In the near term, the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will remain vulnerable to temporary spikes in the level of political risk in India.
In 2021-23 the rupee will return to a gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. We expect the rupee to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external payment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
Stronger investment from 2020 and higher oil prices from 2021 will swell the import bill, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.8% of GDP annually in 2020-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$47bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to higher taxes imposed on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. The most important of the US sanctions is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September it also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. [...]we expect waivers that allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela not to be renewed in July 2020, given the imminence of the US election. At present, we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. [...]the country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities. [...]the latest sanctions from the US Treasury department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit previously expected the socioeconomic crisis and collapse in oil revenue since early 2019 to trigger regime change. However, in recent months, risks to this assumption have risen and our baseline forecast now assumes that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. On this basis, we expect an ongoing deterioration of the economy, continued outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions, and their impact on oil production, the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through strict control of the security forces.
The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime will continue to be challenged economically and politically. In July 2020 we expect the US government to not renew waivers on Chevron and other US oil companies; this will destabilise crude production, at least in the short term. Moreover, given that it will lose control over the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
The government has recently allowed the official exchange rate to float, which has alleviated pressures on its foreign-exchange reserves. Furthermore, de facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding, which aids price stability and thus the availability of some basic goods. These measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.

Venezuela is in 78th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, up from 80th in the 2015-19 historical period. As the economic crisis begins to bottom out in 2020, some improvements are expected, but reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Limited rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain subdued, while red tape and ad hoc interventionism will continue.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit very slowly.
Taxes
2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but declining risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures.
Financing
2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns around economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but continued risk of water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election of Hugo Chávez in 1998, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018, as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit had long maintained that Venezuela's economic crisis would be a trigger for regime change. However, the risks to this assumption were always high and had grown in recent months. We have therefore changed our baseline forecasts to assume that the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) will retain power, despite severe economic and international pressure. Mr Maduro has remained in office amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The imposition of US sanctions has taken a dramatic economic toll, in particular by causing a collapse in oil production. However, a shift towards Asian markets has provided some stability to oil production in recent months, as has support from Russia and Cuba to circumvent US sanctions. In addition, the regime continues to benefit from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities. These sources of US dollars have prevented sanctions from fatally wounding the regime's patronage system. It is this patronage, along with strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces, and purges within its ranks, which has allowed the regime successfully to manage internal dissent.
Internal and external efforts to oust Mr Maduro are fading. The opposition, led by the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum it held in early 2019 after abortive dialogue efforts and, in particular, after the failed uprising in April. International pressure has plateaued as the administration of the US president, Donald Trump, shifts its attention to the November 2020 US presidential election; meanwhile, the Lima Group and the Organisation of American States (OAS) seem to have exhausted most of their diplomatic ammunition. Large-scale emigration has also benefited Mr Maduro. The exodus has eased pressure on it, while increasing inflows of workers' remittances, which provide the regime with hard currency. Furthermore, the population has grown protest-weary and there has, in relative terms, been some stabilisation of the economy; de facto dollarisation has brought about an improvement in price stability and thus increased the availability of some basic goods.
Although it is no longer our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is still a very high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as very low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are set to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup.
The risks of such a political transition will be particularly high in 2020. We expect the Trump administration to refuse to grant an additional waiver to Chevron, and other US oil services firms, in July. This will again destabilise oil production in the short term and test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. But perhaps most important is the fact that the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly-the only remaining legitimate body-in January 2021, assuming that the regime engineers rigged elections in late 2020. Without such power, the possibility of a transition towards an opposition-led or mixed administration would plummet. Mr Guaidó and the opposition will therefore be under pressure to try to force regime change before then; the prospect of the PSUV clinging to power on a permanent basis could prove a trigger for a renewed popular uprising. In such an environment, and if sanctions bite further, pragmatists within government and the military could turn on Mr Maduro, paving the way for some sort of political transition. The country's crumbling infrastructure could also act as a trigger for transition. A particularly dry summer (January-April) could exacerbate what is already likely to be a difficult season in 2020, leading to severe electricity and water shortages, with the prospect of protests against the regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
On the assumption that the Maduro regime clings to power, legislative elections will take place in December 2020. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and so the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority, and would attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. However, efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The most important of the US sanctions is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September it also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. Moreover, we expect waivers that allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela not to be renewed in July 2020, given the imminence of the US election. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA, the state oil company. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seemingly with little success in terms of finance for investment. That said, Russia is believed to be helping PDVSA to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). However, Russia's interest in Venezuela is mainly geopolitical, not economic. If a transition from the Maduro regime came about, we believe that Russia (and China) would be willing to work with its successor in order to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
Given our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence of attempts to tighten monetary policy in recent months, in order to rein in hyperinflation and abandon foreign-exchange controls (official exchange rates are in line with the black market). De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit this year to remain well into double digits as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, growing remittance inflows and chronically weaker domestic demand will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. The public debt/GDP ratio will remain very high in the coming years; however, the sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. At present, we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. Moreover, the country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October and was not paid. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. That said, the US considers Citgo and its Caribbean facilities to be under Mr Guaidó's purview. As a result, the latest sanctions from the US Treasury department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. We expect the Trump administration to keep these measures in place during 2020. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (until now legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary steadying effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed some stabilisation of the bolívar during 2019. Nevertheless, the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the rate of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline of 20.5% in 2020. This will be driven by weaker private demand, owing to falling real incomes and continued migration, and-most importantly-a further contraction in oil output. In 2021-24 we forecast that economic growth will contract at an annual average rate of 4.6%, a more moderate rate of decline than in previous years, assuming a stabilisation of oil output. Private consumption will continue to contract in 2020 as unemployment, violence and falling incomes continue to force mass migration, further weakening domestic demand.
We believe that the Trump administration will bar Chevron and other US oil companies from operating in Venezuela, probably in July 2020. We expect this action to curb oil production at the Petropiar joint venture (between Chevron and PDVSA) in the Orinoco Belt. The impact on oil production will be limited in the short term; after the ban, PDVSA would either take full control of the venture or assume joint control with Russian oil company Rosneft. Even so, we expect oil output to slip to just 600,000 barrels/day in 2020. Under PDVSA control, crude production will fail to reach previous figures. In the medium term, we expect oil output to continue to fall-albeit more gradually-owing to serious operational problems, such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or in finding qualified staff.
Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24, on the back of moderately higher global oil prices and as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. In addition, import compression will continue, which means that net exports will partly offset chronically weak internal demand.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which are based on an assumption that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of this improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant divergence between these and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit will see inflation come down from the hyperinflationary rates of recent years. Nevertheless, it will remain very high for as long as the Maduro regime stays in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, as well as the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls in mid-2019. Although this is a positive move, access to US dollars via formal means is limited as significant barriers remain in place that in practice restrict access to dollars. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On November 29th the official exchange rate was BsS38,930:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS41,594:US$1. The premium, although sizeable, was still small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) has hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn this year).
We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, averaging 3.6% of GDP in 2020-24. The trade surplus will recover gradually, as international oil prices increase moderately and as the country steps up exports to Asian markets. This will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve root-and-branch reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufactured goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Even though a multiple-exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016), but import restrictions will be widened, especially on food.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2020-24) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to restrict imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some reduction in the central bank's policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
In 2020 export earnings will fall as global oil prices decline, but imports will also fall. Imports and exports will both rise in 2021-24, and a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2020-24), as do its global and regional rankings, as the administration struggles with the reform process.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector remains characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2022-24: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress is slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: In 2020 the government aims to squeeze revenue from oil companies to address fiscal imbalances. New royalty rates in the offshore subsector harm direct investment inflows from foreign oil majors.
2022-24: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy firms are in any case hesitant to increase their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Import bans are widened dramatically, but capital controls prove unnecessary, barring another oil price crash.
2022-24: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2020-21: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased in 2020 from 5% to 7.2% to fund a higher minimum wage, introduced in 2019.
2022-24: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2020-21: Domestic interest rates are high, but fall as restrictions are loosened on local participation in some parts of the money market. The government seeks soft multilateral loans wherever possible, but also depends on Eurobonds.
2022-24: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2020-21: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2022-24: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing and higher public-sector wages. Although growth in private-sector investment is likely, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2022-24: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2022-24: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won the February 2019 presidential election and will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to restore stability across Nigeria, but managing the country's myriad security threats will prove an insuperable challenge, mainly because the military and police are overstretched and will be unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will in effect be triaged, with resources being deployed to whichever is seen as most pressing at any given time.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), is an urgent issue. As the area is a stronghold of the ruling party, the president will be keen to reassert control. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the region will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign will divert security forces away from pockets of instability elsewhere.
One other hotspot is the agricultural Middle Belt, where farmers and nomads are in conflict over land and water resources. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious.
Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be deployed to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but will not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of reduced food supplies and higher prices.
Another localised conflict with wide-ranging consequences will be militant activity in the oil-producing south, where insurgents are demanding more hydrocarbons revenue to be retained locally for development. Weak governance in the region has, as a by-product, encouraged oil theft and sabotage of pipelines and other facilities. Millions of barrels of oil are lost annually (22m in the first half of 2019). Reforming how federal revenue is allocated is a massive, politically loaded task that continually divides parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit's assumption is that attacks on oil infrastructure by aggrieved militants and saboteurs will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
In a more general sense, the military and the police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping across the country. Widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
The next national elections are in 2023. Custom dictates that the presidential candidates of both main parties will be from the south, which is a stronghold for the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP)-allowing them to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the last presidential vote in 2019. Moreover, Nigeria's economic outlook up to the next elections does not point towards a material decrease in widespread poverty. Frustration with declining living standards and high levels of crime and instability will be directed at the governing All Progressives Congress, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Trade relations with South Africa have boomed recently but diplomatic ties have deteriorated over xenophobic attacks against Nigerians living in South Africa (and, in response, against South African businesses in Nigeria). The South African authorities have long struggled to curb xenophobic violence and serious bouts do occasionally occur-although the issue is emotive, it is unlikely to undermine high-level ties.
As regards investment, India is the largest market for Nigerian oil and will become a bigger source of foreign finance. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.
Exasperation over smuggling-which policymakers view as undermining a protectionist agenda-has led to all of Nigeria's land borders being closed for goods traffic. The measure will prove temporary, as social unrest would be a risk if consumer prices were to rise for any sustained period. However, the move underlines erratic commitment to regional trade, particularly when it threatens local agriculture or manufacturing competitiveness. Meaningful participation in an Africa-wide free trade agreement that the government acceded to in 2019 is therefore unlikely.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
An advisory council has been set up by the president to assist on economic reform, but the direction of economic policy under Mr Buhari will remain interventionist. Courting technocratic advisors is a common tradition among Nigerian leaders, but in reality liberal policy intentions flounder if they stand to upset the delicate status quo: market distortions in Nigeria have reached proportions whereby undoing them would necessitate a major correction-something that Mr Buhari is likely to balk at.
Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be completed. Electricity tariffs have barely changed since 2015, meaning that the adjustment needed to allow distributors to turn a profit would be enormous-and a recipe for high inflation and a severe political backlash. Likewise, an overvalued official rate for Nigeria's currency, the naira, is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies (over 90% of petrol is imported), and Mr Buhari will not willingly reverse pump-price caps and risk popular outrage (attempts to hike petrol prices in the past have led to disruptive protests).
Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of multiple exchange rates carries an ever-present risk of capital controls being imposed and will be off-putting to those acquiring illiquid assets in Nigeria; foreign direct investment inflows are expected to be equivalent to less than 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period. Adding to these concerns, to defend foreign reserves and the official rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will probably widen restrictions on foreign exchange access for imported goods (currently 44 items are barred) in 2020 as the average price of oil falls.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned companies such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. Generally, the preference of the Buhari administration will be to sanitise loss-making state companies rather than relinquish control over them. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint ventures that it has with international oil companies, but uncertainty about fiscal terms and a difficult operating environment mean that investor interest will fall short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off key public assets cheaply.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits in 2020-24. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes and a planned increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 5% now to 7.5% in 2020. (We assume that this will go ahead, despite some parliamentary resistance and with numerous exemptions for consumer goods, as it underpins the whole budget.) Revenue increases in 2020 will be held back by low oil prices, however, and the fact that the new VAT rate is still among the world's lowest. Tax avoidance is widespread, and instability impedes collection in many parts of the country.
Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and overambitious oil production targets mean that budgeted revenue targets will not be reached. For example, in 2020 the government expects output of 2.2m barrels/day-a level that has not been seen since the oil price slump and is unobtainable, given underinvestment and probable OPEC production quotas. Federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.8% of GDP in 2020-24.
With revenue being so low, fiscal spending power will be highly limited, and budget flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, therefore, revenue-under pressure combined with considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Following which, there will be another decline in expenditure in 2024.
In all, we expect an average budget deficit of 2% of GDP a year in 2020-24, with the highest shortfall (2.2% of GDP) in the election year of 2023. These will be financed externally and by soft loans wherever possible, but the bulk of finance will come from commercial debt and local borrowing.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against an abnormally low revenue base. Debt service can take up to half of federal revenue, which is alarming even by heavily-indebted emerging-market standards. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The CBN is inclined towards boosting the supply side of the economy, but inflation is well above the targeted upper limit of 9% and monetary loosening in 2020 could lead to capital outflows and put downward pressure on the naira at a time of low oil prices. Overall, we do not expect interest rates to move until 2021, when inflation will enter a sustained downward trend, giving the CBN a chance to act on a growth-first impulse. We also expect that oil prices will rise in 2021-23, driving higher foreign-exchange inflows and lessening the need to support the naira through portfolio inflows.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
Economic growth will remain weak but will pick up as the forecast period progresses. In 2020 the economy will grow by just 2%, unchanged from 2019, held back by power shortages, insecurity, elevated inflation and tight credit conditions. With high debt-servicing costs leaving no room for fiscal activism, monetary policy is the main lever that can drive a recovery. In 2021, as external conditions strengthen with faster global growth and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken to 2.9%. Growth will average 3.2% in 2021-24, a level that is well below potential.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agricultural growth will be lacklustre. Although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms; hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels seen prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery that is due to come on stream by late 2021 will boost downstream oil activity and wider economic growth in 2022-24. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of electricity shortages, although looser credit conditions will stimulate growth as the forecast period progresses. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth, but it will nonetheless be held back by the impact of protectionism on trade (which accounts for over 15% of GDP).
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
After averaging an estimated 11.4% in 2019, inflation will stay high in 2020, at 11.3%, well above the CBN's target ceiling of 9%. Widening foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of manufactures and food at a time of inadequate local supply will be the main cause. A probable hike in VAT from 5% to 7.5% will also contribute, but the inflationary impact will be muted by exemptions across multiple consumer-goods categories. With base effects from this fading, and with oil prices rising (reducing the need for further import restrictions as a means of defending the naira), core inflation will gradually ease over the remainder of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it, to an average of 8.3% in 2024. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-will prevent a faster slide.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2020-24, with an official rate for government business and a more market-determined rate for investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors or firms (including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate) deemed important for economic or political reasons.
The central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, has proven willing to adopt unconventional measures to keep the naira stable, which he argues is essential to avoid an inflationary spike and capital flight. As oil prices decline in 2020, foreign-exchange restrictions will be widened to curb what has been a surge in import demand. However, there will not be a need for capital controls (which were introduced temporarily in 2016), as we expect a current-account surplus to persevere, and easier global monetary conditions in 2020 will support the naira through portfolio inflows. Higher global crude prices thereafter will continue to support the official rate.
Currency stability means steady real appreciation of the naira against the currencies of Nigeria's trading partners as inflation remains high relative to those countries. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue in order to regain international competitiveness for the non-oil sector. However, the CBN's industrial strategy (the central bank has long had similarities with a development agency) is focused on supplying the domestic market, and such an eventuality is not forecast. We forecast that the naira will weaken to an average of N313.7:US$1 in 2024, from an estimated average of N306.6:US$1 in 2019.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. It also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
Export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. In 2020 falling oil prices will offset rising production and cause earnings to decline. In 2021-23 higher global prices and output gains (with a new mega-refinery due to come on stream in 2021, which we expect to be export-oriented) will lead to a return to strong export growth, which will slow in 2024 as oil prices retreat again.
The government promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural products). After a sharp rise in purchases across various import categories in 2019, widening import restrictions will cause the import bill to drop back in 2020. Lower oil-and so petrol-prices that will also have a dampening effect year (refinery capacity is low, and Nigeria imports much of its petrol). As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise, imports will grow again.
Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, although they will dip in 2020 as growth falters in the US, which is home to a large Nigerian diaspora. Overall, the current-account surplus will widen from an estimated 0.4% of GDP in 2019 to 1.9% of GDP in 2024 as imports fall in 2020 and exports-of both crude oil and refined products-rise.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to serve out its second five-year term, which expires in 2024. Its re-election in May 2019 will underpin political stability. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration in 2020-24.
Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24, albeit punctuated by trade tensions. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Relations with Pakistan will also be tense, owing to continuing border tensions. Low-level military clashes between the two countries remain likely in 2020-24.
The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slew of fiscal measures announced by the government, most notably a corporate tax cut that will crimp revenue collection. During the forecast period the fiscal deficit will remain wide overall, as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments.
Real GDP growth will slump to 4.9% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.5% in 2020/21-2024/25.
We expect consumer prices to increase by an annual average of 4.3% in 2020-24. Lower global crude oil prices will help to contain inflationary pressures in 2020, allowing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to maintain an accommodative stance. The RBI will take a more hawkish stance from 2021 as stronger domestic demand adds to price pressures.
Owing to an expected widening of the interest-rate differential with the US, the rupee is expected to appreciate slightly in 2020. The currency will weaken against the US dollar in 2021-24, averaging Rs72.2:US$1 in those years, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2022-24: The government makes some further efforts to ease the process of borrowing overseas for companies and to reduce capital-account restrictions. However, full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes
2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing
2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market
2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure
2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

a Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or in purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure continuity in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the recent election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have increased in recent years, and there is a heightened possibility of communal violence in light of the Supreme Court's decision in mid-November to allot a disputed piece of land in Ayodhya, located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, for construction of a Hindu temple. However, the state government (which controls the local police) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, in order to avoid public criticism and international scrutiny.
The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) pose risks to political stability. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, instances of unrest have been reported. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move will also increase the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
State assembly elections held on October 21st resulted in a BJP-led government in Haryana but a hung assembly in Maharashtra. President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra on November 11th, as a pre-poll alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena splintered and lawmakers struggled to form a government. Nevertheless, we expect the political logjam to clear by the end of the year and the Shiv Sena to form a coalition government in the state. Assembly elections are expected to take place in November in Jharkhand, where we expect the ruling BJP to secure another term in office.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they are significantly short of a majority. Given the BJP's strong performance in the general and state elections, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are expected to achieve a majority in the Rajya Sabha by mid-2021. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the revocation was announced, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties between the two countries. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the governments will ensure that these do not escalate into full conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence. To this effect, India has boosted security co-operation with the US in recent years, and this will continue during our forecast period.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March). We believe that this sum, if delivered in full, would be sufficient to substantially address balance-sheet problems, but implementation may be a challenge.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as an overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Once the NDA controls the Rajya Sabha, from 2021, the legislative process will be eased. However, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September following the release of GDP data for April-June, which showed the economy expanding by 5%, representing the slowest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2013. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotive, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies the option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2% including various surcharges), from 30% previously. This was backdated to the start of fiscal year 2019/20, in order to spur private-sector activity.
Fiscal stimulus measures and the revenue foregone owing to the corporate tax cut will leave a large hole in government finances. We expect the fiscal deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP in 2019/20. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3.2% of GDP by 2022/23. Thereafter, spending pressures will increase in the run-up to the parliamentary election in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit in 2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government. It will seek to increase the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will remain significant, averaging the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP a year in 2020/21-2024/25.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits in some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. In October the RBI sanctioned a 25-basis-point reduction in the repurchase (repo) rate to 5.15%, a nine-year low. Consequently, the reverse repo rate was reduced to 4.9%. We expect the central bank to cut rates one more time in 2019, at its next monetary policy meeting in December, to provide a further lift to economic growth. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will hold rates in 2020. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
The Indian economy grew at the slowest rate in more than six years in the quarter ending June 2019. Real GDP growth slowed to 5% year on year in April-June, compared with a rate of 5.8% in the previous quarter. Depressed consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. Recent high-frequency data indicate that economic activity failed to regain momentum in the quarter ending September and remained weak into October. We now therefore expect the process of economic recovery to be more protracted than before. Nevertheless, a series of stimulus measures enacted by the government, coupled with a low-interest-rate environ-ment, are likely to spur demand and investment from the second half of 2019/20. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 4.9% in 2019/20.
Real GDP growth is expected to recover to an average of 6.5% in 2020/21-2022/23 as domestic demand strengthens. A recovery in global growth in 2021 will also stimulate exports; however, higher domestic investment will suck in imports. Growth is expected to moderate to an average of 6.4% in 2023/24-2024/25 as tighter mone-tary conditions dampen investment growth and temper consumption. India will, nevertheless, remain among the fastest-growing major economies during the forecast period.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in the sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Lower crude oil prices will have a dampening effect on prices in 2020, but this will be more than offset by a modest pick-up in domestic demand growth, the lagged effect of interest-rate cuts and currency depreciation in 2019. Consumer price inflation is forecast to accelerate in 2020, to an average of 4.2%, from an estimated 3.4% in 2019. In 2021 sharp increases in food and global oil prices will lift consumer price inflation to 4.4% on average. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability.
The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in late 2021 will offset the inflationary impact of continued strengthening in oil prices in 2022, keeping consumer price growth steady at 4.4%. As oil prices stabilise in 2023-24 and the RBI accords a higher priority to containing inflationary pressures, consumer price growth is expected to ease to an average of 4.2%. Low global prices for oil and industrial raw materials will keep producer price inflation muted at 1.8% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.4% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
We expect the rupee to end 2019 at a weaker rate of Rs71.9:US$1, compared with Rs69.8:US$1 at end-2018. The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive monetary loosening stance in 2019, coupled with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status, have weighed on the exchange rate. Weakness in the economy will exert depreciatory pressure on the currency in 2020. Nevertheless, the rupee will appreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, owing to a shrinking current-account deficit caused by lower oil prices. This appreciation will be supported by an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) against the backdrop of an anticipated economic slowdown in the US. We expect the rupee to appreciate from an estimated average of Rs70.5:US$1 in 2019 to Rs70:US$1 in 2020. In the near term, the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will remain vulnerable to temporary spikes in the level of political risk in India.
In 2021-23 the rupee will return to a gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. We expect the rupee to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external payment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
Stronger investment from 2020 and higher oil prices from 2021 will swell the import bill, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP annually in 2020-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$47.5bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to higher taxes imposed on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expected Venezuela's socioeconomic crisis and the collapse in oil revenue since early 2019 to trigger regime change. However, in recent months risks to this assumption have risen and our baseline forecast is now that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. On this assumption, we expect an ongoing deterioration of the economy, continued outward migration and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions, and their impact on oil production, the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty to the regime and also through strict control of the security forces.
The scale of the current socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime will continue to be challenged economically and politically. In July 2020 we expect the US government to not renew waivers on Chevron and other US oil companies; this will destabilise crude production, at least in the short term. Moreover, given that it will lose control over the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
The government has recently allowed the official exchange rate to float, which has alleviated pressures on its foreign-exchange reserves. Furthermore, de facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding, which is aiding price stability and thus the availability of some basic goods. These measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.

Venezuela is in 78th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, up from 80th in the 2015-19 historical period. As the economic crisis begins to bottom out in 2020, some improvements are expected, but reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Rollback begins of interventionist measures, such as price controls; concerns over political instability slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the removal of the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Regulation by a new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt to attract investment.
2022-24: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit very slowly.
Taxes
2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but declining risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures.
Financing
2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns around economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but continued risk of water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election of Hugo Chávez in 1998, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit had long maintained that Venezuela's economic crisis would be a trigger for regime change in Venezuela. However, the risks to this assumption were always high and had grown in recent months. We have now changed our baseline forecasts to assume that the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) will retain power, despite severe economic and international pressure. Mr Maduro has clung to office amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The imposition of US sanctions has taken a dramatic economic toll, in particular by causing a collapse in oil production. However, a shift towards Asian markets, and support from Russia and Cuba to get round US sanctions, have lent some stability to oil production in recent months. In addition, the regime continues to benefit from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities. These sources of US dollars have meant that sanctions have not fatally wounded the regime's patronage system. It is this patronage, along with strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces, and purges within its ranks, that has allowed the regime successfully to manage internal dissent.
Internal and external efforts to oust Mr Maduro are fading. The opposition, led by the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum it held in early 2019 after abortive dialogue efforts and, in particular, after the failed uprising in April. International pressure has plateaued as the US administration of Donald Trump shifts its attention to the November 2020 US presidential election, and the Lima Group and the Organisation of American States (OAS) seem to have exhausted most of their diplomatic ammunition. Large-scale emigration has also benefited Mr Maduro. The exodus has eased pressure on the regime, while increasing inflows of workers' remittances, which provide the regime with hard currency. On top of all this, the population is protest-weary and there has, in relative terms, been some stabilisation of the economy, with de facto dollarisation bringing an improvement in price stability and thus in the availability of some basic goods.
Although it is no longer our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is still a very high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as very low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are set to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup.
The risks of such a political transition will be particularly high in 2020. We expect the Trump administration to refuse to grant an additional waiver to Chevron, and other US oil services firms, in July. This will again destabilise oil production in the short term and test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. But perhaps most important is the fact that the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly, the only remaining legitimate body, in January 2021, assuming that the regime engineers rigged elections in late 2020. Without such power, the possibility of a transition towards an opposition-led or mixed administration would plummet. Mr Guaidó and the opposition will therefore be under pressure to try to force regime change before then; the prospect of the PSUV clinging to power on a permanent basis could prove a trigger for a renewed popular uprising. In such an environment, and if sanctions bite further, pragmatists within government and the military could turn on Mr Maduro, paving the way for some sort of political transition. The country's crumbling infrastructure could also act as a trigger for transition. A particularly dry summer (January-April) could exacerbate what is already likely to be a difficult season in 2020, which will in all likelihood lead to severe electricity and water shortages, with the prospect of protests against the regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
On the assumption that the Maduro regime clings on to power, legislative elections will take place in December 2020. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and so the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim transitional government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority, and would attempt to hold elections within 12 months of its formation, although this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. However, efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The most important of the US sanctions is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad that will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September it also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. Moreover, we expect waivers that allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela not to be renewed in July 2020, given the imminence of the 2020 US election. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA, the state oil company. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seemingly with little success in terms of finance for investment. That said, Russia is believed to be helping the state oil company, PDVSA, to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). However, Russia's interest in Venezuela is mainly geopolitical, not economic. If a transition from the Maduro regime came about, we believe that Russia (and China) would be willing to work with its successor in order to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
Given our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy in order to rein in hyperinflation and to abandon foreign-exchange controls (official exchange rates are in line with the black market). De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, the Maduro regime now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit this year to remain well into double digits as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, growing remittance inflows and chronically weaker domestic demand will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. The public debt/GDP ratio will remain very high during the coming years; however, the sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. At present, we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. Moreover, the country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo-PDVSA's US subsidiary-as collateral, fell due at end-October and was not paid. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. That said, the US considers Citgo and its Caribbean facilities to be under Mr Guaidó's purview. As a result, the latest sanctions from the US Treasury Department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. We expect the Trump administration to keep these measures in place during 2020. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (until now legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary steadying effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed some stabilisation of the bolívar during 2019. Nevertheless, the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the rate of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 66% since 2013), we expect a further decline of 20.5% in 2020. This will be driven by weaker private demand, owing to falling real incomes and continued migration, and-most importantly-a further contraction in oil output. In 2021-24 we forecast that economic growth will contract at an annual average rate of 4.6%, a more moderate rate of decline than in previous years, assuming a stabilisation of oil output. Private consumption will continue to contract in 2020 as unemployment, violence and falling incomes continue to force mass migration, further weakening domestic demand.
We believe that the Trump administration will bar Chevron and other US oil companies from operating in Venezuela, probably in July 2020. We expect this action to curb oil production at the Petropiar joint venture (between Chevron and PDVSA) in the Orinoco Belt. The impact on oil production will be limited in the short term; after the ban, PDVSA would either take full control of the venture or assume joint control with Russian oil company Rosneft. Even so, we expect oil output to slip to just 600,000 barrels/day in 2020. Under PDVSA control, crude production will fail to reach previous figures. In the medium term, we expect oil output to continue to fall-albeit more gradually-owing to serious operational problems, such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or in finding qualified staff.
Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24 on the basis of moderately higher global oil prices and as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. In addition, import compression will continue, and this means that net exports will partly offset chronically weak internal demand.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which are based on an assumption that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium term baseline; the degree of this improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant divergence between these and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit will see inflation come down from the hyperinflationary rates of recent years. Nevertheless, it will remain very high for as long as the Maduro regime stays in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, as well as the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related events are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls in mid-2019. Although this is a positive move, access to US dollars via formal means is limited as significant barriers remain in place that in practice restrict access to dollars. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On November 12th the official exchange rate was BsS27,930:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of almost BsS31,865:US$1. The premium, although sizeable, was still small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) has hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn this year).
We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, averaging 3.6% of GDP in 2020-24. The trade surplus will recover gradually as international oil prices increase moderately and as the country steps up exports to Asian markets. This will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari's second presidential term will not involve root-and-branch reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment. Policy will, in the main, be interventionist and stifle private enterprise.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manu-factured goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Although a multiple-exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as tempor-arily imposed in 2016), but import restrictions will be widened, especially on food.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2020-24) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to restrict imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some reduction in the central bank's policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
In 2020 export earnings will fall as global oil prices decline, but imports will also fall. Imports and exports will both rise in 2021-24, and a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2020-24), as do its global and regional rankings, as the administration will struggle with the reform process.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector remains characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2022-24: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress is slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals meets serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in parliament to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2022-24: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy firms are in any case hesitant to increase their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Import bans are widened dramatically, but capital controls prove unnecessary, barring another oil price crash.
2022-24: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2020-21: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased in 2020 from 5% to 7.5% to fund a higher minimum wage, introduced in 2019.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2020-21: Domestic interest rates are high and borrowing by government crowds out the private sector. The government looks increasingly to international capital markets and wherever possible soft multilateral loans for deficit-financing.
2022-24: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2020-21: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2022-24: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing and higher public-sector wages. Although growth in private-sector investment is likely, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2022-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2022-24: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won the February 2019 presidential election and will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to restore stability across Nigeria, but managing the country's myriad security threats will prove an insuperable challenge, mainly because the military and police are overstretched and will be unable to tackle simul-taneous security crises. Emergencies will in effect be triaged, with resources being deployed to whichever is seen as most pressing at any given time.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), is an urgent issue. As the area is a stronghold of the ruling party, the president will be keen to reassert control. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the region will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign will divert security forces away from pockets of instability elsewhere.
One other hotspot is the agricultural Middle Belt, where farmers and nomads are in conflict over land and water resources. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious.
Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be deployed to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but will not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of reduced food supplies and higher prices.
Another localised conflict with wide-ranging consequences will be militant activity in the oil-producing south, where insurgents are demanding more hydrocarbons revenue to be retained locally for development. Weak governance in the region has, as a by-product, encouraged oil theft and sabotage of pipelines and other facilities. Millions of barrels of oil are lost annually (22m in the first half of 2019). Reforming how federal revenue is allocated is a massive, politically loaded task that continually divides parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit's assumption is that attacks on oil infrastructure by aggrieved militants and saboteurs will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
In a more general sense, the military and the police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping across the country. Widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
The next national elections are in 2023. Custom dictates that the presidential candidates of both main parties will be from the south, which is a stronghold for the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP)-allowing them to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the last presidential vote in 2019. Moreover, Nigeria's economic outlook up to the next elections does not point towards a material decrease in widespread poverty. Frustration with declining living standards and high levels of crime and instability will be directed at the governing All Progressives Congress, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Trade relations with South Africa have boomed recently but diplomatic ties have deteriorated over xenophobic attacks against Nigerians living in South Africa (and, in response, against South African businesses in Nigeria). The South African authorities have long struggled to curb xenophobic violence and serious bouts do occasionally occur-although the issue is emotive, it is unlikely to undermine high-level ties.
As regards investment, India is the largest market for Nigerian oil and will become a bigger source of foreign finance. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused.
Exasperation over smuggling-which policymakers view as undermining a protectionist agenda-has led to all of Nigeria's land borders being closed for goods traffic. The measure will prove temporary, as social unrest would be a risk if consumer prices were to rise for any sustained period. However, the move underlines erratic commitment to regional trade, particularly when it threatens local agriculture or manufacturing competitiveness. Meaningful participation in an Africa-wide free trade agreement that the government acceded to in 2019 is therefore unlikely.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
An advisory council has been set up by the president to assist on economic reform, but the direction of economic policy under Mr Buhari will remain interventionist. Courting technocratic advisors is a common tradition among Nigerian leaders, but in reality liberal policy intentions flounder if they stand to upset the delicate status quo: market distortions in Nigeria have reached proportions whereby undoing them would necessitate a major correction-something that Mr Buhari is likely to balk at.
Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be completed. Electricity tariffs have barely changed since 2015, meaning that the adjustment needed to allow distributors to turn a profit would be enormous-and a recipe for high inflation and a severe political backlash. Likewise, an overvalued official rate for Nigeria's currency, the naira, is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies (over 90% of petrol is imported), and Mr Buhari will not willingly reverse pump-price caps and risk popular outrage (attempts to hike petrol prices in the past have led to disruptive protests).
Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of multiple exchange rates carries an ever-present risk of capital controls being imposed and will be off-putting to those acquiring illiquid assets in Nigeria; foreign direct investment inflows are expected to be equivalent to less than 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period. Adding to these concerns, to defend foreign reserves and the official rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will probably widen restrictions on foreign exchange access for imported goods (currently 44 items are barred) in 2020 as the average price of oil falls.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned companies such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. Generally, the preference of the Buhari administration will be to sanitise loss-making state companies rather than relinquish control over them. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint ventures that it has with international oil companies, but uncertainty about fiscal terms and a difficult operating environment mean that investor interest will fall short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off key public assets cheaply.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits in 2020-24. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes and a planned increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 5% now to 7.5% in 2020. (We assume that this will go ahead, despite some parliamentary resistance and with numerous exemptions for consumer goods, as it underpins the whole budget.) Revenue increases in 2020 will be held back by low oil prices, however, and the fact that the new VAT rate is still among the world's lowest. Tax avoidance is widespread, and instability impedes collection in many parts of the country.
Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and overambitious oil production targets mean that budgeted revenue targets will not be reached. For example, in 2020 the government expects output of 2.2m barrels/day-a level that has not been seen since the oil price slump and is unobtainable, given underinvestment and probable OPEC production quotas. Federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.8% of GDP in 2020-24.
With revenue being so low, fiscal spending power will be highly limited, and budget flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, therefore, revenue-under pressure combined with considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Following which, there will be another decline in expenditure in 2024.
In all, we expect an average budget deficit of 2% of GDP a year in 2020-24, with the highest shortfall (2.2% of GDP) in the election year of 2023. These will be financed externally and by soft loans wherever possible, but the bulk of finance will come from commercial debt and local borrowing.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against an abnormally low revenue base. Debt service can take up to half of federal revenue, which is alarming even by heavily-indebted emerging-market standards. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The CBN is inclined towards boosting the supply side of the economy, but inflation is well above the targeted upper limit of 9% and monetary loosening in 2020 could lead to capital outflows and put downward pressure on the naira at a time of low oil prices. Overall, we do not expect interest rates to move until 2021, when inflation will enter a sustained downward trend, giving the CBN a chance to act on a growth-first impulse. We also expect that oil prices will rise in 2021-23, driving higher foreign-exchange inflows and lessening the need to support the naira through portfolio inflows.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
Economic growth will remain weak but will pick up as the forecast period progresses. In 2020 the economy will grow by just 2%, unchanged from 2019, held back by power shortages, insecurity, elevated inflation and tight credit conditions. With high debt-servicing costs leaving no room for fiscal activism, monetary policy is the main lever that can drive a recovery. In 2021, as external conditions strengthen with faster global growth and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken to 2.9%. Growth will average 3.2% in 2021-24, a level that is well below potential.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agricultural growth will be lacklustre. Although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms; hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels seen prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery that is due to come on stream by late 2021 will boost downstream oil activity and wider economic growth in 2022-24. The manu-facturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of electricity shortages, although looser credit conditions will stimulate growth as the forecast period progresses. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth, but it will nonetheless be held back by the impact of protectionism on trade (which accounts for over 15% of GDP).
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
After averaging an estimated 11.4% in 2019, inflation will stay high in 2020, at 11.3%, well above the CBN's target ceiling of 9%. Widening foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of manufactures and food at a time of inadequate local supply will be the main cause. A probable hike in VAT from 5% to 7.5% will also contribute, but the inflationary impact will be muted by exemptions across multiple consumer-goods categories. With base effects from this fading, and with oil prices rising (reducing the need for further import restrictions as a means of defending the naira), core inflation will gradually ease over the remainder of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it, to an average of 8.3% in 2024. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-will prevent a faster slide.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2020-24, with an official rate for government business and a more market-determined rate for investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors or firms (including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate) deemed important for economic or political reasons.
The central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, has proven willing to adopt unconventional measures to keep the naira stable, which he argues is essential to avoid an inflationary spike and capital flight. As oil prices decline in 2020, foreign-exchange restrictions will be widened to curb what has been a surge in import demand. However, there will not be a need for capital controls (which were introduced temporarily in 2016), as we expect a current-account surplus to persevere, and easier global monetary conditions in 2020 will support the naira through portfolio inflows. Higher global crude prices thereafter will continue to support the official rate.
Currency stability means steady real appreciation of the naira against the currencies of Nigeria's trading partners as inflation remains high relative to those countries. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue in order to regain international competitiveness for the non-oil sector. However, the CBN's industrial strategy (the central bank has long had similarities with a development agency) is focused on supplying the domestic market, and such an eventuality is not forecast. We forecast that the naira will weaken to an average of N313.7:US$1 in 2024, from an estimated average of N306.6:US$1 in 2019.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. It also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
Export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. In 2020 falling oil prices will offset rising production and cause earnings to decline. In 2021-23 higher global prices and output gains (with a new mega-refinery due to come on stream in 2021, which we expect to be export-oriented) will lead to a return to strong export growth, which will slow in 2024 as oil prices retreat again.
The government promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural products). After a sharp rise in purchases across various import categories in 2019, widening import restrictions will cause the import bill to drop back in 2020. Lower oil-and so petrol-prices that will also have a dampening effect year (refinery capacity is low, and Nigeria imports much of its petrol). As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise, imports will grow again.
Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remit-tances will remain an important source of hard currency, although they will dip in 2020 as growth falters in the US, which is home to a large Nigerian diaspora. Overall, the current-account surplus will widen from an estimated 0.4% of GDP in 2019 to 1.9% of GDP in 2024 as imports fall in 2020 and exports-of both crude oil and refined products-rise.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to serve out its second five-year term, which expires in 2024. Its re-election in May 2019 will underpin political stability. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration in 2020-24.
Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24, albeit punctuated by trade tensions. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Relations with Pakistan will also be tense, owing to continuing border tensions. Low-level military clashes between the two countries remain likely in 2020-24.
The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slew of fiscal measures announced by the government to support economic growth. During the forecast period the fiscal deficit will remain wide overall, as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments.
Real GDP growth will slump to 5.2% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.6% in 2020/21-2024/25.
We expect consumer prices to increase by an annual average of 4.3% in 2020-24. Lower global crude oil prices will help to contain inflationary pressures in 2020, allowing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to maintain an accommodative stance. The RBI will take a more hawkish stance from 2021 onwards as stronger domestic demand adds to price pressures.
Owing to an expected widening of the interest-rate differential with the US, the rupee is expected to appreciate slightly in 2020. The currency will weaken against the US dollar in 2021-24, averaging Rs71.6:US$1 in those years, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closing of loss-making businesses and their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2022-24: The government makes some efforts to further ease the process of borrowing overseas for companies and to reduce capital-account restrictions. However, full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes
2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing
2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues in public-sector banks persist.
The labour market
2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at the state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure
2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

a Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the sixth-largest in the world in 2017 when measured in nominal US dollars, but the third-largest at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be shallow.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's dominance of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure consistency in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the recent election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Sporadic instances of street violence occurred during the term of the first Modi government, directed particularly towards minority groups. The BJP's right-wing affiliates and sister organisations within the larger Hindu right-wing ecosystem (colloquially known as the Sangh Parivar) used the BJP's political power to pursue their socio-cultural agenda. This includes a goal of recasting India as a Hindu state-a view that puts them at odds with the country's large Muslim minority. Such attacks will persist over the forecast period, but we do not expect them to have a major impact on the business environment.
There is a risk that clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have increased in recent years amid concerns among some Hindu groups about an influx of people from the neighbouring Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh. However, state governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, in order to avoid public criticism and international scrutiny.
The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will result in a marked deterioration in political stability in that region. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, instances of unrest have been reported. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move will also increase the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
On October 21st assembly elections will be conducted in two states, Maharashtra and Haryana. Assembly elections for Jharkhand are expected to take place in November. The BJP and its allies currently hold over 85% of all available Lok Sabha seats in these three states, and we expect the outgoing BJP governments in all three to secure a second term in office.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they are significantly short of a majority. Given the BJP's strong performance in the general election, we now believe that the party will dominate the upcoming state elections, enabling it to nominate more members to the upper house (Rajya Sabha members are elected by state assemblies). The BJP and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are therefore expected to achieve a majority in the Rajya Sabha by mid-2021. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Tensions with Pakistan will be heightened further by the Indian government's revocation of the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the Indian government announced the revocation, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties between the two countries. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence. To this effect, India has boosted security co-operation with the US in recent years, and this will continue during our forecast period.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks in the 2019/20 (April-March) fiscal year. We believe that this sum, if delivered in full, would be sufficient to substantially address balance-sheet problems, but implementation may be a challenge.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Once the NDA has control of the Rajya Sabha, from mid-2021, this will ease the challenges in the legislative process. However we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September following the release of GDP data for April-June, which showed the economy expanding by 5%, representing the slowest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2013. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotives, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies an option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2% including various surcharges), from 30% previously, effective from fiscal year 2019/20, in order to spur private sector activity.
Fiscal stimulus measures and the revenue foregone owing to the corporate tax cut will leave a large hole in government finances. We expect the fiscal deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.8% of GDP in 2019/20. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3.2% of GDP by 2022/23. Thereafter, spending pressures will increase in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit in 2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government. It will seek to increase the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will remain significant, averaging the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP a year in 2020/21-2024/25.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits of some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. In October the RBI sanctioned a 25-basis-point reduction in the repurchase (repo) rate to 5.15%, a nine-year low. Consequently, the reverse repo rate was reduced to 4.9%. We expect the central bank to cut rates one more time in 2019, at its next monetary policy meeting in December, to provide a further lift to economic growth. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will hold rates in 2020. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
The Indian economy grew at the slowest rate in more than six years in the quarter ending June 2019. Real GDP growth slowed to 5% year on year in April-June, compared with a rate of 5.8% in the previous quarter. Depressed consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. Despite recent weak economic data, we believe that growth in most components is likely to have bottomed out and that the economy will start to regain momentum from the July-September quarter. A series of stimulus measures enacted by the government, coupled with a low-interest-rate environment, are likely to spur demand and investment in the remaining quarters of 2019/20. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 5.2% in 2019/20.
Real GDP growth is expected to recover further to an average of 6.7% in 2020/21-2021/22 as domestic demand strengthens. A recovery in global growth in 2021 will also stimulate exports; however, higher domestic investment will also suck in imports. Growth is expected to moderate to 6.4% by 2024/25 as tighter monetary conditions dampen investment growth and temper consumption. India will, nevertheless, remain among the fastest-growing major economies during the forecast period.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in the sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Lower crude oil prices will have a dampening effect on prices in 2020, but this will be more than offset by a modest pick-up in domestic demand growth, the lagged effect of interest-rate cuts and currency depreciation in 2019. Consumer price inflation is forecast to accelerate in 2020, to 4.1%, from an estimated 3.4% in 2019. An expansionary fiscal policy will also contribute to a rise in price pressures. Prices of food and oil will remain the key factors driving inflationary pressures in 2020-24. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability.
Later in the forecast period, relatively strong economic growth will stoke demand-pull inflation, while a weakening of the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will exert an upward influence on prices in 2021-23, by pushing up the cost of imports. As oil prices soften in 2024, inflation will moderate slightly in that year.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive monetary loosening stance in 2019 is expected to weigh on the exchange rate this year. The narrowing of interest-rate differentials with other economies, particularly the US, will increase depreciatory pressure on the rupee in the final months of 2019. The rupee will appreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, supported by interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) against a backdrop of an anticipated economic slowdown in the US. We expect the rupee to appreciate from an estimated average of Rs70.2:US$1 in 2019 to Rs69.4:US$1 in 2020. In the near term, the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will remain vulnerable to temporary spikes in the level of political risk in India.
In 2021-23 the rupee will return to a gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. We expect the rupee to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing in external payment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
A slowdown in merchandise imports, resulting from lower global oil prices and depressed demand for investment goods, will drive a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit in 2019. From 2020 onwards, stronger investment and higher oil prices (from 2021 onwards) will swell the import bill, reversing that trend. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP annually in 2020-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$47.5bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to higher taxes imposed on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable. We currently base our forecasts on a political transition within the five-year period (2020-24) that introduces an interim administration, which we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we view some sort of regime change as inevitable. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Our expectation of a change of government implies sweeping modifications to policymaking, as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented under the transitional and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already. The interim administration of Juan Guaidó has sought to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions-as well as potential donor nations-of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry.
The pace and depth of the adjustment measures will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of a new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands from multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals, and by the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.

Venezuela is in 78th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, up from 80th in the historical period. Assuming regime change, improvements are expected, but it will take time for reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment to bear fruit.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls, begins; concerns over political instability slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the removal of the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: Regulation by a new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt to attract investment.
2022-24: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions on private-sector access to foreign currency remain.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit very slowly.
Taxes
2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public-spending increases.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but declining risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures.
Financing
2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns around economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election of Hugo Chávez in 1998, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to an estimated US$18.8bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
The civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) is under severe economic and political pressure, and The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that its position is unsustainable. We currently expect a political transition within our 2020-24 forecast period that introduces an interim administration, which will undertake emergency adjustment measures and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. We originally assumed that regime change would take place by end-2019, but Mr Maduro has clung to power amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The timing and shape of the transition process is therefore highly uncertain. Nonetheless, we continue to believe that regime change is inevitable. The crisis has deeply damaged support for Mr Maduro among the population; we believe that it will also ultimately erode his backing among key supporters in the military who are propping him up in power. It is less clear, however, what the exact trigger for regime change will be.
There are three main paths to a political transition: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as very low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are set to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The escalation of US sanctions means that Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee the regime's raison d'être-the enrichment of its members-and we expect pragmatists within government and the military to turn on him, paving the way for some sort of political transition. However, a failed uprising on April 30th demonstrated the difficulty of this kind of initiative, and has incurred a heavy political cost, as the regime has become more vigilant of discontent among its ranks. The April uprising-which reportedly included top-ranking government officials alongside the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó-confirmed cracks in the regime's ranks at the highest levels. Our forecast for regime change therefore still stands.
This forecast is underpinned by three key assumptions. The first is that regime pragmatists will prevail over hardliners. Despite the ongoing collapse of the patronage system, there are risks to this assumption, not least frequent purges within the military. The presence of dozens of important military figures also leads to co-ordination problems. Secondly, we assume that regime members will deem amnesty offers to be credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and a fear of being prosecuted outside Venezuela (a well-founded concern, given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking against regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this assumption stem from greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, which could provide the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
We recognise the very high risks to our baseline view, and believe that there are two main alternate scenarios. The first (and more likely) is the maintenance of the status quo, with the population protest-weary, the regime hunkering down, the opposition deflating, and the country becoming increasingly isolated and impoverished. The second is one of prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict among regime factions. However, we expect neither of these scenarios to be feasible in the medium to long term. With no prospect of real reform, we believe that a chronically weak economy will ultimately make Mr Maduro's position untenable. Violent conflict in Venezuela could prove the trigger for some kind of military action by the US, or by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours, to put an end to the crisis. We continue to believe, therefore, that regime change in the forecast period remains highly likely, even if it does not occur in 2019. Despite our anticipation of a political transition, we expect political instability to persist throughout the 2020-24 forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
The opposition's plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities, and for elections within 12 months of its formation. Although this timeline is extremely ambitious-given the scale of the task-we expect national elections to take place early in our forecast period, under a transitional government. International assistance in organising elections would be necessary (and forthcoming). Deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority, the electoral registry and the voting system will be required, but rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult. If the Maduro regime manages to maintain the status quo, legislative elections would take place in December 2020. However, these elections would be neither free nor fair.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. However, efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The US introduced several rounds of sanctions, the most important of which is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad that will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September it also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism, especially ahead of the 2020 US election. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Russia may well be helping the state oil company, PDVSA, to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). However, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and the long-term future of PDVSA itself. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seemingly with little success in terms of finance for investment. We believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with a successor government in order to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
Our expectation of a government transition implies huge modifications to policymaking, as a new administration would seek to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until the transition occurs, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy in order to rein in hyperinflation and (in theory) to abandon foreign-exchange controls. However, we believe that such efforts are doomed to failure, in the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform, improvements in the rule of law and policy predictability that will not be forthcoming under the present regime.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented under the transitional and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, The prospective Guaidó administration is seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and potential donor nations-such as the US and European countries-of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and in particular, how this might be impaired by probable demands from multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals, totalling US$47bn in an initial four-year deal in 2020-23, with additional smaller agreements thereafter. We also assume a restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. Meanwhile, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself up to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit this year to remain well into double digits as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Under our expectation of substantial currency adjustment, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise dramatically in coming years. However, our forecasts assume that a combination of debt restructuring and deep fiscal adjustment will gradually bring the ratio under control. The process will be complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears, as are all but one of PDVSA's bonds. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. However, the latest US sanctions forbid the transfer of Venezuelan assets. This will (for the time being) shield Citgo and its Caribbean facilities, which the US now considers to be under Mr Guaidó's purview.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year-and a strong contraction in domestic demand-have had a temporary steadying effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise to some extent in recent months. We expect monthly inflation to rise again in the short term, as the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. However, given our assumption that a transitional government-with a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation-will come to power, we do not currently project a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018 (although there are substantial political risks to this forecast). Instead, under a new government, we expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of an emergency macroeconomic stabilisation plan. In this context, the introduction of a new currency, a temporary peg or outright currency substitution, is highly likely.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 34.1% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 66% since 2013), we expect a further slight contraction of 1% in 2020, as the economy begins to stabilise. Our forecast of an economic recovery in 2021-24 assumes a political transition that is supported by international assistance and produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP. There are downside risks to this forecast, depending on the timing of the eventual political transition. If the regime clings to power longer than expected, the economic crisis could be prolonged, delaying any recovery further.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2020, albeit less severely than in recent years, as inflation comes down from the hyperflationary rates of recent years (although it remains in triple digits). Private consumption will rise later in the forecast period assuming that political transition leads to more macroeconomic stability. We forecast a recovery in investment from 2020 under the assumption of political transition and a pick-up in oil investment. We expect oil output to bottom out at 650,000 barrels/day (b/d) by end-2019, prevented from slipping any lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government, oil production will start to recover in 2020, but even in 2024 it will still be well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will start to recover in 2020 on the back of recovery in the oil sector, but a rise in domestic demand (which has been artificially constrained) will initially absorb some of the projected increase in oil output. Import demand will rise sharply in 2020 and remain elevated through the forecast period. These factors will initially constrain the rebound of GDP, but we expect real GDP growth to gather pace in 2022-24, averaging 4.5% per year.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant gap between these and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand persist, and we expect inflation to remain high for as long as the Maduro regime stays in power. On the basis of our assumption of regime change in the short term, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation, but supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
Under our baseline forecast of inevitable political transition, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) to tackle inflation is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to predict. Our forecasts assume extremely large currency adjustments that restore some competitiveness to the local currency in real terms over time. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime has announced a loosening of currency controls. Access to dollars via formal means will remain difficult and we believe that the foreign-exchange system will stay highly controlled in practice. In this environment, a strong black-market exchange-rate premium is likely to re-emerge. At end-September the official exchange rate was BsS20,720:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of almost BsS21,300:US$1. The premium was wide, although still small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela continued to post current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. However, we estimate that the current account shifted into deficit in 2019 amid the collapse of export earnings owing to US sanctions on the oil trade-despite the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period, averaging 7% of GDP in 2020-24. The trade surplus will grow gradually as oil production comes back on stream, but this will be offset by a rise in services imports, given limited domestic capacity and dependence on foreign shipping services. Decreased interest payments (on the assumption that the new administration will secure sufficient finance) will also stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this outlook. It hinges on substantial IMF finance, rapid macroeconomic stabilisation, speedy resolution of a debt-renegotiation process, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve root-and-branch reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufactured goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Even though a multiple-exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016), but import restrictions will be widened, especially on food.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2020-24) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to restrict imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some reduction in the central bank's policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
In 2020 export earnings will fall as global oil prices decline, but imports will also fall. Imports and exports will both rise in 2021-24, and a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2020-24), as do its global and regional rankings, as the administration struggles with the reform process.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2020-21: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector remains characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2022-24: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress is slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2020-21: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals meets serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in parliament to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2022-24: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy firms are in any case hesitant to increase their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2020-21: Import bans are widened dramatically, but capital controls prove unnecessary, barring another oil price crash.
2022-24: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2020-21: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased in 2020 from 5% to 7.2% to fund a higher minimum wage, introduced in 2019.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2020-21: Domestic interest rates are high and borrowing by government crowds out the private sector. The government looks increasingly to international capital markets and wherever possible soft multilateral loans for deficit-financing.
2022-24: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2020-21: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2022-24: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2020-21: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing and higher public-sector wages. Although growth in private-sector investment is likely, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2022-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2020-21: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2022-24: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won the February 2019 presidential election and will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to restore stability across Nigeria, but managing the country's myriad security threats will prove an insuperable challenge, mainly because the military and the police are overstretched and will be unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will in effect be triaged, with resources being deployed to whichever is seen as the most pressing at any given time.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), is an urgent issue, with Islamist fighters better equipped and more capable than in recent years. As this is a ruling party stronghold, the president will be keen to reassert control. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east of Nigeria will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign will divert security forces away from pockets of instability elsewhere. One such hotspot is just to the south, in the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for land and water resources have killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be deployed to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but will not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of reduced food supplies and higher prices.
Another localised conflict with wide-ranging consequences will be militant activity in the oil-producing south, where insurgents are demanding more hydrocarbons revenue to be retained locally for development. Weak governance in the region has, as a by-product, encouraged oil theft and sabotage of pipelines and other facilities. Millions of barrels of oil are lost annually (22m in the first half of 2019). Reforming how federal revenue is allocated is a massive task and one that The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to be achieved in the forecast period. Our assumption is that attacks on oil infrastructure by aggrieved militants and saboteurs will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
In a more general sense, the military and the police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping across the country. Widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch
The next national elections will be in 2023. The previous ones, in February 2019, reaffirmed a deep electoral divide between the north, which supports the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), and the south, a stronghold of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). In 2023 custom dictates that the presidential candidates of both main parties will be from the south, giving the PDP a chance to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the 2019 presidential vote. The contest will be the opposition's to win. Nigeria's economic outlook up to the next elections does not point towards a material decrease in widespread poverty. Frustration with declining living standards and high levels of crime and instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Relations with South Africa have recently deteriorated over xenophobic attacks against Nigerians living in South Africa (and, in response, against South Africans living in Nigeria). The South African authorities have long struggled to curb xenophobic violence, and serious bouts do occasionally occur, but although the issue is emotive, it is unlikely to undermine high-level ties.
India is the largest market for Nigerian oil and will become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. For example, although Mr Buhari recently signed a continent-wide free-trade agreement, it is likely that protected sectors (notably in agriculture, where other countries would have a competitive advantage) will be shielded from foreign competition. Nigeria's closure of its border with Benin in late August over rice smuggling makes this clear-both countries had signed up to the free-trade accord together.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends
Economic policies under Mr Buhari will be interventionist, and measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be pursued. An overvalued official rate for Nigeria's currency, the naira, is critical for maintaining petrol subsidies (over 90% of petrol is imported), and Mr Buhari will not willingly reverse pump-price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of multiple exchange rates carries an ever-present risk of capital controls being imposed and will be off-putting to those acquiring illiquid assets in Nigeria; foreign direct investment inflows are expected to be equivalent to less than 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period. To defend foreign reserves and the official rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will probably widen import restrictions in 2020 as the average price of oil falls. Impetus to this policy will also come from a British court ruling that an Irish natural gas firm can apply to seize US$9bn in Nigerian government assets in the UK and potentially in 160 other countries.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned companies such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. Generally, the preference of the Buhari administration will be to clean up loss-making state companies rather than relinquish control over them. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint ventures it has with international oil companies, but uncertainty about fiscal terms (with proposed legislation to reform the management of hydrocarbons revenue having stalled) means that investor interest will fall short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off key public assets cheaply. As a result, the NNPC will continue to dominate the oil sector.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes and a planned increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 5% now to 7.2% in 2020. Revenue increases will be from an extremely low base, however, and the new VAT rate is still among the world's lowest. Tax avoidance is widespread, and instability impedes collection in many parts of the country. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and overambitious oil production targets mean that budgeted revenue targets will not be reached. For example, in 2020 the government expects output of 2.2m barrels/day-a level that has not been seen since the oil price slump, and that is unobtainable given underinvestment and OPEC production quotas. Federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.8% of GDP.
There is a clear need to address the budget deficit, and with revenue being so low the approach to spending will be austerity-minded early in the forecast period. Generally, fiscal flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, as a result, revenue-under pressure and with considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. We expect an average budget deficit of 1.8% of GDP a year in 2020-24, with the highest shortfall (2% of GDP) in the election year of 2023. These will be financed externally and by soft loans wherever possible, but the bulk of finance will come from commercial debt and local borrowing.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against an abnormally low revenue base. Debt service can take up to half of federal revenue, which is alarming even by heavily-indebted emerging-market standards. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The CBN is inclined towards boosting the supply side of the economy, but inflation is well above the targeted upper limit of 9% and monetary loosening in 2020 could lead to capital outflows and put downward pressure on the naira at a time of low oil prices. Overall, we do not expect rates to move much in 2020, thus keeping bond yields in Nigeria attractive to foreign capital as monetary policy in the US loosens. Our baseline forecast is that interest rates will fall from 2021 as inflation enters a sustained downward trend, giving the CBN a chance to act on its growth-first strategy. We also expect that oil prices will rise in 2021-23, driving higher foreign-exchange inflows and lessening the need to support the naira through portfolio inflows.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth
Economic growth will remain weak but will pick up as the forecast period progresses. In 2020 the economy will grow by just 2%, unchanged from 2019, held back by power shortages, insecurity, high inflation and tight credit conditions. With high debt-servicing costs leaving no room for fiscal activism, monetary policy is the main lever that can drive a recovery. In 2021, as global markets strengthen and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for some monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken to 2.9% and to an annual average of 3.2% in 2021-24, although this remains well below potential.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agricultural growth will be lacklustre. Although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will drive higher condensate output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery that is due to come on stream by late 2021 will boost downstream oil activity and wider economic growth in 2022-24. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of electricity shortages, as well as cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by the impact of protectionism on trade (which accounts for over 15% of GDP) and by the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation
After averaging an estimated 11.4% in 2019, inflation will stay high in 2020, at 11.3%, well above the CBN's target ceiling of 9%, because of widening foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of manufactures and food at a time of sluggish economic growth and so inadequate local supply. The hike in VAT from 5% to 7.2% will likewise push up consumer prices across multiple index categories. With base effects from this fading, and with oil prices rising (reducing the need for further import restrictions as a means of defending the naira), core inflation will gradually ease over the remainder of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it to an average of 8.3% in 2024. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-will prevent a faster slide.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2020-24, with an official rate for government business and a more market-determined rate for investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors or firms (including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate) deemed important for economic or political reasons.
The central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, has proven willing to adopt unconventional measures to keep the naira stable, which he argues is essential to avoid an inflationary spike and capital flight. As oil prices decline in 2020, foreign-exchange restrictions will be widened to curb what has been a surge in import demand, but there will not be a need for capital controls (which were introduced temporarily in 2016). Easier global monetary conditions in 2020 will support the naira through portfolio inflows. Higher global crude prices thereafter will continue to support the official rate.
Currency stability means steady real appreciation of the naira against the currencies of Nigeria's trading partners as inflation remains high relative to those countries. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue in order to regain international competitiveness for the non-oil sector. However, the CBN's industrial strategy (the central bank has long had similarities with a development agency) is focused on supplying the domestic market and such an eventuality is not forecast. We forecast that the naira will weaken to an average of N313.7:US$1 in 2024, from an estimated average of N306.6:US$1 in 2019.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. It also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector
Export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. In 2020 falling oil prices will offset rising production and cause earnings to decline. In 2021-23 higher global prices and output gains (with a new mega-refinery due to come on stream in 2021, which we expect to be export-oriented) will lead to a return to strong export growth, which will slow in 2024 as oil prices retreat again.
The government promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural products). After a sharp rise in purchases across various import categories in 2019, widening import restrictions will cause the import bill to drop back in 2020. Lower oil-and so petrol-prices that year (refinery capacity is low, and Nigeria imports much of its petrol) will also have a dampening effect. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise, imports will grow.
Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, although they will dip in 2020 as growth falters in the US, which is home to a large Nigerian diaspora. Overall, the current-account surplus will widen from an estimated 0.7% of GDP in 2019 to a high of 2.2% of GDP in 2023 as imports fall (2020) and exports-of both crude oil and refined products-rise (2021-23). In 2024, as oil prices slide, the surplus will ease to 2% of GDP.

Full text: South Africa--highlights: Political outlook
An election win for the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in May 2019, albeit with a reduced vote share, gives the president, Cyril Ramaphosa a full five-year term. The ANC's installation of Mr Ramaphosa, a pragmatic and reputable figure, as president in February 2018-in place of the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma-helped to restore the party's fortunes and has positive implications for politics, society and the economy. Mr Ramaphosa faces a range of challenges, including the fragile state of the economy (marked by weak growth and high unemployment) and persistent divisions within the ANC, both between reformers and resisters, and between the pragmatic centre and the interventionist left-wing. A failure to push ahead with economic reforms could erode ANC support at municipal elections in 2021 and the next general election in 2024.

South Africa falls to 56th in the business environment ranking in 2019-23 as improvements in market opportunities and infrastructure are offset by declines in the macroeconomic environment, political stability and taxes. Supporting factors include a sound banking system, disciplined monetary policy, investment in infrastructure and the expanding black middle class. Constraints include skills shortages, frequent strikes, strict labour laws and the burden of complying with black economic empowerment regulations. Other areas of controversy are a reworked mining charter, which loosens some rules while tightening others, and a proposal to embrace expropriation without compensation to speed up land reform, although we believe that this will be limited in extent, limiting the threat to property rights. Opportunities for public-private partnerships will increase.

South Africa's economy, being relatively small and open, will remain vulnerable to global developments, such as the US-China trade war, and to commodity price fluctuations. Growth will pick up from 2020 onwards, driven by consumption and investment, and improved sentiment. However, expansion will happen too slowly to reduce high unemployment levels, which continue to constrain demand. Fiscal consolidation will also limit growth. Global developments will put pressure on the rand, but the inflation outlook is relatively benign, and we expect interest rates to move within a fairly narrow band. The budget and current-account deficits will trend lower in 2019-23.

South Africa's population growth rate will remain muted in 2019-23, averaging just 1.2% a year, constrained by the adverse impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The number of new infections and the annual death toll from AIDS are both on downward trends, and life expectancy is rising, helped by the expansion of treatment programmes, but the damage will persist into the medium term. The labour force will grow at a faster rate than the overall population, highlighting the urgency of job creation.

South Africa's market will expand during the forecast period as the poor black majority becomes increasingly engaged with the mainstream commercial economy, boosting demand for a wide range of goods and services. The high unemployment level will, however, continue dragging on aggregate demand, aggravated by fiscal consolidation. An uptick in GDP growth, higher levels of financial inclusion, the spread of digital technology, regional economic integration and infrastructure investment (including in low-cost housing and power supply) will underpin market opportunities.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
We forecast that real GDP growth will quicken to 3.6% a year on average in 2019-30, helped by rising life expectancy, improved healthcare, investment in infrastructure, regional integration and global commodity demand. Technological advances, such as cloud computing and 3D printing, will give a further boost to growth and productivity. Growth will quicken to 4.3% a year in 2031-50 as the ICT revolution gathers momentum and African integration deepens. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period, owing to a combination of skills shortages and investment in new technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Mr Ramaphosa will now serve a full-five years as president and would be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The 400-member National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: Boosting growth, creating jobs, advancing black economic empowerment and reducing inequality-while maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline-are the main policy aims. Mr Ramaphosa's election victory in May 2019 heralds deeper economic reform, but persistent divisions within the ANC will impede progress. Advances to date include restarting a private-sector-led renewable energy programme and reworking the mining charter, but the labour market will remain rigid and marked by frequent strikes, exacerbated by the trade unions' political power. Skills shortages will persist, reflecting weaknesses in education. The environment for private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, marked by opportunities for public-private partnerships, but policy uncertainty will persist, including over land reform, owing to ANC backing for expropriation without compensation, albeit in limited circumstances. Competition law, a new national minimum wage and a new carbon tax are other areas of concern.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2019/20 budget. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for around 52% of GDP in 2016. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important, and it is the only region with which South Africa has a trade surplus.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The African National Congress (ANC), the dominant political party since the 1994 election ended apartheid and white minority rule, retained power in May 2019, although with a smaller voting share of 57.5%. This marks a worst-ever showing for the ANC in general elections and comes after a steady fall from a peak of 69.7% in 2004, when Thabo Mbeki was president, to 65.9% in 2009 and 62.2% in 2014, when Jacob Zuma held office. Mr Zuma's growing unpopularity, largely linked to corruption, saw the ANC's vote tumble to just 54% in municipal elections in 2016, but the party's replacement of Mr Zuma by Cyril Ramaphosa in February 2018 led to a mild bounce in the 2019 general election. The ANC continues to hold a large majority of seats in parliament under South Africa's proportional representation system of voting. The party also retained eight of the nine provinces in 2019. The ANC rules in partnership with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in a tripartite alliance.
Opposition: The Democratic Alliance (DA), which draws most of its support from minority voters (white, mixed-race and Indian), saw its vote share ebb to 20.8% in 2019, down from 22.2% in 2014, partly because of defections by conservative whites angered by the party's bid to strengthen its appeal to black urban voters. Under Mmusi Maimane, the DA's first black leader, elected in 2015, the party made strong gains in 2016's municipal polls but could not maintain the momentum in 2019 because of internal splits and the ANC's "Ramaphosa bounce". The populist Economic Freedom Fighters (EEF), founded by Julius Malema in 2013 after his expulsion from the ANC, was the main gainer in 2019, lifting its vote to 10.8%, up from 6.4% in 2014, although it failed to make a major breakthrough. The two other main opposition parties are the KwaZulu-Natal-based Inkatha Freedom Party, and Freedom Front Plus (a conservative white party), which both made small gains in 2019, taking 3.4% and 2.4% of the vote respectively.

Political outlook: Political stability
Mr Ramaphosa, re-elected president by the new National Assembly on May 22nd-after the ANC won a comfortable (albeit smaller) majority in the May 8th general election-faces a series of political and economic challenges during his five-year term. After 15 months as interim president before the election, Mr Ramaphosa will now have greater authority to shape the policy agenda and the structure of government, and drive through reforms. Nevertheless, he faces numerous obstacles, both political and economic. Boosting investment, growth and job creation, overhauling Eskom (the dysfunctional power parastatal) in the face of trade union resistance, sustaining the crackdown on corruption, and tackling policy conundrums such as land reform are among the major tests confronting the new government. Aggravating these challenges, Mr Ramaphosa faces deep divisions in the ANC, both between reformers and resisters-exemplified by supporters of the former president, Jacob Zuma (2009-18)-and between centrists and the left wing, including the trade unions. Politics will limit Mr Ramaphosa's room for manoeuvre, especially given the ANC's election losses, to recently formed parties like Julius Malema's radical, populist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).
Mr Ramaphosa's new cabinet illustrates both his ambitions and his problems. Several key ministers already appointed by the president remain in place, such as Tito Mboweni at the Ministry of Finance and Pravin Gordhan at the Ministry of Public Enterprises. The ANC's diversity requires a broad-based cabinet, however, hence the inclusion of prominent left-wingers (such as Ebrahim Patel), veterans, rising stars and some pro-Zuma figures, although several of Mr Zuma's acolytes were omitted (or left parliament). Cabinet divisions pose some risks, although a greater threat to the president's authority comes from the ANC hierarchy, wherein pro-Zuma figures, such as the secretary-general, Ace Magashule, are more entrenched. Mr Ramaphosa is also threatened by the seemingly biased public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane (appointed by Mr Zuma in 2016), who is probing both Mr Gordhan and the president. However, court rulings against Ms Mkhwebane's previous reports-including fresh legal setbacks in August-have damaged her credibility.
Being a persuasive negotiator with experience of both business and organised labour, Mr Ramaphosa is well suited to the tasks ahead. Having already acted to revitalise key institutions that Mr Zuma weakened, such as the National Prosecuting Authority and the South African Revenue Service, the president will focus on further institutional reforms. A judge-led inquiry into "state capture" could lead to several prosecutions. But reforms will take time to deliver benefits, given objections from vested interests (such as patronage networks and trade unions), leading to pressure from impatient voters and the emboldened EFF ahead of municipal elections in 2021. Moreover, not all changes will be positive, with the ANC committed to land expropriation without compensation (albeit in limited circumstances), in a bid to reduce the EFF's appeal. A failure to revive the economy could see Mr Ramaphosa's leadership challenged at the ANC's next electoral summit in 2022. Economic stagnation also raises the risk of increased civil unrest.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Government effectiveness declined during Mr Zuma's presidency (2009-18) because of a steady rise in corruption and patronage, and his appointment of cronies to key positions in vital institutions, such as the National Prosecuting Agency, which eroded their independence and credibility. The ANC's ousting of Mr Zuma in February 2018, and his replacement by Mr Ramaphosa, a pragmatic, experienced and reputable figure, heralds a significant transformation, including a crackdown on corrupt networks and the rebuilding of institutional integrity, although progress will be gradual and subject to occasional setbacks, given the embedded nature of patronage networks and divisions within the ruling party. Key actions taken by Mr Ramaphosa, who was handed a full five-year term in the May 2019 election, include removing the Zuma-appointed heads of both the South African Revenue Service and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in 2018-on the grounds of adverse legal judgements-and installing competent figures in their place in 2019. The NPA, now under Shamila Batohi, will regain its credibility and effectiveness, although, as with other institutions subject to rebuilding, the process will be gradual, given the expertise lost during years of mismanagement and government interference.
The Constitutional Court-the arbiter of South Africa's widely respected and painstakingly negotiated post-apartheid constitution-alongside the wider judicial system, played a key role in holding Mr Zuma to account, and is one of the few key institutions, alongside the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank), that escaped being weakened by the former president. The battle against corruption and patronage will gather momentum, helped by an ongoing inquiry into Mr Zuma's agenda of "state capture"-led by a respected judge, Raymond Zondo-that kicked off in August 2018. Mr Zondo will not report back until 2020 at the earliest, but in conjunction with other anti-corruption probes, some of the architects of state capture, including Mr Zuma, could be prosecuted and jailed. Mr Zuma also faces a possible trial over corruption charges laid-then controversially dropped-before he became president in 2009. Exposing past corruption and punishing the perpetrators is vital for democratic deepening and government effectiveness.
South Africa's political system is robust, underpinned by the constitution, which provides for a clear separation of powers (between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary) and strong, independent institutions. Despite the serious damage caused by Mr Zuma, the fightback by the judiciary and other organs of state, and by his opponents in the ANC, illustrates the underlying strength of the political architecture. There are, however, some weaknesses that work against effective government. The electoral code, based on pure proportional representation and a party list system, means that there is no direct link between members of parliament and their constituents, which gives Luthuli House (the ANC headquarters) and the executive much greater influence over legislators than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the ANC's large parliamentary majority, coupled with opposition weaknesses, means that many important debates are hidden from public view within the party hierarchy. Trends suggest that ANC dominance will fade as opposition influence rises, which is positive for democracy, but lower turnout in the 2019 election highlights the risk of disengagement, especially if the economy continues underperforming.
Political outlook: Election watch
The ANC's vote share fell in May 2019 for the third consecutive general election, to an all-time low of 57.5% (down from 62.1% in 2014), although the party retained a comfortable majority, to claim 230 out of the 400 National Assembly seats under South Africa's system of proportional representation. The ruling party's losses would have been greater, however, had the ANC not replaced the graft-tainted Mr Zuma as president with Mr Ramaphosa in February 2018. The increase in the EFF's vote share (to 10.8%, up from 6.4% in 2014) and its seat tally (to 41, from 25) almost exactly mirrors the ANC's decline, but it failed to make a major breakthrough, held back by the ANC's "Ramaphosa bounce".
The centrist Democratic Alliance (DA) remains the official opposition, but it saw its vote share dip (to 20.8%, down from 22.2%), along with its seat tally (to 84, down from 89), because of defections by white, conservative voters to VF Plus, which gained six seats, taking its tally to ten, aggrieved by the DA's bid to attract more black voters.
Radical parties therefore benefited the most, although the shifts in voting patterns since 2014 were not dramatic. A greater concern, from the perspective of democratic engagement, is a sharp drop in turnout to 66%, down from 72.4% in 2014, indicating growing disenchantment with the government and the wider political system. This damaging trend, and the drift of voters towards radical parties, will continue in the absence of economic revival. The ANC therefore faces a stiff test at municipal elections in 2021, and could lose its national majority for the first time in 2024.
Political outlook: International relations
South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa-will play an important role in regional and global affairs, facilitated by a third stint on the UN Security Council in 2019-20. The country will remain deeply engaged in Africa, particularly Southern Africa, and will continue to support peacekeeping operations in the continent's conflict zones. Mr Ramaphosa will be the next chair of the African Union in 2020. South Africa will also seek to build closer "South-South" ties, especially within the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) grouping and with other African trade blocs, including the under-negotiation African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The prioritisation of African ties partly explains South Africa's decision in 2016 to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which some observers argue targets the continent unfairly. However, the country's High Court ruled in 2017 that departing the ICC would require fresh legislation, leaving South Africa's membership in the balance.

Opportunities will be mixed with uncertainties
South Africa's business environment ranking for 2019-23 declines (to 56th) at the global level, but does not change at the regional level. As a key emerging market (and the most advanced economy in Africa), with vast mineral reserves, sound banks and a broad commitment to free markets, the country will remain an important business centre. However, improvements in some areas, such as infrastructure and market opportunities, will be offset by declines in the macroeconomic environment and taxes, because of subdued growth and higher tax levels, respectively.
Business also confronts a wide range of policy uncertainties, aggravated by divisions within the ruling African National Congress (ANC). One key controversy is the ANC's decision to embrace expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects any such moves to apply in limited circumstances only, thereby limiting the threat to property rights. Uncertainties also surround an improved but still flawed mining charter, as well as a new investment law that requires any disputes to be settled in the local courts, rather than via international arbitration.
An election win for the ANC in May 2019 and Cyril Ramaphosa's installation as president for a full five-year term have positive policy implications. However, room for manoeuvre is limited by divisions in the party between reformers and resisters on the one hand, and between centrists and left-wingers on the other. Mr Ramaphosa's successes to date include cracking down on corruption, strengthening institutions and restarting a private-sector renewable energy programme. Political sensitivities preclude labour market deregulation or outright privatisation. Despite the obstacles-and the damage caused by years of mismanagement under the former president, Jacob Zuma-we believe that reform will gather pace as Mr Ramaphosa increasingly asserts his authority.

Business environment outlook: South Africa's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Policy is broadly pro-business, but favourable moves, such as new special economic zones offering tax incentives, are accompanied by tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2021-23: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.

The macroeconomic environment score declines in the forecast period, pushing down South Africa's global ranking to 65th (from 53rd) and its regional ranking to ninth (from sixth). Real GDP growth will remain sluggish, averaging just 2.3% a year in 2019-23, but will show an upward trend, from 0.8% in 2019 to 3.4% in 2023, driven by consumption and investment. However, growth will remain vulnerable to adverse global developments-such as an escalating US-China trade war and a disorderly Brexit-and to domestic policy uncertainties. Growth will also be insufficient to bring down the high unemployment rate, which hit 29% in June 2019. The possible loss of South Africa's remaining investment-grade credit rating in 2020, because of fiscal slippage, would also have a negative impact via higher borrowing costs, but a downgrade may be avoided.
An interest rate cut in July will have a mildly positive impact, especially if followed by another cut in 2019/20, although South Africa's weak growth mainly reflects structural, not monetary, constraints. The current-account deficit will remain a source of vulnerability, but it will move within a fairly narrow 4-4.5% of GDP range in 2019-22, and will decline after 2020, dropping to 3.7% in 2023. The rand-a widely traded and market-determined currency-will maintain a weakening trend, albeit with high levels of volatility, although the pace of depreciation will taper off towards the end of the forecast period. Annual inflation will stay comfortably within the 3-6% target range set by the South Africa Reserve Bank (the central bank) in 2019-23, despite temporary breaches, underpinned by prudent monetary policy and weak growth in demand.
The challenge of black economic empowerment
A unique, challenging and controversial aspect of South Africa's policy environment is black economic empowerment (BEE), which aims to redress the iniquities of the apartheid era-whereby most wealth and assets ended up in the hands of the white minority-by gradually transferring economic power to the black majority. Legislation governing BEE includes sector-specific charters and broader codes of conduct, both of which set targets for ownership and other variables. Broadly speaking, BEE requires firms to have 25% black ownership, although the precise figure varies by sector (and foreign subsidiaries are largely exempt from equity transfer rules). Revised codes of practice, which came into force in 2015, cut the number of elements on a company's BEE scorecard from seven to five-ownership, enterprise and supplier development, skills development, management control, and socioeconomic development-and reweighted the components. Alongside other changes, this will make it harder for firms to earn (or retain) a BEE-compliant rating: non-compliant firms will be at a competitive disadvantage when bidding for government contracts or negotiating public-private partnerships.
Apart from the problems posed by changes to the rules, two key questions remain unanswered after nearly two decades of BEE: how long will the policy remain in force, and is a once-empowered company always empowered? The reworked mining charter in 2018 partly answers the latter question, by allowing BEE deals that have lapsed (because of new black owners selling their shares) to count towards a firm's equity transfer target, although the concession requires certain conditions to be met and does not necessarily apply outside of mining. Less positively, the new charter plans to lift the ownership threshold in mining to 30%. With regard to wealth transfer, the record of BEE has been mixed: the initial benefits were spread fairly narrowly (helping to create a new, black elite), although a drive towards more broad-based empowerment (by including workers and suppliers, for example), is distributing the rewards more evenly. Some company BEE schemes yield higher benefits than others, however, depending on several variables, such as share price movements

Policy towards private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, but several policy-related challenges will persist, leading to a small decline in South Africa's global and regional rankings. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) will become more commonplace, but obstacles such as strict labour laws, elevated strike risks and skills shortages will persist. In addition, taxes are trending higher because of fiscal pressures. Key areas of uncertainty are the reworked mining charter-which eases BEE requirements in some areas while tightening them in others-and government plans to embrace expropriation without compensation to speed land reform. Proposals to phase in a new National Health Insurance system are a particular concern for large private-sector providers. Mr Ramaphosa's installation as president in May for a full five-year term heralds faster reforms, but the challenge facing the government of reconciling the imperatives of growth with those of socioeconomic transformation will persist.
Powerful parastatals (such as the power generator, Eskom, and the port and rail operator, Transnet) will continue to play a key role, despite suffering from weak management, political interference and financial indiscipline. Parastatal overreach and the government's resistance to outright privatisation imposes limits on private opportunity, although openings for PPPs-including the possible injection of private capital into ailing state-owned firms-and independent initiatives will increase, especially in the energy sector, given the proposed unbundling of Eskom into generation, distribution and transmission arms. Industrial policy will continue to offer incentives in some sectors, especially for vehicle manufacturing, incentives for which have now been extended beyond 2020. Tax concessions are on offer to investors in new special economic zones (SEZs), of which six have been designated, although some restrictions apply. Existing industrial development zones will switch to the SEZ format.
Expropriation without compensation unsettles investors
The ANC's decision to embrace expropriation without compensation, in order to speed up land reform-which has so far taken place mostly on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis-could pose a threat to property rights, depending on the rules adopted. However, we believe that expropriation, if any, will apply in limited, clearly defined circumstances only, and will not extend beyond land. As a first step, the government plans to amend the constitution to specifically allow for expropriation without compensation, but this will require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is by no means guaranteed. The failure of the land reform programme to meet targets has little to do with the constitution, however, and largely reflects weaknesses in land-related policies and institutions. Plans for expropriation without compensation, even with clear limits, will weigh on sentiment until the details are clarified.
Competition policy is becoming stricter
Policy towards anti-competitive practices will become stricter, as the competition authorities (comprising a commission and a tribunal)-under the newly-expanded Department of Trade and Industry-intensify their battle against cartels, overpricing and barriers to entry, which are relatively high in South Africa, given the entrenched positions of several large local firms. An amended competition act, signed into law in February 2019, gives the competition authorities (and the relevant minister, Ebrahim Patel) additional powers, allowing them to launch inquiries into sectors with a high degree of concentration and intervene in mergers on public-interest grounds. There are legitimate concerns about competition policy being increasingly used as a tool to promote wider socio-economic objectives (such as black economic empowerment-BEE), although rulings made by the competition authorities, including recent determinations, are more practical than ideological. Conditions imposed on takeovers and mergers mainly relate to developing local suppliers and retaining workers (for a set period), which are not typically deal-breakers. Gaining competition authority approval can be time consuming, however, and the stricter new act could see more stringent remedies applied in some cases.

Policy uncertainties could hamper FDI inflows
South Africa will remain a key destination for non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa during the forecast period, in a wide range of sectors, driven by market opportunities and the country's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent, especially Southern Africa. This will facilitate a small improvement in South Africa's global ranking during the forecast period, despite the persistence of policy uncertainties. Foreign investors, for the most part, face the same challenges as domestic firms, including strict labour and competition laws, the dominant position of parastatals and concern about future property rights. Conversely, foreign (and local) investors, will be drawn by opportunities for PPPs, notably in renewable energy. A reworked mining charter, issued in 2018, could buoy investment, but some aspects need clarification. In a key concession to business, the revised charter allows previous BEE deals that were subsequently unwound to count towards the 26% equity threshold, but also imposes new restrictions, such as lifting the threshold to 30%. The courts may be asked to rule on the remaining areas of contention. Foreign investors seeking domestic acquisitions can face scrutiny from the competition authorities, as happened during Walmart's purchase of a majority stake in Massmart in 2011, although the conditions attached to deals, such as supplier development, are typically not too onerous. Pepsi's US$1.7bn bid for Pioneer, a consumer goods firm), in July will provide the next major challenge for the competition authorities.
A new Protection of Investment Act, sometimes referred to as the FDI Act, which came into force in July 2018 following lengthy delays, is creating new uncertainties. The law aims to provide a more streamlined environment for FDI (compared with previous ad hoc arrangements) and is based on treating local and foreign investors more equally. However, the act also limits investor access to international arbitration and instead requires all legal disputes to be first dealt with by local courts. Investors may be assuaged by South Africa's respected constitution and independent judiciary, but changing the rules generates inevitable uncertainty. South Africa's termination (or failure to extend) around a dozen bilateral investment treaties with EU countries, in the belief that they have little impact on actual investment flows, is a similar concern. More positively, the new law appears not to be harming FDI, which picked up strongly in 2018. FDI will be driven in part by opportunities for PPPs, as well as private-led initiatives, especially in the field of infrastructure provision. For example, private firms, both foreign and local, are playing a leading role in the rollout of renewable energy (especially solar and wind), having invested almost US$14bn to date, with more projects in the pipeline.

Exchange controls will gradually be liberalised
South Africa maintains some controls on outbound capital flows (although not on inflows), but is loosening the rules, in stages, and moving from centralised directives towards prudential self-regulation. Liberalisation stalled during the 2008-09 global financial crisis (as controls offered some protection, by constraining capital flight), but then regained momentum, driven by Treasury-led reforms. These include removing the ceiling for outward investment; lowering the ceiling on advance payments for imports; allowing South African companies to open foreign bank accounts without prior approval; permitting banks to invest 25% of their liabilities in offshore portfolio instruments; and offering concessions to foreign firms that set up headquarters in South Africa. Other changes have loosened the rules for outward investment in Africa. Additional reforms are probable during the forecast period, but some restrictions will remain in place, especially given the risks that US-led protectionism-and consequent trade wars-pose to the global financial system.
Sluggish growth, combined with an activist industrial policy, will lead to protective measures in some cases (in the form of higher tariffs and anti-dumping duties)-such as for steel-although South Africa will seek to remain compliant with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) will progressively implement a free-trade area, but the initiative is running behind schedule because of wide economic and policy divergences between member states. Loftier ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union will not be realised during the outlook period. Other free trade plans are advancing, including the proposed merger of SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the East African Community into a Tripartite Free-Trade Area (TFTA), and a more recent initiative-the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)-which formally launched in July. However, both the TFTA and the AfCFTA still require lengthy negotiations, and it may be impractical for them to co-exist. Non-tariff barriers and poor infrastructure links are other serious obstacles.
South Africa (and other members of the Southern Africa Customs Union-SACU) successfully negotiated a new economic partnership agreement with the EU in 2014. The deal will facilitate deeper trade and investment ties, and provides improved access to the EU for South African agricultural exports. The UK's intended departure from the EU poses risks: negotiations on a standalone SACU-UK deal are ongoing. South Africa will also retain trade preferences in the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years to 2025. Nonetheless, South Africa's AGOA status will remain conditional on its policies towards trade liberalisation and investment protection. A dispute about South African restrictions on US meat imports, for example, threatened South Africa's AGOA eligibility before the issue was settled in 2016. US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from most countries, including South Africa, imposed in 2018, violate the spirit of AGOA, but South Africa is unlikely to retaliate. US protectionism poses clear risks to AGOA and to South Africa-US trade and investment relations.

Tight fiscal conditions lead to higher taxes
South Africa's score and global ranking for taxes decline in 2019-23, as revenue shortfalls combine with spending pressures to push the tax burden higher. The budget for fiscal year 2018/19 (April-March), for example, lifted the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 15%, from 14%, the first adjustment for 25 years, and also increased fuel duties. This follows hikes in capital gains tax and income tax, including a new top rate of 45%, in fiscal-year 2016/17. However, the corporation tax rate remains unchanged, at 28%, and is unlikely to be raised, given pressures on corporate finances. Other levies include property and labour-related taxes, such as a skills development levy and contributions towards unemployment insurance.
Additional tax increases are probable during the forecast period, given spending pressures, although the government's room for manoeuvre is now more limited: another VAT hike would be politically damaging and there is limited scope for higher income-tax rates (which could lead to increased evasion). Other forms of wealth tax will be considered, but South Africa already relies too heavily on a small number of rich individuals and firms, and instead needs to broaden the tax base. Efforts to streamline taxation, boost compliance and seal loopholes will continue during the forecast period, informed by the findings of the Davis Tax Committee, which produced a string of reports during its five-year probe, ending in April 2018. South Africa's revenue shortfalls also reflect mismanagement at the South African Revenue Service (SARS) under the former commissioner, Tom Moyane, appointed by Mr Zuma in 2014 and sacked by Mr Ramaphosa in 2018 after a legal probe. With the experienced Edward Kieswetter now leading the SARS, revenue collection will improve, reducing the urgency of tax rises.
Tax incentives will continue to apply in some cases, including for small firms, which have enjoyed reduced corporation tax rates since 2013. A youth employment subsidy (via tax concessions) dating from 2014 will now remain in place until 2029, following a ten-year extension. A discounted 15% rate of corporate tax also applies to investors in new SEZs; the first six SEZs were formally designated in August 2018. The 2018/19 budget allocated R350m to cover tax incentives in SEZs. New environmental and health-related taxes will be introduced during the forecast period, as highlighted by a new sugar tax on soft drinks imposed on April 1st 2018, alongside a higher levy on plastic bags. In addition, a long-mooted carbon tax finally came into force in June 2019, geared towards curbing emissions. Criticised by the green lobby for being too low, and by business for being too high, the impact will be relatively small in the initial phase, until end-2022, because of exemptions available. A major review will precede phase two, running from 2023-30, making the outcome uncertain. The carbon tax will pose risks to profit, but will also encourage innovation.

Banks remain sound and well-capitalised
The banking system remains sound and well-capitalised, with a long-term reputation for stability, underpinned by an effective regulatory and supervisory framework, overseen by the SARB. Key challenges are slow GDP growth (and hence demand for credit) and a range of regulatory uncertainties. Banks' capital-adequacy ratios remain comfortably above prescribed minimums, and profitability (as measured by return on equity) remains satisfactory despite dipping to 15.3% in June 2019, down from 16.3% in June 2018. Credit growth to households has regained buoyancy in 2019, rising to 6.5% year on year in June, a multi-year high. Credit growth to firms is higher, but more volatile. Economic strains pushed up the bad-debt ratio to 3.7% in June 2019, but it will remain comfortably below the critical 5% threshold in 2019-23, barring shocks. Interest rates will remain broadly stable during the forecast period, with small hikes interspersed by small cuts. Local banks will remain a key source of funds for private investment projects, as illustrated by their participation in financing renewable energy projects. Other key sources of financing are the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and, to an increasing extent, local development finance institutions such as the Industrial Development Corporation.
The four dominant banks-ABSA (formerly Barclays Africa), Nedbank, Standard and First Rand-are world-class players with strong international links. They are also, to varying degrees, expanding their presence in the rest of Africa, thereby cementing South Africa's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent. The withdrawal of Barclays from Africa, largely completed in 2017, poses no threat to the local banking system; the bank's African operation has now been rebranded as ABSA (its former name). The implementation of an amended Financial Intelligence Centre Act in June 2017, meeting a deadline set by the Financial Action Task Force, removes a threat to the credibility and integrity of local banks and will help to tackle money-laundering. However, the phased implementation of more stringent Basel III regulatory standards ahead of the extended 2022 deadline, alongside a new financial sector regulation bill based on a Twin Peaks model, may impose additional costs.
A key policy challenge is a possible change to BEE rules in the financial sector, which are comparatively loose at present. A new credit-relief act, signed into law in August 2019, is causing some concern because of a potential debt write-off for poor borrowers. But the impact may be small, especially for large banks, which have little exposure to the low-income segment. Poor borrowers could suffer, however, because lenders will struggle to price risk correctly. Government plans to embrace land expropriation without compensation represent a fundamental threat to banks (given the amount of land used as loan collateral), although we expect the government to set clear limits on expropriation. Another danger is the exposure of banks to heavily indebted parastatals. The possible nationalisation of the SARB-a rare privately owned central bank-is unsettling, but would be of symbolic value only, provided its mandate was left untouched. Banks raised no objection to a new law passed in March 2019 allowing for a state-owned bank, provided all banks are treated equally.

The labour market will remain characterised by strict regulations, partly owing to the political power of the trade unions, despite the negative impact on job creation. The official unemployment rate hit a new high of 29% in the second quarter of 2019-rising to 36.6% with the inclusion of discouraged job seekers-partly because of slow GDP growth, but also because of tight labour laws. The employment equity requirements of BEE, for example, and the limits imposed on casual, temporary employment deter firms from hiring, as does the high risk of strike action. A labour movement split in 2017 saw many unions break away from the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu, an ANC ally) to found the more radical South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu). This partly weakened the labour voice but brings new challenges for firms, as most unionised workers in the private sector are now Saftu members, leaving Cosatu as the dominant force in the public sector.
The introduction of a national minimum wage on January 1st 2019 will have an uncertain impact on the labour market. By setting the initial rate at a relatively low level of R20 (US$13.50) an hour-with a discounted rate applying to domestic service and agriculture for a temporary period-and by allowing for exemptions, the government hopes that any associated job losses will be minimal, but the evidence to date is unclear. The national minimum wage could create new jobs, by boosting the spending power of up to 5m low-paid workers (a third of the total), but could also lead to retrenchments in some cases, leaving the net result uncertain. The existing system of sector-based minimum wages will be retained, despite its complexity, to protect workers earning more than the national minimum. A Minimum Wage Commission will monitor the impact and make recommendations on future increments (to account for inflation). In return for agreeing to the national minimum wage, business secured commitments from mainstream trade unions to increase the use of pre-strike balloting, via an amendment to the Labour Relations Act, which may reduce the incidence of industrial action.
Shortages of skilled workers will remain a key constraint
One the biggest labour-market challenges is a shortage of skills, stemming from weaknesses in the education system at all levels, exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Skills shortages will remain prevalent in most sectors, pushing up the premium required to attract skilled workers and leading to the poaching of capable staff. South Africa's top universities have a good reputation but are failing to alleviate the shortage, especially of technical and engineering skills. The deficit is being aggravated by outward migration of skilled workers and overly restrictive rules on immigration. We expect a relaxation of immigration rules to help tackle the problem.

Parastatals restrict opportunities in transport
South Africa's transport network is well-developed by African standards, despite some bottlenecks, although the strong parastatal presence, including Transnet (for most freight railways and ports), Prasa (for passenger railways) and Sanral (for roads), limits opportunities for private providers. Moreover, weak parastatal governance can lead to cost overruns, project delays and workforce bloat. Privatisation is politically sensitive, but PPPs are, nonetheless, playing an important role, as illustrated by the Gauteng mass-transit railway, which opened, in phases, in 2010-12 and may be extended. The partnership between the privately-owned Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa's largest, and Transnet, which operates the railway serving the terminal, represents a different form of PPP. The government's bid to finance Gauteng's highways via a tolling system continues to face resistance from drivers, however, leading to revenue shortfalls at Sanral and underspending on maintenance. End-user pricing models clearly work better for railways (such as Gautrain) than roads.
South Africa's energy scene in 2019-23 will be characterised by a gradual decline in the dominant role of debt-laden Eskom, brisk growth in renewables (led by the private sector), and slow growth in electricity demand (because of sluggish economic growth and improvements in energy efficiency). The government's flagship renewable procurement programme, launched in 2011, has attracted investment of about US$14bn to date, mainly in solar and wind, which cut Eskom's share of the power mix from 95.9% in 2012 to 90.3% in 2018. The programme stalled in 2016 (partly because of Eskom's resistance), leaving several projects in limbo, but was revived by Mr Ramaphosa in 2018, leading the energy department to conclude new contracts worth US$4.7bn (for projects initially approved in 2014-15). Further bidding rounds are planned. The forecast period will see Eskom unbundled into separate distribution, transmission and generation arms, accompanied by the possible injection of private capital, provided trade union resistance can be overcome.
The draft update in 2018 to South Africa's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which runs to 2030, confirms the commitment to renewables but makes no provision for additional nuclear power. Eskom's coal-fired plants will continue to supply the bulk of base-load power, although the phased opening of new and hugely costly mega-plants at Medupi and Kusile (in 2017-23) will be see the closure of some ageing and less-efficient facilities. The final IRP update is still awaited, highlighting the political sensitivities surrounding energy policy. The risk of power shortages, which re-emerged in early 2019, will dissipate, but rising tariffs will burden end-users, while also driving energy efficiency.

South Africa's ICT sector is a leader in Africa
South Africa's information and computer technology (ICT) market is among the most advanced in Africa in terms of technology and service provision, highlighted by the opening of two cloud-computing centres by Microsoft (in Johannesburg and Cape Town) in March 2019, the first by any operator on the continent. Local data centres will reduce problems with latency (delays) and provide new options for firms, such as banks, which are obliged to hold data locally for privacy reasons. Amazon, the world's leading cloud-computing firm, is investing in new projects in Cape Town (where the firm's local HQ is located) focussing on cloud computing, machine learning and data analysis, ahead of the planned opening of its first local data centre in 2020. China's Huawei also plans a local data centre, and Google may follow after it lays a proprietary high-speed cable from Portugal to South Africa in 2021. Cape Town is emerging as a key ICT hub, helped by having one of Africa's largest public fibre-optic networks. Key challenges are relatively high end-user charges (although these are falling over time), an increase in cybercrimes-marked by a number of serious data breaches in the private sector-and skills shortages.
Spectrum allocation faces delay
The allocation of new spectrum (freed by the switch from analogue to digital) could give a major boost to ICT capacity, including the roll-out of 5G, but a delay seems likely, based on draft plans in July. These call for 20% of the new spectrum to be allocated to a wholesale open-access network (WOAN)-to benefit small players-with the rest being auctioned. However, a WOAN could take up to two years to implement, thereby delaying the spectrum boost, unless the plans are amended. South Africa's 5G roll-out could also be hampered by the US clampdown on Huawei-a market leader in network equipment-as part of the ongoing US-China trade war.
In a significant boost to ICT and science, South Africa will host the majority portion of the US$2bn Square Kilometre Array (SKA) complex, a powerful radio telescope in Northern Cape. The first portion of the SKA, a 64-dish radio telescope, known as MeerKAT, opened in July 2018 to scientific acclaim, following investment of US$332m, mainly from public sources, including from international partners in the SKA consortium. MeerKAT is also at the cutting edge of high-performance data processing, which bodes well for technological progress and digital skills building. MeerKAT will be the central component of the SKA, which will include additional dishes and arrays in South Africa and several other African countries. Parts of the SKA will also be situated in Australia, bringing the total number of dishes to about 3,000. MeerKAT will operate independently until it is linked to the SKA in 2023, although the entire project may not be finished until later in the decade. The SKA could offer clues to black holes, dark energy and the origin of the universe.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Boosting economic growth and job creation amid global uncertainty, while avoiding macroeconomic imbalances, will remain the main task facing policymakers. There is little scope for fiscal stimulus in view of the high costs of bailing out dysfunctional parastatals and the need to raise taxes in order to keep debt under control and forestall additional credit downgrades. The main medium-term challenge is to overcome structural obstacles to faster growth, such as infrastructure bottlenecks and skills shortages. Targeted industrial incentives will therefore stay in place, and infrastructure investment will remain a priority, despite being constrained by funding shortfalls. Other challenges include persistent labour market rigidities and the progressively stricter application of rules against anti-competitive behaviour.
The May 2019 election win for the ANC will add impetus to Mr Ramaphosa's agenda, although internal party dynamics will continue to impose constraints, especially with regard to labour law, parastatal reform and privatisation. Prospective wins for Mr Ramaphosa include restarting the private sector-led renewable energy programme and producing a more business-friendly mining charter. Opportunities for public-private partnerships will arise, including in the power sector. Land rights will remain subject to uncertainty, however, given the ANC's backing for expropriation without compensation in some circumstances. Corporates face the additional challenge of complying with black economic empowerment targets, exacerbated by ongoing changes to the legal framework. A plan published by the Treasury in August recommends several growth-boosting reforms (such as relaxing visa rules), but vested interests, including organised labour, are an obstacle. Many policy conundrums facing the government stem from the difficulty in reconciling the imperatives of growth with those of socioeconomic transformation.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Government expenditure 30.6 30.3 30.3 30.3 30.5 30.3
Government revenue 25.8 25.5 25.5 26.3 26.8 27.1
Budget balance -4.7 -4.8 -4.8 -4.0 -3.7 -3.2
The fiscal outlook is deteriorating, largely because of unbudgeted bail-out funding of R59bn (US$4.1bn) in July for Eskom-the struggling, heavily indebted power parastatal-including R26bn in fiscal-year 2019/20 (April-March) and R33bn in 2020/21. Combined with constraints on revenue stemming from slack GDP growth, restructuring of the tax agency and the demands of other weak parastatals, the government will struggle to meet is budget deficit targets, set in February, of 4.5% of GDP in 2019/20 and 4.3% of GDP in 2020/21. Adding in the bail-out funds while leaving other parameters unchanged would produce deficits of 4.9% of GDP in both years. The government's target of a deficit reduction to 4% of GDP in 2021/22 is also at risk. Fiscal consolidation will therefore advance more slowly than envisaged in the 2019/20 budget, with The Economist Intelligence Unit's budget deficit forecasts (as a proportion of GDP) rising to 4.8% in 2019/20 (up from 4.2%) and 4.8% in 2020/21 (up from 3.9%). Our subsequent projections are unchanged, with the deficit falling to 3.2% of GDP by 2023/24 as economic growth picks up. Larger deficits imply higher public debt (and debt-servicing costs) although most borrowing will be sourced from local markets, which limits exchange-rate risks.
The impact of the Eskom bailouts (and other post-budget developments) on the fiscal accounts will become clearer with the release of the medium-term budget policy statement in October. A significant upward adjustment in the projected deficits (and borrowing requirements) could imperil South Africa's remaining investment-grade rating. A revision of South Africa's outlook by Moody's in November (from stable to negative) could presage a full downgrade in 2020, thereby pushing up borrowing costs across the economy. A downgrade may be avoided, however, if fiscal and growth indicators improve.

Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 10.1 10.0 9.8 9.8 10.0 10.3
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% in July, reversing a rise of the same magnitude in November 2018. The rate cut primarily stems from moderate inflation, which has stayed close to 4.5%-the midway point of the SARB's 3-6% target range-since December. Inflation at current levels also meets the informal target set by the SARB governor, Lesetja Kganyago, who was reappointed for a second, five-year term in July, heralding policy continuity. The start of an easing cycle in the US with a rate cut by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) in late July, after the SARB acted, could lead to another domestic rate reduction later in 2019 or early 2020, depending on inflation and exchange-rate trends. Barring shocks, we expect South African rates to move within a fairly narrow range in 2019-23. The SARB will retain its inflation-targeting mandate and its independence, even if the government takes the institution into public ownership.

Domestic and global headwinds inform our GDP growth forecast of 0.8% in 2019, unchanged from 2018. Growth picked up mildly in the second quarter, to 0.9% year on year, from zero in the first quarter-when the economy suffered from widespread power cuts-but it remains sluggish, amounting to 0.4% in the first half. Agriculture, mining and construction all shrank in January-June, respectively because of poor rainfall, strikes and power cuts, and weak investment, although services kept the economy afloat, led by transport and financial services. On the demand side, consumption growth quickened in the second quarter and investment growth turned positive, but net exports made a negative contribution.
The rebound, albeit mild, will continue in the second half, barring fresh power cuts, helped by a pick-up in private-sector credit extension to households, and to a lesser extent, corporates. Recovery will be constrained, however, by a double-digit rise in power tariffs in 2019 and higher unemployment, which climbed to a near-record rate of 29% in the second quarter, thereby denting aggregate demand. The government's tight finances leave little room for fiscal stimulus, although another small interest-rate cut is possible, following a reduction in July, which will support demand and credit uptake.
Economic activity will benefit from the re-election of Mr Ramaphosa in May, which gives him a mandate to implement policy reforms geared towards job creation and investment. This will potentially buoy private-sector confidence, although investors will remain cautious because of policy divisions within the ruling ANC over several key issues, such as land reform and the overhaul of Eskom, which need further clarification. Global developments will remain a key variable in 2019 because of threats posed by US-led protectionism, trade wars and the UK's potentially disruptive departure from the EU.
Assuming that reforms gather momentum (instead of stalling)-and that global tensions dissipate rather than escalate-real GDP growth will quicken to 1.6% in 2020, before heading higher, to 3% a year on average in 2021-23. Action to overhaul dysfunctional parastatals will facilitate investment from both public and private sources, although resistance to change from trade unions and vested interests will impede progress. More buoyant consumption, underpinned by an expanding black middle class, will also drive the economy, as will the spread of digital technologies, but growth will be too slow to have a significant impact on unemployment. Structural constraints, such as skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks, will persist. A negative external balance will weigh on economic growth throughout most of the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side, services will remain the largest sector (69.7% of factor-cost GDP in 2018) and will continue to be a key growth source. Activity will remain subdued in 2019, in line with the wider economy, before gaining momentum in 2020-23, to grow by 2.4% a year. The large banking segment (22.4% of GDP, including real estate and business services) will remain a leading segment and a key source of job creation, bolstered by rising rates of financial inclusion. Growth in retailing and wholesaling (15.1% of GDP) will be sluggish in 2019, held back by wholesale-and the impact of high unemployment on aggregate demand-but will benefit from a July rate cut and faster credit growth to households. Medium-term prospects are favourable, spurred by urbanisation. Transport and communications (9.6% of GDP) will gain from new investment in infrastructure, including in railways, ports and fibre-optic cable networks. The mobile-phone market is largely saturated, with a penetration rate of about 155 subscriptions per 100 people in 2018, but a transition to high-end services and increased data usage will underpin expansion. Tourism has considerable potential-based on South Africa's varied natural attractions and favourable climate-and is also labour-intensive, although high crime levels remain a deterrent. Tourism will benefit from the ongoing relaxation of tighter visa restrictions, misguidedly imposed in 2014-15, which led to a temporary downturn.
Industry (27.7% of factor-cost GDP in 2018, including mining) is struggling, held back by weak construction, utilities and mining, but is poised to regain ground in 2020-23, to remain a key part of the economy. Manufacturing (13.5% of GDP) is broad-based by Sub-Saharan African standards, being a key employer and source of exports, although growth will remain fairly sluggish, given subdued domestic demand and competition from imports. The key vehicle segment will benefit from new investment, spurred by incentives offered under the Automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), which has now been extended beyond 2020, as part of the government's activist industrial policy. The risk of power shortages will persist, especially in the short term, owing to Eskom's financial and technical woes, but will diminish over time as new capacity, both private and public, comes onstream. Manufacturing will continue to face an elevated risk of strikes.
Mining makes a modest and declining contribution to GDP (8.1% in 2018), but accounts, directly and indirectly, for about 50% of export earnings. This leaves South Africa vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and to a slowdown in China. Mining also suffers from labour militancy and a high-level of regulatory uncertainty, leading to a paucity of new investment. A reworked mining charter is more business-friendly, but some aspects still require clarification. Despite South Africa's rich mineral reserves, faster growth will require a more conducive policy environment. The small agricultural sector (2.6% of GDP in 2018) is vulnerable to drought, but it will continue to make an important contribution to exports (including fruit and wine), agro-industry and employment. However, erratic rainfall poses a high degree of risk: agriculture contracted in 2015, 2016 and 2018 because of drought, interspersed by a strong rebound in 2017. Future performance is dependent on both the climate and the government's land-reform policies, which remain in flux.

Unit labour costs (US$) 5.0 -2.8 -0.9 2.0 -1.3 -0.2
Our inflation projection for 2019 stays at 4.6%, helped by softer oil prices. Rand depreciation and a double-digit increase in electricity tariffs will be the main inflationary drivers in 2019, along with tax rises. Dry weather poses some risk to food prices, but the main maize harvest should be sufficient to avoid imports. Lower global oil prices in 2019 (on an annual basis) will mute inflation, as will slack demand and spare industrial capacity. An oil price spike, although not our central forecast, would threaten the forecast, especially in conjunction with rand weakness. We expect inflation to average 4.9% a year in 2020-23, staying within the SARB's 3-6% target range (temporary breaches aside). Oil prices will rise in 2021-23, but prudent monetary policy, stricter competition laws and efficiency gains will help to mute price growth.

Purchasing power parity R:US$ (av) 6.17 6.45 6.65 6.90 7.15 7.40
The rand depreciated to R15.16:US$1 in August (from R14.04:US$1 in July), the weakest monthly rate-and the sharpest monthly decline-for more than three years. A US rate cut in late-July, which reversed a tightening trend, was potentially positive for the rand and other emerging-market currencies, but the impact has been overshadowed by growing concerns about escalating US-China trade wars and the consequent threat to the global economy. Domestic developments are adding to the pressure on the rand, especially sluggish GDP growth and the dire financial straits of Eskom, which threaten both the fiscal accounts and South Africa's remaining investment-grade credit rating. A downgrade, possibly in 2020, would have a negative impact on the value of the rand, but it may be avoided, depending on interim fiscal and macroeconomic developments. The rand will remain highly volatile, underlining its widely-traded status, although South Africa's modest level of external debt (denominated in foreign currency), offers some protection. We expect the rand to make a mild recovery from August levels, thereby leaving our forecasts are unchanged, at R14.48:US$1 in 2019 and R15.50:US$1 in 2020. The pace of depreciation will ease thereafter, helped by an improvement in several economic variables, taking the exchange rate to R17.80:US$1 in 2023.

The current-account deficit will fluctuate within a narrow range of 4-4.5% of GDP in 2019-22, before dropping to 3.7% of GDP in 2023. The structure of the deficit, comprising a merchandise trade surplus and a larger invisible trade deficit (on services, income and current transfers) will remain unchanged. Exports will grow at a modest pace in 2019-20, in line with non-oil commodity price trends and South Africa's heavy reliance on mineral sales. Non-mineral exports (such as cars) will benefit from a weaker rand and from South Africa's probable retention of trade preferences under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act, although US-led protectionism poses risks. Imports will be constrained by a slow pick-up in GDP growth and lower oil prices in 2019-20, keeping the merchandise trade balance in surplus. However, the shortfall on invisible trade will show a broad rising trend, underpinned by income payments to foreign investors and transfers to fellow members of the Southern African Customs Union. The current-account deficit will peak in 2020, at 4.5% of GDP, as world trade growth slows, before retreating slightly to an annual average of 4% of GDP in 2021-23, helped by stronger earnings.t

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in South Africa
Stocks and flows
South Africa is a prime destination for non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inflows averaged US$4bn a year in 2013-17, before rising to a four-year high of US$5.5bn in 2018, according to central bank figures, returning South Africa to top spot in the Sub-Saharan Africa investment league. Annual figures can vary substantially, however, because of the discontinuous nature of FDI, as well as the sensitivity of investment to commodity price trends (especially in mining) and changes in the policy environment. Inflows peaked at a record of US$9.9bn in 2008, boosted by the US$5.2bn purchase of a 20% stake in Standard Bank by China's state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)-the second-biggest FDI deal to date-behind the acquisition of 56% of ABSA by Barclays (UK) in 2005. Eight years later, in 2013, Barclays brought together most of its African operations, including ABSA, under the Barclays Africa banner, before subsequently announcing its withdrawal from Africa in 2016 as part of a global restructuring exercise. The sale of Barclays' majority stake in Barclays Africa, primarily to local investors, was completed in 2017. FDI regained momentum after the 2009 recession, rising to US$4.6bn in 2012, buoyed by the purchase by Walmart (US) of 51% of Massmart, for US$2.4bn. Inflows climbed higher, to US$8.2bn in 2013, the second highest on record, and remained strong at US$5.8bn in 2014, but weaker inflows in 2015 (US$1.5bn), 2016 (US$2.2bn) and 2017 (US$2.1bn) illustrate heightened investor concerns about domestic and global prospects. The rebound in 2018 suggests a recovery in confidence. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI to be fairly buoyant during the forecast period, averaging US$6.3bn a year in 2019-23 (and rising towards the end of the period), helped in part by South Africa's status as a gateway to Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa is also a major outward investor, especially in Africa, where local firms are present in a wide range of sectors, including services and infrastructure, as well as in more traditional natural resource exploitation. Outward FDI averaged US$6.3bn annually in 2013-17, surpassing inward FDI in all four years, but higher inflows and lower outflows in 2018 reversed the pattern.
Origin and distribution
Most major investors are represented in South Africa, including the UK (Vodafone and, formerly, Barclays), Germany (Mercedes-Benz and BMW) and the US (Coca-Cola, Ford and Walmart). Pepsi may join the list after launching a US$1.7bn takeover bid for Pioneer, a local consumer goods firm, in July 2019. Investment from non-traditional sources, especially China (ICBC) and India (Tata and Cipla), is growing strongly. Financial services, information and computer technology (ICT), tourism, real estate, mining, and manufacturing are among the most attractive sectors, helped in some cases by investment incentives (such as for vehicles). FDI in South Africa includes greenfield projects-in motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, food-processing, ICT and beverages-and buy-outs of existing firms (such as Massmart). The economically powerful Gauteng province receives the bulk of inward FDI, Eastern Cape benefits from investment in the Coega industrial zone and Western Cape is the main ICT hub. KwaZulu-Natal and North West respectively gain from investment in transport and mining, while Northern Cape is hosting the Square Kilometre Array telescope. New special economic zones will facilitate a more even spatial distribution of investment.
Determinants
Several factors drive inward investment, including South Africa's status as the most advanced economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (with close links to several other regional markets), a sizeable domestic market of 58.8m people (in mid-2019), strong tourism potential and world-class mineral wealth. South Africa's preferential access to the EU market, via a new economic partnership agreement concluded in 2014, and to the US market, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years, to 2025, also helps to support investment. Set against these factors are a number of deterrents, including a high degree of policy uncertainty, labour-market rigidity (and strikes), skills shortages, widespread crime and the dominant position of parastatals in several sectors. Contentious policy areas include a new FDI law that limits recourse to international arbitration, as well as proposals to allow for expropriation without compensation, which could damage property rights. Privatisation prospects are limited, although openings will arise for independent operators and public-private partnerships, mainly in energy and transport.
Impact
FDI has a strong positive impact in South Africa, especially in key sectors such as automotives, ICT, banking and mining, and has played a key role in boosting exports, facilitating growth and lifting employment. FDI provides capital, allows for the transfer of technology and skills, and binds South Africa more closely to the global economy.
Potential
We expect inflows to rise steadily during the forecast period, from US$5.5bn in 2018 to US$7.4bn in 2023, helped by a pick-up in local growth, but global and domestic risks are significant. The impact of the US-China trade war on global trade and growth, a slowdown in China, and a disorderly Brexit all have the potential to impede investment flows. Policy uncertainty will also inhibit investment, although the government's commitment to reforms is buoying confidence, despite periodic setbacks. Inflows will benefit from South Africa's activist industrial policy, especially in the automotive segment, and from private-sector investment in renewable energy. The retention of South Africa's AGOA status will also facilitate inflows (barring fresh disputes with the US over South Africa's eligibility), as will closer regional integration within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and between the SADC and other African trade blocs. A new Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) will give an additional boost if negotiations are conclusive. The rollout of a domestic cable network and the pending allocation of new spectrum will increase bandwidth and cut costs, facilitating investment in ICT, including in cloud computing and data analysis. Business-process outsourcing (given an English-speaking workforce in a similar time zone to the EU) has potential, but is underdeveloped. South Africa will remain a key base for companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

South Africa's population is projected to grow at a relatively modest rate of 1.2% per year in 2019-23, partly because of the ongoing impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the population to rise from an estimated 57.8m in 2018, to 61.5m in 2023, including positive net migration, mainly from neighbouring states. The latest official estimates for mid-2019 show that almost 8m people are living with HIV/AIDS-more than in any other country, and equivalent to 13.5% of the population. The number of victims and the prevalence rate therefore continues to rise; however, on other key metrics, such as deaths attributable to AIDS and the incidence rate of new infections, South Africa is making significant progress. AIDS-related deaths fell to 126,805 (23.4% of all fatalities) in the year to mid-2019-the lowest since the series began in 2002-from a peak of 286,588 in 2006, helped by the mass roll-out of anti-retroviral drugs. Most of those in need now receive treatment, enabling them to live longer and more productive lives, although the costs are substantial, amounting to about US$2bn a year. South Africa's incidence rate has also fallen sharply, from a peak of 2.5% in 2002 to just 0.7% in 2018 and 2019. With the incidence rate having fallen below the critical 1% mark, the prevalence rate is now increasing more slowly than the overall population growth rate and will start to decline during the forecast period.
The disease will remain a significant source of mortality into the medium term, imposing costs at the household, corporate and national levels. The loss of trained workers, either through death or extended absenteeism, is particularly damaging in a country so short of skills. Organisations therefore need to adopt coping strategies, such as increased expenditure on training. Despite positive data trends, any complacency with regards to AIDS is misplaced; instead, the government, in partnership with the private sector, should consider fresh policy initiatives.
Life expectancy will rise steadily
The fall in AIDS-related deaths is being accompanied by a rise in average life expectancy, which reached 64.7 years in mid-2019, up from a recent low of just 54.4 years in 2005. The improvement moves South Africa closer to the average for upper-middle-income countries, and further gains can be expected during the forecast period. South African demographic statistics, including age profiles, growth rates and life expectancy also display large race-based variations stemming from the apartheid era. The white population-typically wealthier, older and more educated-declined by 0.4%, to 4.7m, in the year to mid-2019 (7.9% of the total), thereby maintaining a long-term downward trend, driven by outward migration. By contrast, in the year to mid-2019, the Indian/Asian population grew by 1.5%, to 1.5m (2.6% of the total), the coloured/mixed-race population by 1.2%, to 5.2m (8.8% of the total), and the black population by 1.7%, to 47.4m (80.7% of the total). The black share of the total population will continue rising over time, based on current trends.
National Health Insurance advances
Healthcare, which is marked by costly private-sector provision for the rich and second-rate public provision for the poor majority, will face a shake-up over the next decade because of the government's decision to implement a National Health Insurance (NHI) system after lengthy delays. An NHI bill in July 2019 outlines the new framework, based on the centralised procurement of services from both public and private providers, but many key details have still to be settled, including funding and the precise role of private sector. Reforms are clearly needed, given a steady rise in overall healthcare costs to about 9% of GDP (of which half is accounted for by private operators), but whether the NHI will have an adverse or beneficial outcome depends on a host of uncertainties. Risks include damaging private healthcare and putting more pressure on overstretched public facilities and the fiscal accounts. The target date for full NHI implementation is 2026, beyond the forecast period, and additional delays are probable.
Rapid urbanisation will strain social services
South Africa is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's most urbanised societies, with an estimated 66.4% of the population living in urban centres in 2018, principally in the main metropolitan areas of Gauteng, namely Pretoria and Johannesburg, and the coastal cities of Cape Town and Durban. Urbanisation will continue throughout the forecast period, lifting the proportion living in cities (and associated slums) to 69.1% by 2023. Urbanisation is boosting market potential but also poses challenges for policymakers, in terms of strengthening service delivery at a municipal level.

South Africa's consumer market will continue transforming as the poor black majority is increasingly drawn into the mainstream economy, accompanied by an expansion of the black middle class. The transition is happening less rapidly than previously expected, given several years of sluggish growth and high unemployment (which constrains aggregate demand). Transformation will gain momentum during the forecast period, helped by faster growth and government initiatives to address poverty and inequality, such as generous welfare payments, black economic empowerment (BEE) and a national minimum wage. Despite significant changes since the apartheid era, South Africa remains one of the world's most unequal societies-with a Gini co-efficient of 0.63 (on a scale of 0-1; the higher the number, the higher the level of income inequality)-largely because of persistent racial disparities. Spending by black households is rising much faster than for white households in real terms, but the absolute gap remains large. We expect policy actions, demographic changes and faster growth to erode race-based distinctions over time as more blacks enter the middle class, which currently accounts for about 35% of households.
Consumer spending will show a broad upward trend
Household spending growth in real terms retreated from 4.2% a year in 2010-12, when the economy rebounded from the 2009 recession, to just 1.5% a year in 2013-18, reflecting an overall growth slowdown, weak job creation, rising interest rates (in 2014-16), household indebtedness and wages lost to strikes. Spending growth sank to just 0.6% in 2016, owing to a severe drought, but recovered to 2.1% in 2017, helped by better rains and a first rate cut in five years. An ebb to 1.8% in 2018 partly stemmed from higher taxes. Spending growth will remain muted in 2019, but is poised to quicken, underpinned by a July rate cut and a pick-up in credit allocation to households, which grew by a multi-year high of 6.5% year on year in June. Moreover, household debt (as a proportion of disposable income) is on downward trend, falling to 72% in 2018. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a steady rise in household consumption during the forecast period, in line with wider economic expansion. More generous welfare payments, rising real wages (for those in work), higher levels of financial inclusion and the expansion of the black middle class will support the improving trend.
Consumer spending will also benefit from the expansion of low-cost housing and electrification-boosting demand for ancillary goods and services-and from a broader-based approach to BEE. The benefits of BEE have been spread narrowly to date, helping to create a new black elite (the so-called black diamonds, who generally display similar consumption patterns to rich whites). However, the drive towards more broad-based BEE, including employee share-ownership schemes and a focus on suppliers, will potentially spread the gains more widely, boosting both the black middle class and poorer market segments.
The introduction of a national minimum wage on January 1st 2019 may buoy market potential but also carries risks, in terms of weaker job creation. The overall impact may be small, however, as the minimum wage is set fairly low and some exemptions apply. "Demonstration effect" purchasing by new middle-class entrants and blue-collar workers-and easier access to and greater reliance on credit-will buoy markets for more expensive retail goods such as electrical appliances. The spread of modern shopping malls will reinforce the trend, as will competition between the leading retailers, Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Woolworths and Massmart, the latter of which Walmart (US) took a majority stake in 2012 for US$2.4bn.

Consumer expenditure will show a broad upward trend over the forecast period, in both rand and US-dollar terms, although the composition of consumption will not change radically. In line with conventional patterns, the proportion spent on foodstuffs will decline over time, although it will remain the largest single category of expenditure, underpinned by the entry of subsistence-level rural dwellers into the commercial economy and the rise in the spending power of lower-income groups (which typically spend more of their money on food).

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Growth will revive gradually in 2019-23, helped by a rise in confidence under Cyril Ramaphosa's presidency, accompanied by greater policy clarity and a crackdown on corruption, which will encourage investment. However, global headwinds (including trade wars) and fiscal consolidation in South Africa, alongside lingering policy uncertainty-especially about land reform-mean that growth, despite quickening, will remain sluggish, averaging 2.3% a year in 2019-23. Lower interest rates will provide a mild stimulus, although monetary policy will remain strongly determined by global trends. Growth will therefore be too slow to make a significant dent in the high unemployment rate (currently 29%), which continues to dampen aggregate demand. Structural constraints such as labour market rigidity and skills shortages will persist, although electricity supplies will improve, helped by private-sector investment in renewable energy.
The impact of HIV/AIDS will gradually dissipate in 2031-50
Demographic trends: South Africa's population will continue to grow at a slow pace, held back by the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which may persist for another generation. However, the downward trend in new infections and deaths attributable to AIDS, and the ongoing rollout of treatment programmes, will reduce the impact of the disease in 2031-50. Life expectancy will consequently rise, although population growth will remain relatively muted, as rising disposable incomes and urbanisation lead to smaller families. The working-age population and the labour force will grow slightly faster than the overall population, given the high proportion of young people and inward migration from other African states, adding to the difficulty of bringing down the unemployment rate. Demographic trends also point to a rise in the proportion of urban dwellers, from 66.4% in 2018 to 80% in 2050.
External conditions: South Africa's performance, as a relatively small and open economy that is strongly reliant on mineral exports, will remain closely tied to world trends. This leaves South Africa vulnerable to disruptions stemming from US-led protectionism (under the presidency of Donald Trump), Brexit and a Chinese slowdown. Multilateral trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation may fall victim to trade wars, although trade will benefit from bilateral and regional initiatives, including plans for a single African market. The Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) was formally launched in July 2019, but will require lengthy negotiations before coming into effect. The Southern African Development Community will continue pressing for freer trade, although ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union may not be realised until after 2030, because of economic and policy divergences between members. Intra-African trade will be held back by non-tariff barriers and weak infrastructure in 2015-30, but these constraints will ease in 2031-50. Ties with the EU will continue to deepen, following agreement on a new economic partnership agreement in 2014. South Africa will retain preferential access to the US market-given the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act until 2025-although its eligibility will be subject to periodic reviews. Trade and investment ties with non-OECD states, especially fellow BRICS members (Brazil, Russia, India and China) will deepen over the long term, at the expense of traditional links with OECD partners.
The quality of institutions will improve
Institutions and policy trends: The quality of institutions will improve, boosting transparency and accountability, but capacity constraints will persist, especially at provincial and municipal levels. Key institutions, such as the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) and the judiciary, will retain their independence, even if the former moves into public ownership. The wider policy framework-which is based on a partnership between private business and the "developmental state"-will remain intact. In broad terms, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects moderate, centrist voices to prevail in the policy debate in the longer term, at the expense of pro-patronage forces and the interventionist left. The process will be helped by political realignments that could see the fragmentation of the ruling tripartite alliance-comprising the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party-and the emergence of a new coalition between moderates in the ANC and the opposition. Challenges such as skills shortages, high unemployment and land reform will persist, although investment will alleviate infrastructure constraints.
Productivity gains will boost growth in the longer term
Long-term performance: We forecast that real GDP growth will average 4% a year in 2019-50, helped by rising life expectancy, improved healthcare, investment in infrastructure, regional integration and global demand for commodities. Technological advances, such as cloud computing and additive printing, will also drive growth and boost productivity. Growth will quicken to 4.3% a year in 2031-50 as the ICT revolution gathers momentum and African integration deepens. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period, owing to a combination of skills shortages and investment in new technology.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
The threat of climate change continues to rise up the national agenda, driven by water deficits, which could worsen as weather patterns become more extreme. A three-season drought in Western Cape, after the failure of winter rains in 2015-17, leading to strict water rationing, highlights the challenge, although rainfall was better in 2018-19. The government is developing a comprehensive climate change policy, in the form of a draft National Climate Change Bill, unveiled in mid-2018, and is also a signatory to the Paris Agreement (2015), which aims to secure cuts in greenhouse gas emissions on a global basis. The introduction of a carbon tax in July 2019 is a key step, but faces criticism from the green lobby for being too low, and from business for being too high, thereby threatening competitiveness. The carbon tax's impact will be fairly small in the first phase, in 2019-22, given a raft of exemptions and concessions, although rules will become tighter in 2023-30, depending on the outcome of a proposed first-phase review. The carbon tax poses some inevitable challenges but will also encourage innovation. The government's long-term energy plan, running to 2030 and close to being finalised, will have a major impact on emissions, because of increased reliance on renewable energy at the expense of coal-fired power. Coal's share of installed generating capacity is expected to fall to 45% in 2030, down from 72% in 2018. Major reforms in water policy and management are also required, to stem the risk of ever more severe droughts.
Technological developments
South Africa, with the most advanced information and computer technology (ICT) environment in Africa, is well-placed to benefit from future technological progress. The continent's first cloud-computing data centres, under the Microsoft banner, opened in March 2019 in Johannesburg and Cape Town-the two domestic ICT hubs-and Amazon is similarly investing in cloud computing and advanced data processing. In terms of start-up numbers and financing, South Africa leads the pack in Africa, according to the GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide. This reflects the dynamic business environment, especially by African standards, as well as South Africa's reputable legal system, strong banks and adequate power supplies. Skills shortages will nonetheless remain a challenge, although the probable loosening of restrictions on inward migration for skilled workers may address some of the deficit. Other obstacles include comparatively high end-user tariffs (although these will trend downwards) and the global problem of cybercrime and data security.
South Africa's central role in the multi-national Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a powerful radio telescope, will make a significant contribution to technological progress. SKA's first portion opened in July 2018 to scientific acclaim, and will be followed by new arrays in South Africa, other African countries and Australia over the next decade, at a total cost of at least US$2bn. SKA's high-performance data-processing requirements will help to drive technological development. The roll-out of 5G will benefit from the allocation of new spectrum, although this may be delayed until 2021 because of plans to hand 20% to an open-access network. South Africa will also benefit from space-based technology (helped by ongoing satellite launches) and the local development of 3D-printing using platinum. Digital innovation has the potential to transform almost all economic sectors.
Migration and urbanisation
South Africa is a net recipient of cross-border migration, unlike most African countries, driven by inflows from poorer parts of the continent, which will continue into the long term. The latest mid-year estimates for 2019 show that net inward migration accounted for about 24% of the total population increase (of 836,000) during the preceding 12 months. From another perspective, inward migration was responsible for 0.3 of a percentage point of the overall 1.4% annual increase. This replicates the broad pattern over the past decade, although the relative contribution of net inward migration will ease over time because of faster economic growth in other African states than in South Africa and a rise in South Africa's natural population growth rate as the impact of HIV/AIDS diminishes.
South Africa's white population (4.7m in 2019; 7.9% of the total) continues to shrink (by 20,000 in the year to mid-2019, a multi-year high) because of outward migration, leading to a loss of skills. However, migrant inflows are far larger and will also make a positive skills contribution, helped, for example, by Zimbabwe having better schools than South Africa. Inward migration will continue to pose social challenges, given South Africa's high unemployment rate, leading to periodic bouts of xenophobia-tinged unrest. Net inward migration means that remittance outflows exceed remittance inflows, contrary to the African pattern. Internal migration within South Africa from poorer provinces to the economic hubs of Gauteng and Western Cape will also drive population movement and urbanisation, although the proliferation of informal settlements and deficits in service provision will remain pressing issues.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: A total of 19 EU members share the euro as their currency and are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. At its September 2019 meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a stimulus package that was more dovish than many had expected, sending a strong signal that ultra-loose monetary policy will persist in the medium term and at least into 2021.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars. The EU's creation dates back to the Rome Treaty of 1957, which created the European Economic Community between the six founding EU member states (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). After four enlargements in 1973 (UK, Denmark, Ireland), 1981 (Greece), 1986 (Spain and Portugal) and 1995 (Austria, Finland and Sweden), the EU counted 15 members. The collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU; UK-EU negotiations on the UK's exit from the EU have so far been difficult. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than those of other east European countries. The effects of war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-eastern Europe. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, many countries continue to have deep economic and political ties with Russia.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular, the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-notably those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at EU level. A total of 19 EU members share the euro as their currency and are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have sometimes been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform, and institutional change, vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster-and more successfully-with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with traditional mainstream parties will persist during the forecast period (2019-23), leading to greater success for populist and insurgent parties in elections; difficulties in government formation; and the creation of unusual (and in some cases unstable) coalitions.
The May 2019 European Parliament elections resulted in a more fragmented political landscape. The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) remain the two largest parliamentary groups, but they lost their majority for the first time.
The New European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has nominated her commissioners and put forward an ambitious policy agenda, but the geopolitical and policy divisions in the EU will stymie progress, including on budgets, foreign policy and security, migration and trade.
The UK remains in political deadlock over Brexit. The British parliament has rejected the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and a "no-deal" Brexit. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that a general election is the most likely way out of the current impasse. A no-deal Brexit remains a risk.
Economic policy
We expect the euro zone to resist steps towards full fiscal integration, but the Franco-German axis will drive forward some reforms in the coming years.
Some countries will continue to push back against EU and euro zone rules. However, a confrontation between the Italian government and the European Commission over the country's fiscal plans looks to have been averted following the departure of the Lega and the formation of a new coalition in August.
At its September 2019 meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a stimulus package that was more dovish than many had expected, sending a strong signal that ultra-loose monetary policy will persist in the medium term and at least into 2021.
Economic growth
The euro zone's economic recovery was broad-based and sustained in 2017, but growth slowed in 2018. This loss of momentum has carried through into 2019 and we expect a substantial slowdown in growth rates across the bloc this year and next, before growth picks up again from 2021.
The main reason for the slowdown is a deterioration of the external environment, with softer global trade and high geopolitical uncertainty, reflecting US-China trade tensions, the threat of a US tariff increase on EU automotive exports and the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the UK.
However, domestic demand has remained firm, with private consumption supported by widespread labour market improvements, and investment growth fuelled by high capacity-utilisation rates and favourable lending conditions.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries, as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace, and this will continue.

Political outlook: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period (2019-23). The negative political fallout from the global financial crisis and euro zone crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the traditional political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. The fragmentation of the political landscape is leading to delays in forming governments after elections and an increase in unstable coalition governments. The rise of populism has hampered reform efforts at both the national and regional levels, and a meaningful overhaul of the European institutional framework is unlikely.
Challenges for the EU include Brexit and migration
Threats to European political stability over the medium term include the damaging impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU; disagreement over how to manage migration policy and over the proper balance between national sovereignty and "pooled sovereignty"; and the impact of an economic growth slowdown on support for the mainstream political parties.
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a challenge for the bloc, and the departure of one of the EU's largest members will continue to reverberate after the UK leaves (in 2019 or 2020). The country's departure will leave a hole in the EU budget, which will be difficult to overcome without generating antagonism within the bloc. However, so far Brexit has resulted in increased European solidarity rather than tensions between member states. This is because leading member states such as France and Germany are keen to send a strong political message that a departure from the bloc will be more damaging for the exiting member state than for the EU.
In the wake of the European Parliament elections on May 23rd-26th, which resulted in a more fragmented parliament (compared with the 2014 Parliament elections), the process of appointing candidates to the top jobs was protracted. On July 2nd, EU heads of state announced their candidate choices, after reaching a compromise on Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister, as their nominee for president of the next European Commission. The package of nominations also included Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, as the president of the European Central Bank (ECB); Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, as president of the European Council; and Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign affairs minister, as high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The nominations bolster the political strength of the core EU member states and can be viewed as a win for Emmanuel Macron, the French president.
Ms von der Leyen formally presented her team of commissioners on September 10th. Confirmation hearings will be held in late October in the European Parliament, before the line-up (or a revised version, should any changes be required) is confirmed in office on November 1st. Ms von der Leyen stated the need to "address the changes in climate, technology and demography", and then presented three executive vice-president roles (out of eight vice-president positions in total) that correspond to these areas. We expect a hawkish stance on competition policy, energetic efforts to push for a carbon-neutral economy and some easy wins in social policy. Other policy areas-notably trade negotiations, budget discipline and migration-will be more controversial. Ms von der Leyen would like Europe to be seen as an alternative model to the US or China, emphasising multilateralism, fair trade and the rules-based order, rather than protectionism or authoritarianism. However, achieving her goals will depend on building consensus on difficult issues within a fragmented European Parliament.
The political scene in Germany will be less stable than in the recent past
Germany is a leading example of a country where support for the traditionally dominant mainstream parties has declined sharply as the landscape of voter support has become more fragmented. The government installed in Germany in March 2018 is another grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the Christian Social Union (CSU, its Bavarian sister party) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, the seat share of these two parties has declined from almost three-quarters of parliament in 2005 to 56% now. Parties that take a clear line on migration and openness have benefited most from this-notably the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now the largest opposition party, and the centre-left Greens, who stand for an open Germany.
The fall in support for the SPD has been particularly extreme. The party is approaching a leadership contest, which could result in calls from within the party to quit the grand coalition and re-establish itself in opposition. Nonetheless, we expect the government to serve its full term, as forcing a snap election would probably cost the SPD most of its parliamentary representation. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, will stand down at the end of her term in 2021, which will be a significant change after 16 years in office.
Germany has played an important role on the EU stage in recent years, and its economic dominance within the euro zone means that this will continue. The German position on questions of reform-a consensus against further fiscal transfers within the bloc, lukewarm support for euro zone reform, and stronger support for a redesign of security and refugee policy-are unlikely to change. Relations with Mr Macron will be important in the debate about the future of Europe.
In France political stability has returned, for now
In France Mr Macron enjoys the support of a solid majority of deputies in the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), which has enabled him to make substantial progress on his ambitious legislative agenda since taking office in May 2017. He came to power determined not to give in to the sort of street protests that had derailed so many of his predecessors' plans, and front-loaded difficult structural reform efforts in the hope that the results would materialise before the end of his term in 2022.
However, weekly protests by the "Gilets Jaunes" in late 2018 and early 2019 forced him to rethink his plans. These protests began in response to a proposed tax rise on fuel, but struck a chord more generally with people frustrated by stagnant wages, who view Mr Macron as the "president of the rich". In response, Mr Macron pledged EUR10bn in concessions to the protesters in December 2018 and held a national debate in January-March 2019. This resulted in a new package of reforms that will make up "Act II" of his presidency.
The debate was in part a way of calming the social unrest, and in part a way of reconnecting with voters who had grievances to express. More than 2m people took part, and the protests eased in intensity, with Mr Macron's approval ratings stabilising at about 30%. Although there has been no overall change in the government's policy direction, a range of new legislative measures has been announced, including an easing of the tax burden, a rise in pensions and a boost to public service provision. Mr Macron will continue to face vocal opposition, but the risks to political stability have fallen.
Political stability will improve in Spain, but the Catalan issue is still unresolved
In Spain politics has become increasingly unsettled in recent years. Parliamentary fragmentation, a litany of political graft scandals and rising regional nationalism in Catalonia pose serious challenges to governance. Against this backdrop, in April 2019 Spain held its third general election since December 2015. The snap vote was triggered by the rejection at the hands of two Catalan pro-independence parties of the 2019 budget proposal made by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government. The PSOE, led by Mr Sánchez, won a decisive victory at the election, raising its vote share from 22.6% in 2016 to nearly 29%. The nationalist, far-right Vox entered the national parliament for the first time after surging to 10.3% of the vote. Having failed to obtain the confidence of parliament to form a government in July, Mr Sánchez had until September 23rd to obtain sufficient support. Because he failed to do that, a repeat election will take place on November 10th 2019.
In September, after months of negotiations, the PSOE was unable to reach an agreement with the far-left Unidas Podemos (UP) on the framework of a left-wing government. The PSOE accepted only a common policy programme with UP, whereas UP remained intent on a coalition government. Both parties were unwilling to make further concessions, leaving a repeat general election scheduled for November 10th as the only remaining option to break the deadlock. Several opinion polls released in mid-September projected gains for the PSOE, but had the party falling at least 30 seats short of an absolute majority. The prospect of gaining more seats and freeing itself from a reliance on smaller parties-such as the separatists in Catalonia-could have been one incentive for the PSOE to face a fresh poll.
We expect that the election will again deliver a fragmented parliament, but to a slightly lesser degree than following the April election. We believe that the PSOE will still fall short of an absolute majority, but it will increase its representation in parliament and therefore negotiating power. The most likely scenario is a minority PSOE-led government with the external support of UP and the liberal Ciudadanos (Citizens). Such a government would probably have a simple majority in a second-round investiture vote. Two other possible scenarios are the PSOE reaching a coalition agreement with either the UP and the support of small regionalist parties (preferably without Catalan separatists), or with Ciudadanos. There is a risk that centre-right parties (especially the PP) perform better that expected in the polls, although we do not think the PP, Ciudadanos and the nationalist, far-right Vox will be able to obtain a majority of seats. We expect the Catalan issue to persist, with no clear solution in sight.
Brexit is likely to be delayed owing to a political deadlock in the UK
The UK is currently in a political deadlock over Brexit. Upon becoming prime minister on July 24th, Boris Johnson promised that the UK would leave the EU, with or without a deal, on the current Brexit deadline of October 31st. However, in September, opposition members of parliament (MPs) successfully passed the so-called Benn-Burt bill into law. This bill requires the prime minister to request an extension of Article 50 until January 31st, if no withdrawal agreement has passed by October 19th, and to accept within two days any counter-offer given by the EU, unless parliament explicitly overrules this. Some 21 Conservative MPs rebelled against the Conservative whip to support the bill, and were subsequently expelled from the Parliamentary Conservative Party. This expulsion, combined with additional defections, leaves the government 43 seats short of a majority. As the legal default option is now for the UK to request an extension and with Mr Johnson now far short of a majority needed to change this law, we believe that this is by far the most likely outcome
However, having lost its majority, the government is likely to fall once the imminent threat of no deal is postponed. The EU is also likely to insist on some material change, such as an election, as a justification for an extension. Therefore, it is likely that there will be an election in November or December. We expect that Mr Johnson will use parliament's role in blocking him as a rallying cry for an election-seeking a mandate to deliver Brexit on the new deadline, while the opposition parties will campaign on ways to further delay, soften or revoke the Brexit process. The outcome of the election is highly uncertain with current polling suggesting another hung parliament as a likely outcome, leaving both no deal and no Brexit as possible outcomes, as well as a potentially divisive second referendum.
The Italian government will be unstable and will not last long
The general election in Italy in 2018 produced a highly fragmented parliament. Following prolonged negotiations, the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 33% of the vote, and the Eurosceptic far-right Lega, which secured 17% agreed to form a coalition government. In early August 2019 Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, called a vote of no confidence in the Lega-M5S coalition, in the hope of forcing a general election to capitalise on the Lega's growing popularity. A shared desire to prevent the Lega from forming a hard-right government pushed the M5S and centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) to agree to form a new coalition together. This is still led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent.
We believe that the new Conte government is unlikely to last until the end of the parliamentary term in 2023, but it will hold together for 12-18 months. Much will depend on whether electoral support for the Lega remains high.
Turkey has completed its transition towards one-man rule
In Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected in June 2018 as president of Turkey for a second term in the first round of a snap election, while the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), in an election that was mostly free, but largely unfair.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system grants the president wide-ranging executive powers with little oversight (including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary) and has abolished the role of prime minister. This greatly curtails the role of parliament.
We expect the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in mid-2016, to remain in power until 2023. Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered a clear blow to their credibility when the opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, increased his margin of victory over Binali Yildirim of the ruling coalition in the Istanbul mayoral election rerun at the end of June 2019. However, Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on political dissent to maintain his dominance of Turkish politics in the coming years.
Terrorist attacks by Islamic State (IS) and the independence conflict being waged by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) pose a constant security risk. Neither the government nor the PKK is interested in reviving peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, raising the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels.
The transition to a post-Putin Russia has led to greater political jockeying
The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, won a comfortable victory in the March 2018 presidential election. Although Mr Putin's re-election itself was a non-event, given his high approval ratings and the absence of credible opposition candidates, it has ushered in a period of political uncertainty as various factions of the elite jockey to secure their positions in the post-Putin political order-assuming that the president stands down at the end of his term in 2024 (our core forecast). The transition will result in great uncertainty owing to the weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the personalised and opaque governance system around Mr Putin.
Mr Putin's fourth term will be characterised by broad continuity in his policy agenda, which focuses on "conservative cultural values", an authoritarian political culture and overt anti-Westernism. We also expect a renewed focus on domestic policy in an effort to arrest the current decline in living standards and bolster growth following the 2015-16 recession. Despite occasional pro-market rhetoric, economic policy will remain statist, nationalist and protectionist. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a priority.
On the international stage, Russia will continue to pursue a muscular foreign policy, with the aim of asserting its status as a major global player. Its influence will be strengthened by the conclusion of international deals in strategic sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear power plants and military equipment.
The CIS region will be mostly stable
We do not expect political or economic upheaval in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the near term. The exceptions to this are Uzbekistan, where the new president will continue to pursue a reformist course, and Armenia and Georgia, where street protests in 2018 led to a change in government, and where economic growth will outpace that of most other countries in the region. Kazakhstan will undergo a successful managed political transition, with Kasym-Jomart Tokayev (the chosen successor to Nursultan Nazarbayev) winning a landslide victory in the June 2019 presidential election. We believe that no significant political or economic change will take place in the other central Asian countries (the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan).
Political outlook: Election watch
General elections across Europe since 2017 have confirmed rising disaffection with the political establishment, which has been reflected in the decline of the two-party system and the rise of insurgent populist parties. Increasing political fragmentation across the region has resulted in a more complicated policymaking outlook, but has also made forming governments more difficult and given rise to some unusual coalitions.
The shift on migration under the ÖVP will help it into government
Austria provides one example. Following the expulsion in May 2019 of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), the then chancellor and leader of the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP), Sebastian Kurz, lost a vote of no confidence, supported by the Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the FPÖ. This led to the appointment of a placeholder government until elections are held on September 29th. We expect the ÖVP to emerge as the largest party from the election, after campaigning on a more hardline policy towards migration and integration. However, we do not expect the party to win enough support to govern alone, requiring another coalition. We expect the FPÖ to re-enter government as the ÖVP's coalition partner, owing to the considerable policy overlap between the two parties, although the position of controversial FPÖ politicians could impede any new coalition deal.
European Parliament elections result in a more fragmented EU political scene
The European Parliament elections, held on May 23rd-26th, reflected similar trends to those since 2017 at the national level. There were significant gains for the liberal, centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and for the Greens/European Free Alliance, alongside a continued rise in support for nationalist, populist and Eurosceptic parties (most notably the single-issue Brexit Party in the UK). The traditional mainstream parties struggled in comparison, with the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) losing their majority for the first time.
Nonetheless, the results from May 2019 do not pose a threat to the European project, as some had feared before the event. We expect the balance of power within the European Parliament to remain largely pro-EU-even more so once the UK leaves the bloc and its members of European Parliament (MEPs) stand down. We do not expect the hardline Eurosceptic parties, which are highly heterogeneous, to be able to form a cohesive, united front.
Recent Ukraine elections hinge on question of corruption
Another significant election in the third quarter of 2019 was the parliamentary election in Ukraine in July. In April Volodymyr Zelenskyi, a comedian and television celebrity with no political experience, won a decisive victory in a second-round vote against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko. This victory was the result of a widespread popular rejection of political elites in general and of Mr Poroshenko in particular, as well as a perception that the changes promised after the 2014 revolution had not materialised. Following the July parliamentary polls, Servant of the People, a new political party created to support the candidacy of Mr Zelenskyi in the presidential race, commands an absolute majority of seats in parliament. This has given Mr Zelenskyi has a strong mandate to tackle corruption and speed up an ambitious set of reforms that he laid out in the first weeks of his presidency. These include changes to the political system to ensure more accountability (which includes removing the immunity of the president and deputies), a new deal with the IMF and the revival of an anti-corruption campaign that stalled in the last months of Mr Poroshenko's presidency.
In Greece a snap general election was held on July 7th, three months before the end of the parliamentary term. The main centre-right opposition party, New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recorded a comfortable victory over the ruling Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza). The Syriza leader and prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called the election after losing heavily to ND in the European Parliament and local elections on May 26th. At the general election, ND obtained 39.85% of the national vote, which, along with a 50-seat bonus awarded to the party with the most votes, gave Mr Mitsotakis's party 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament. This makes his government the first single-party government since the start of the Greek crisis nearly a decade ago. Despite its solid majority, the new government faces formidable policy challenges, not least to implementing its programme of spending and tax cuts.
Fine Gael minority coalition government will not survive a full term
The Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland does not have the capacity or cohesion to address the mounting economic and political challenges in the country effectively, and our view remains that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021. We currently expect a snap election to take place in early 2020-although we do not expect this to produce a government any more stable or effective than the current coalition. This existing administration, led by Leo Varadkar, relies on the support of a disparate group of independent MPs, and a three-year "confidence and supply" agreement between Fine Gael and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. The agreement with Fianna Fail was extended in December, as neither Mr Varadkar nor Micheal Martin, the leader of Fianna Fail, was willing to trigger an early election while there was still great uncertainty regarding Brexit. However, opinion polls have recently shifted towards Fianna Fail, and we expect them to withdraw their support for the current government as soon as the threat of a no-deal Brexit in the UK is no longer imminent.

Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt rows between EU members has fallen sharply since 2016, in the context of an economic recovery across the bloc in 2016-18. The ECB has overcome objections in a number of countries-notably Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing (QE) has not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. There were fears that one or some euro zone countries might exit the bloc during the financial crisis. However, this scenario now seems unlikely, and the financial stability of the bloc looks strong despite the high public debt levels of some south European countries (such as Greece, which existed its bail-out programme in August 2018, and Italy).
Italian government is testing the limits of the EU's patience on fiscal rules
The trend toward "sovereigntist" and Eurosceptic politics has played out dra-matically over the past year. In Italy, the previous government, composed of the anti-establishment M5S and the anti-immigration Lega, tested the limits of EU rules, particularly on fiscal policy and immigration. Following a protracted dispute with the European Commission over its draft 2019 budget plan, the previous administration narrowly avoided the launch of an excessive-deficit procedure in early July.
We expect the new government coalition comprising the pro-European PD and the M5S to be less confrontational towards EU rules on migration and fiscal policy than the previous administration. It remains to be seen what Mr Conte can realistically achieve regarding his government's demands for a revision of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact in favour of economic growth-friendly policies, and a review of the Dublin Regulation to ensure burden-sharing among member states in dealing with migrants seeking asylum in the EU. The prospect of obtaining some concessions on the fiscal front appears to be better than the chance of concessions on the highly divisive migration issue.
Hungary and Poland will continue to clash with the EU over illiberal policies
The nationalist, socially conservative governments in Hungary and Poland have come into conflict with the EU over the EU's refugee-relocation policy and also over the creation of what the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has called-in reference to his own country-an "illiberal" state. In addition to refusing to take their allocation of refugees, the Hungarian and Polish govern-ments have curbed the independence of the judiciary, imposed government control over the public-service media and clamped down on civil-society groups. The Commission has referred several of these measures to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), but it has so far struggled to find an effective response. Steps taken by the Commission and the European Parliament since December 2017 to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, possibly resulting in the suspension of a member country's voting rights, are unlikely to succeed; they require the unanimous vote of all members, and Hungary and Poland have made clear that they would support one another in such an event.
Turkey's foreign policy with the EU and US will be increasingly confrontational
Turkey's relationships with the EU and the US have shifted under the AKP since the early 2000s. Declining trust in the US and the EU and an ambition to make Turkey a regional power have all incentivised the AKP to pursue a "Turkey first" approach to foreign policy. By putting its interests first, the country has started to establish transactional co-operation with countries with which it was previously a rival or had limited relations, such as Russia and China. On the downside, Turkey's foreign policy will leave the country strategically isolated, and Turkey's relationship with the US will become increasingly transactional. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations between Turkey and its Western partners. The watershed moment was the failed military coup by part of the Turkish military in 2016 and a perceived lack of Western solidarity in its aftermath. The subsequent resistance of the US to extradite a self-exiled Turkish imam, Fethullah Gulen, from the US for his alleged role in the failed coup further fanned the flames of anti-US sentiment in Turkey. Prior to the coup attempt both countries had already clashed on several issues, including the collaboration of the US with Iraqi and Syrian Kurds.
Turkey-US relations have reached fresh lows following Turkey's purchase in 2019 of the Russian-made S-400 air-defence system, which has resulted in the US blocking Turkey's purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets and Turkey's suspension from the F-35 production programme. We expect that Turkey will activate the missile-defence system in April 2020. This is likely to result in US sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act. We believe that sanctions will lean towards the less onerous side to avoid pushing Turkey completely into Russia's orbit and to ensure a degree of collaboration on other issues, including migrant, and refugee, inflows from Syria and Iraq.
Russia-West tensions are at their highest level since the cold war
Political tensions between Russia and the West are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Western countries have accused Russia of financing extremist opposition parties in western Europe, employing cyber-warfare against Western targets and engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West. Meanwhile, Russia is seeking to reassert its role on the global stage and is dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in 2015, and its subsequent breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and backing of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, resulting in a conflict in this region, has led to a further deterioration in Russia's relations with the West. The Minsk II agreement, signed in 2015, is unlikely to resolve the conflict. The current status quo of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting seems likely to endure for several years. This serves Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict prevents closer Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO, which Russia would view as a direct threat to its national interests. In response to Russia's actions regarding Ukraine, the EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials, as well as on the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. On August 3rd the US State Department announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia preventing it from issuing new US dollar-denominated debt on international markets. We expect these mutual sanctions to remain in place over the medium term, and it is likely that they will be expanded further.
The EU has labelled China a systemic rival. The BRI divides opinions
The EU has labelled China a "systemic rival" and has adopted a regulation setting up a framework to scrutinise foreign investments from non-EU countries, a move that is widely understood to be directed towards foreign direct investment from China. Although the EU supports improving connectivity between Europe and Asia (as pointed out in the EU Connectivity Strategy), it has not formally come out in support of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-China's flagship foreign policy initiative that aims to create a "New Silk Road" of trading routes, and to expand China's economic and diplomatic ties. However, despite the EU's reluctance to support the BRI, several European countries have signed up to it, including Italy, Portugal, Greece and several countries in the western Balkans.
One of the points of concern for the EU regarding the BRI is the near monopoly that Chinese companies enjoy in implementing these projects. Until transparency regarding the terms of BRI funding improves and the procurement processes are made more inclusive and competitive (allowing for participation from European companies), the EU is unlikely to change its stance on the BRI.
Macroeconomic policy
The Franco-German axis will drive foward some euro zone reform plans
The commitment in 2012 by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning-point for the bloc. In 2017 EU leaders renewed their push for further integration of the economic and monetary union to boost the bloc's resilience to future shocks, and in June 2018 Germany and France presented a shared set of proposals. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects progress to remain patchy.
We do not expect the emergence of the type of full fiscal integration that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been pushing for, but the strength of the Franco-German axis, with support from a number of southern member states, is likely to be sufficient to lead to a relatively ambitious set of reforms, which will nevertheless take several years to implement fully. These would include reform of the current bail-out fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which could be turned into something akin to a version of the IMF. Such a move could shift the responsibility for fiscal and economic monitoring of member states away from the European Commission to the revised ESM, and include restructuring of sovereign debt as a strict conditionality in any bail-out. One of the three pillars of the banking union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which has yet to be implemented, will continue to meet political resistance from several north European member states. The planned EDIS would increase the responsibility of healthy economies for bad debts in others.
France and Germany believe that a new EU industrial strategy is a priority
France and Germany have taken the lead in pushing for a new industrial strategy for the bloc, and also a potential revamp of EU competition policy, in the wake of the Commission's decision to block the planned merger between two train manufacturers, Alstom (France) and Siemens (Germany). Both coun-tries' ministers of the economy are pushing for a revision to EU competition law to enable such mega-mergers in the future, in order to build European champions capable of competing with the largest of their US and Chinese rivals. Their manifesto also argues for greater funding for innovation, and a European strategy to become a world leader in artificial intelligence, among other areas. They are also emphasising the need to develop more robust rules for screening inward foreign direct investment (FDI), especially from China. We expect continued French-German co-operation on these issues, with the aim of developing a more protectionist stance for the bloc.
Talks over the EU's next seven-year budgetary framework will be tough
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will start to emerge in the second half of 2019. The most contentious issue is the European Commission's proposal to increase member states' financial contributions to meet the shortfall created by the withdrawal of the UK, a major net contributor. Although some southern member states and Germany are willing to contribute more, fiscally hawkish countries such as Austria and the Netherlands oppose this. Another point of controversy is the Commission's proposed introduction of conditionality in the next budget cycle, linking the transfer of funds to rule-of-law compliance. This emerged in response to the illiberal drift in countries like Poland and Hungary. The idea has created an east-west split, but we expect that a version of the proposal will be approved.
The 2021-27 budget will also include a new, small euro zone budget, after a compromise was reached between France and Germany. Far from providing a fiscal stabilisation function-as favoured by Mr Macron-the euro zone budget will instead be channelled to countries looking to improve competitiveness and convergence. The topic has proved contentious among the so-called New Hanseatic League, a group of fiscally hawkish Nordic and Baltic countries led by the Netherlands.

Consensus on fiscal restraint is eroding, but we do not expect a substantial shift
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. Monetary policy looks set to remain as the main macroeconomic policy tool, not least after the ECB presented a substantial easing package on September 12th. This includes a cut to the deposit rate (to -0.5%, from -0.4% previously), enhanced forward guidance, another round of quantitative easing (QE2) and the introduction of a deposit tiered system.
Almost all European countries improved their fiscal position in 2009-18, and there has now been a widespread repositioning towards a looser stance. Although fiscal policy in the euro zone has become slightly accommodative in 2019 and will remain so next year, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis.
Nevertheless, there may be a greater appetite for some fiscal initiative in the coming period. Several factors make this more likely. First, Germany's economic slowdown is undermining the political opposition to balanced budgets-reforming the debt-brake rule embedded in the constitution is no longer a taboo. Second, a new Commission will take office on November 1st, and a discussion has started over revising the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) framework. Third, the ECB's most recent meeting gave a strong signal to governments that policy would remain ultra-loose until at least 2021, which will increase their fiscal space.
Some national governments are pushing back against EU fiscal rules
A major shift on this front remains unlikely in our view however. The average euro zone government debt/GDP ratio was 87.2% at end-2018, but Belgium, Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal all had ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the zone for many years. In addition, member states have strong disagreements over fiscal policy. Some have already pushed back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis.
The previous Italian government comprising the Eurosceptic far-right Lega had mounted a serious challenge to euro area fiscal rules, proposing an expansionary 2019 budget that the Commission regarded as violating the debt-reduction criterion of the SGP. The administration eventually reached a compromise with the EU institutions on a deficit target of 2% of GDP in 2019. We believe that the new pro-EU Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Partito Democratico (PD) administration has greater chances of obtaining some concessions from the EU on the fiscal front than the previous coalition, and that it will reach an agreement with the Commission on a 2.2% of GDP fiscal deficit target for 2020.
This will be achievable through lower interest payments on government debt (owing to a reduced risk premium and more accommodative policy by the ECB), some cuts in spending and an overhaul of the tax system. The removal of the flagship flat-tax extension of Matteo Salvini (the leader of the Lega)-with estimated revenue losses of about EUR15bn (0.9% of GDP)-will help to avoid a 3-percentage-point increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate (worth 1.3% of GDP). The deficit is then expected to average about 2.1% in 2021-23. Public debt, at 132.2% of GDP at end-2018, will remain near this level for the next five years.
The UK government has shifted towards a looser fiscal stance
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016-18, but the government has relaxed policy modestly in 2019 and is likely to continue to do so. Lower than anticipated public borrowing in 2018 has increased the "fiscal headroom" that the previous chancellor, Philip Hammond, banked, to £26.6bn (US$34.8bn), from £15.4bn. The current chancellor, Sajid Javid has promised over £13.8bn in additional expenditure, although this is probably continengent on the Conser-vatives being returned to power with a majority in the next election. The Labour Party is also expected to pursue a much looser fiscal policy.
The fiscal easing already planned for 2019, combined with a slowdown in economic growth, should cause a slight widening of the deficit this year, to 1.8% of GDP, from 1.5% in 2018. We expect a further expansion in 2020, to 2.3% of GDP, following from large one-off investments delivered by the Conservatives or Labour after the election, but we expect a gradual contraction to 1.5% by the end of the forecast period. We expect public debt to decline from about 87% of GDP in 2018 to less than 82% by 2023.
Fiscal performance has improved markedly across central Europe
As a result of robust economic growth and tighter controls on spending, fiscal performance has improved markedly across the central European countries in recent years, with the Czech Republic posting a budget surplus in 2018, and Poland and Slovakia both having deficits narrower than 1% of GDP. In Hungary, in contrast, fiscal loosening ahead of the April 2018 parliamentary election led to a widening of the budget deficit, to 2.2% of GDP in 2017 and in 2018. We expect narrow deficits of less than 1% in Slovakia in the 2019-23 forecast period and narrow deficits in the Czech Republic after 2020. However, the fiscal deficits in Poland and Hungary will widen over the forecast period, to 2% of GDP. We forecast that public debt, which is equivalent to 50% or less of GDP in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia-but is 71% of GDP in Hungary at end-2018-will continue to decline in all these countries. Given Hungary's high public debt, the country's fiscal position and currency will remain vulnerable to volatility on world markets.
Higher oil prices are easing fiscal constraints in Russia
The tight budget constraints facing Russia's government are abating owing to higher global oil prices. We expect international oil prices to average US$69/barrel in 2019-23, up from an average of about US$50/b in 2015-17. However, the Ministry of Finance intends to relax fiscal policy only slightly in 2019-21, and the government will maintain a fiscal surplus. Spending related to the "National Projects"-the government's plans for infrastructure modern-isation-will push up expenditure. Military spending will remain high as well, but some spending will be redirected towards health and education, as recently promised by the president, Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile higher global oil prices-and the government's conservative oil price forecasts (retaining a US$40/b oil price assumption)-almost guarantee that revenue will outperform expec-tations. We expect the budget, which returned to surplus in 2018, will not dip to less than 1% of GDP throughout 2019-23.
Turkey's fiscal position looks relatively solid
The public finances have traditionally been one of Turkey's most reassuring economic features. Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios reflect the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past. Higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits widened the deficit to about 2% of GDP in 2018, from 1.5% in 2017.
In 2019-after substantial fiscal stimulus-we expect the budget deficit to widen to 2.8% of GDP. In 2020-21 we expect a cautious approach to on-balance-sheet fiscal policy (concerns about off-balance-sheet trends will persist). This, alongside a recovering economy, will cause the deficit to narrow gradually, to 1.4% of GDP in 2021. We expect a widening of the deficit in 2022-23, with the shortfall reaching about 2.2% of GDP in 2023, owing to the presidential and parliam-entary elections that year. The central government debt/GDP ratio deteriorated slightly in 2018, rising to 28.7% of GDP in 2018 (from 28.3% in 2017). The ratio will decline slightly, to about 27% by end-2023, as macroeconomic conditions normalise.

The ECB adopted a loose monetary policy in response to the European sovereign debt crisis that began in 2011. Interest rate cuts were followed by the introduction of an asset-purchase programme, QE, in 2015. The programme ran until December 2018. Growth in the euro zone had accelerated significantly in 2017 and headline inflation was picking up. However, economic momentum softened substantially in 2018 and the underlying growth trend remained weak during the first half of 2019. Inflationary pressures have remained subdued, and the risk of deflation increased (market long-term inflation expectations have fallen significantly below the 2% target). This, together with a more subdued economic outlook for the bloc, has prompted the ECB to ease policy further.
The ECB will maintain a dovish stance
On September 12th the bank announced a substantial stimulus package, involving a small cut to the deposit rate; enhanced forward guidance; the restart of QE2; the introduction of a deposit tiered system, whereby some of commercial banks' excess reserves at the ECB are exempted from paying the -0.5% deposit rate; and more favourable terms for the third-round of cheap loans granted by the ECB, known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs-III). Crucially, the ECB decided not to put a specific time limit for QE2, and opted for an open-ended programme instead. This, together with its decision to link forward guidance to its mandate of "close to, but below, 2%" inflation-effectively showing that rates will remain low until inflation converges towards the ECB's target-have sent a strong signal to markets and governments that policy will remain ultra-loose until at least 2021.
The ECB's decision is part of a more general process of easing monetary policy that is occurring at the global level as central banks elsewhere also struggle with persistent geopolitical uncertainty and subdued inflation.
The BoE has paused its tightening cycle
The Bank of England (BoE, the UK central bank) raised its policy rate for the first time in a decade in November 2017 and again in August 2018. However, this year it has adopted a more dovish stance. The BoE revised down its forecasts for economic growth and inflation in August 2019, citing a weaker global environment and Brexit-related uncertainty, and voted to leave policy interest rates unchanged, at 0.75%. The bank still expects domestically driven price pressure to build gradually in the forecast period, but the timing of future rate rises will depend on the nature and outcome of Brexit. We expect the BoE to delay the next increase in the policy rate until the fourth quarter of 2020.
In the event of a disorderly UK withdrawal from the EU at end-October (not our baseline forecast), we expect the bank to make whatever policy changes are required to support economic activity. The BoE has emphasised that it is prepared for such an outcome; a worst-case scenario used in the bank's stress tests for the banking system involves a decline in the pound's value, higher unemployment and inflation, an increase in borrowing costs and a decrease in property prices. However, the UK's banking system has sufficient capital, and monetary policy would be loosened, unless the decline in sterling were especially sharp relative to the overall macro-economic shock.
Turkey still faces the risk of another sharp depreciation of the lira
Turkey's currency crisis in 2018 and the ensuing recession have put severe pressure on the government's finances, business sector solvency and banks' balance sheets. After the lira's sharp depreciation against the US dollar in August 2018, the Central Bank of Turkey raised its main policy rate to 24%, from 17.75% previously. Since then annual consumer price inflation has started to ease, and the MPC reduced its main policy rate to 19.75% in July. We expect rates to be cut again at the September MPC meeting as consumer price inflation eased in August, to 15% year on year, from 16.7% in July. By the October MPC meeting the central bank will have inflation data for September, which are likely to be slightly less than 10% year on year because of base effects. At this meeting we expect another decline in the main policy rate, which will bring it down by about 300 basis points in total with these two cuts.
We expect a gradual appreciation in the lira in the second half of 2019. This forecast assumes that the Turkey-US dispute will not result in damaging sectoral sanctions; that government policy will be credibly reoriented; and that the central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy stance, lowering interest rates only as price pressures fade. However, there are large risks to this forecast, with another sharp lira depreciation still a possibility. In 2020-23 we expect the lira rate to depreciate gradually against the US dollar as the current-account deficit widens and central banks in advanced economies re-embark on a path of monetary policy tightening.
We expect one or two rate cuts in Russia in 2019
In Russia in December 2018 the Central Bank of Russia (CBR, the central bank) increased its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 7.75%, in anticipation of the inflationary pressures expected in 2019, driven by an increase of the VAT rate and the resumption of foreign-currency purchases from January 2019. This pre-emptive rate increase in December 2018 was sufficient to offset this one-off price rise, and the CBR cut its policy rate by 25 basis points three times since then, to 7%. The CBR projects an annual inflation rate of 4-4.5% for 2019, which is broadly in line with our inflation forecasts. We expect the CBR to keep its policy rate unchanged for the remainder of 2019. However, any downward shock to global oil prices or new stringent sanctions on Russia would prompt the CBR to tighten policy quickly to soften the resulting depreciation of the Russian currency against the US dollar.
Many currencies in eastern Europe remain pegged to the euro
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to, or managed, against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of the Federal Reserve's and the ECB's policy trajectory. However, we do not believe that there are significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in North Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a cause for concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into the euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of a strong tourism performance, have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2019.
We expect broadly accommodative monetary policy stances in Central Asia
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, only Kazakhstan has allowed its currency to float. Given Kazakhstan's trade ties to the Russian economy, it would lose competitiveness if the tenge appreciated significantly against the rouble. Azerbaijan appears to have returned to a US dollar peg since April 2017. The monetary policy stances of oil-exporting countries, such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, are closely linked to oil price fluctuations, as the exchange-rate movements of these countries are closely linked to global oil prices (which determine export earnings). With global oil prices expected to remain firm in our forecast period, these countries will maintain an accommodative monetary policy, which will also support domestic economic growth.

Economic growth in the euro zone will lose momentum, but remain firm
The recovery of the euro zone economy from the global financial crisis of 2008-10 began in 2013, after the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, committed to doing "whatever it takes" to restore confidence in the euro. The recovery strengthened once this commitment was backed by a large-scale quantitative easing (QE) programme. By 2017 the euro zone's expan-sion had gathered sustained and broad-based momentum, and this, in turn, benefited neighbouring economies that receive EU funding and rely on EU trade. However, growth in the euro zone eased in 2018, and will moderate further in 2019. In the second half of last year the German economy stagnated and momentum softened in France, and Italy entered a technical recession.
Some of the reasons for the slowdown were temporary: adverse weather conditions, rail strikes and protests weighed on growth in France in 2018, and Germany's manufacturing sector was hit by changes to European car-emissions regulations and disruptions to freight transport. However, there has also been a marked deterioration in the external environment from 2018 and into 2019, with softer global trade and high geopolitical uncertainty, reflecting rising US-China trade tensions, the threat of a US tariff increase on EU automotive exports and the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit. Concerns about these issues, and a softening of demand across Asia, the euro zone, the UK and (to a lesser extent) the US, have fed into a decline in manufacturing data and sentiment indicators.
Against this less supportive external environment, domestic demand has remained firm, driving quarterly growth in the euro zone to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019-stronger than in the three previous quarters. High-frequency indicators such as consumer confidence, employment data and retail sales are robust, supporting private consumption, and a buoyant housing market, high capacity-utilisation levels and favourable funding conditions are fuelling investment. Across most of the bloc recovering labour markets, accommodative monetary policy and gradual fiscal loosening are supporting growth.
Nonetheless, the risks to The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast remain skewed to the downside. The most immediate risk is the US administration's threat to raise tariffs on imported European autos and auto parts (from 2.5% at present). Our core view is that the US will refrain from raising these tariffs. There is significant opposition to doing so in the US market, and with the next presidential election in November 2020, opening yet another front in the trade war would be a risky move. However, should the current dispute over subsidies at Airbus and Boeing, two aerospace companies, result in mutual tariff imposition, this would change the calcu-lation. The German economy is particularly exposed to this threat, given its dominant role in the European automotive industry and highly open economy.
We expect a mild technical recession in Germany this year
Real GDP growth peaked in Germany in 2017, at 2.8%, alongside a pick-up in global trade volumes. Growth slowed in 2018 as the external environment became less supportive, and we expect a technical recession this year, with two consecutive quarters of mild contraction, and annual growth averaging 0.5%.
The main driver of the German slowdown has been external, and we see three main aspects to this. First, there has been a noticeable slowdown in German exports to China, in line with slowing Chinese economic growth and the intensifying US-China trade war. Together, these have fed into slower global trade growth and weighed on euro zone business sentiment. Second, German exports to the UK have been hit by Brexit uncertainty. Third, the automotive sector is facing a number of challenges. Global car sales declined for the first time in a decade in 2018, reflecting slowing demand from China and structural shifts in the industry towards electric cars, car-sharing and strict emissions tests. All of these changes are disrupting the heavily diesel-focused German automotive sector.
That said, the country's domestic economic fundamentals remain strong, and the main driver of growth over the medium term will be private consumption, with investment also contributing robustly. The government has agreed on a more expansionary fiscal policy until 2021, and we expect further spending increases given the loss of momentum in economic growth this year. There is still strong commitment to keeping the budget in balance, but discussion about whether this remains appropriate has intensified significantly.
Growth will remain comparatively strong in France, in a European context
France's recovery from its slump in 2012 was slow by European standards, with growth recovering to its 2008 rate only in 2017, supported by a cyclical upswing in the euro zone. After real GDP growth of 2.4% in 2017, growth eased to 1.7% in 2018. We forecast a sharper slowdown, to 1.2% in 2019-although this figure is relatively robust in compared with Germany and Italy, and well above what we are expecting for Germany or Italy. In 2020-23 we expect annual average growth of 1.6% as recent reforms to the business environment start to bear fruit and (from 2021) external demand picks up. However, structural rigidities-especially regarding the tax system and the labour market-will not disappear entirely, and the country will continue to struggle to improve its competitiveness over the medium term, with often negative investor perceptions of the country likely to prove slow to change.
Italy's economy entered a recession in the second half of 2018
The Italian economy has softened since about mid-2018, contracting on a sequential basis in the second half of last year. Momentum has remained weak in 2019, dampened by domestic political and economic uncertainty, as well as global trade tensions. We expect that the economy will expand by a marginal 0.1% in full-year 2019, on the back of slower growth in private consumption and fixed investment, and less favourable external conditions. In 2020 the euro area's third-largest economy will fare little better, expanding by a modest 0.4% in real terms, as cooling external demand in the euro area and the weight of global trade tensions, as well as a slowdown in the US, continue to hold back an economic recovery. From 2021 to 2023 growth should return to closer to 1% per year on average, a respectable performance by Italian standards, but still weak in the context of euro area economies, as structural rigidities, a high level of sovereign debt, clogged credit channels and policy uncertainty continue to exert a drag on growth.
Structural reforms have improved the context for growth in Spain
In Spain, a combination of reform and austerity has given rise to a marked economic improvement since 2014. The financial sector is now in a better position, owing to reforms undertaken as part of Spain's EUR41.3bn bank bail-out process, and we believe that further episodes of instability-particularly at instit-utions of systemic importance-are unlikely. Meanwhile a landmark labour market reform implemented in 2012 lowered dismissal costs, clarified and narrowed the definition of unfair dismissal, reduced the collective bargaining power of trade unions, and made it easier for companies to cut wages and working hours. Further structural reform would improve the economy's medium-term prospects, but will probably proceed at a more gradual pace in 2019-23 compared with the reform-intense period under the absolute majority of the People's Party (PP) in 2011-15. Real GDP growth decelerated from 3% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018 as private consumption growth slowed slightly and external demand softened more significantly. In 2019 growth will slow further, to 2.2%, before cooling to about 1.9% on average in 2020-23 as euro area growth remains lacklustre and the global economy cools, owing to the lasting effects of the US China trade war and weaker growth in the US economy in 2020.
The recovery in Greece remains fragile, with political instability a central risk
Greece exited its third bail-out programme in August 2018, but we are sceptical that the country will experience rapid and sustained growth. Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Real GDP accelerated in 2018, but the economy lost momentum in the final quarter of the year. We expect real GDP growth to remain constrained, at about 2% in 2019-23. The risks to our forecast are balanced: upside risks include continued strong tourism performance if capacity constraints are addressed and competitiveness gains are not eroded; downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political and financial market instability.
The UK economy is suffering from the uncertainty stemming from Brexit
The UK economy was relatively resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016, but has lost momentum since 2018. In 2018 full-year growth was 1.4%, and the economy has continued to slow through 2019, contracting by -0.2% quarter on quarter in April-June. In line with our forecast that the current political impasse will lead to a delayed Brexit and a snap election, economic uncertainty will continue to weigh heavily on activity in 2019 and 2020, when we expect real GDP growth to slow to 1.1% for both years, with significant downside risks stemming from the possibility of a disorganised withdrawal from the EU.

The Visegrad countries will continue to post above-average growth rates
Much of central Europe faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding, such as the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) in particular, will register real GDP growth well above the EU average in 2019-23. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to begin in 2016, holding back activity in that year, but funds began to flow again in 2017-18, contributing to stronger economic activity, and projects are in progress that will support economic growth rates during 2019-23. Increased employment and soaring wages in the Visegrads-driven in part by a tight labour market-have fuelled private consum-ption since 2017, and this will continue in the forecast period. The slowdown in global trade growth, and in particular growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-along with the upcoming structural challenges facing the automotive sector, will weigh on growth in central Europe in 2019-20. However, still robust German investment spending and private consumption in Germany will help to sustain export demand.
Economic activity accelerated in south-eastern Europe, but is now moderating
In south-eastern Europe the economic recoveries are continuing, although growth has generally lost momentum. In the region's largest economy, Romania, the economy grew by 4.1% in 2018 after growth of 7% in in 2017, driven by private consumption, exports and a significant increase in inventories. We expect growth to decelerate to about 3.7% in 2019-20 owing to a weaker global environment and the consumption-led growth model reaching its limit. In Bulgaria, a recovery in domestic credit growth, a strengthening labour market and firmer real wage growth have underpinned the acceleration of economic growth in recent years. We forecast that real GDP growth in this country will average 3.2% in 2019, compared with 3.3% in 2018, before slowing to an average of 2.8% per year in 2020-23, reflecting less favourable global conditions and labour capacity constraints.
Structural imbalances in the western Balkans have been largely corrected
Economic activity in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) broadly picked up in 2015-18, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors, such as low oil prices in 2015-16 and a strong pick-up in demand from the euro zone in 2017. In 2018 the Serbian economy accelerated, bringing up the regional average after a decade of uneven growth. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the western Balkans should benefit from the structural reforms that are now in rpgress in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. Political cronyism, corruption, vested interests and a poor demographic profile are also a drag on growth across the region. We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans of about 3.3% in 2019-23.
Exchange-rate volatility has pushed Turkey into a recession
In Turkey government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand caused real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2017 (from 3.3% in 2016), but this surge exacerbated internal and external discrepancies. These imbalances-coupled with heightened policy unpredict-ability, foreign investors' concerns regarding the independence of the central bank, reliance on short--term capital inflows, tighter global liquidity and a diplomatic spat with the US-contributed to the lira depreciating by about 24% on average against the US dollar in 2018.
The sharp depreciation of the lira caused consumer price inflation to accelerate from already high rates, increased input costs for corporations and raised the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. Higher domestic interest rates and rising risk premiums further dented the economic outlook. The crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018. We expect the lira to remain volatile in 2019-23.
Growth in Russia will slacken this year
According to Russia's Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Russian real GDP grew by a surprisingly strong 2.2% in 2018-the fastest growth rate since 2012. The strong growth rate was largely driven by the inclusion in output data of investment in construction work at the third phase of the Yamal gasfield, as well as high levels of exports. This is unlikely to be sustained in 2019 owing to weaker growth in external demand, a new deal with OPEC to constrain oil production, and a lower projected grain harvest. Domestic demand is also likely to slacken this year owing to higher interest rates and an increase in value-added tax (VAT). International sanctions-and broader political and business uncertainty-will remain significant constraints on investment, as will the lack of a "culture of failure" (the absence of entrepreneurial spirit weighs heavily on innovation and investment). We forecast that economic growth will ease to 1.3% in 2019. In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low prod-uctivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth, to an annual average of 1.6% in 2019-23.
The possible end of Russian gas transit represents a large risk for Ukraine
Real GDP decreased by a cumulative 16.4% in Ukraine in 2014-15 amid conflict and a chaotic political situation. The disruption of these years accentuated a structural change in the Ukrainian economy away from heavy industry and towards agriculture. The economy has been recovering since 2016, driven by vigorous growth in private investment and private consumption. Real GDP growth stood at 3.3% in full-year 2018. Household spending continued to increase (supported by solid wage growth and high inflows of remittances) and investment remained robust.
In 2019-23 we expect average annual average real GDP growth of about 2.7% per year, with household consumption making the largest contribution to GDP growth in each year. However, soft global steel prices, rising production costs and a worsening external environment will weigh on growth, especially in 2019-20. The probable end of Russian gas transit in 2020-when the current transit contract expires and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to the EU is supposed to begin operations-represents a significant risk.
Growth rates in the CIS will be similar in 2019 to those recorded in 2018
Growth and exchange-rate movements in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are highly correlated to movements in global oil prices, especially in large oil exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Owing to important trade links and high levels of remittance flows, the performance of the Russian economy has an impact on that of smaller countries in Central Asia (the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) and the South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia, not CIS members). We forecast growth of 1.3% in Russia, 2.3% in Azerbaijan, 3.9% in Kazakhstan and 3% in Ukraine in 2019. Given our forecast for an oil price corridor of about US$60-75/barrel in 2019-23, the growth outlook for most countries is unlikely to diverge significantly from their 2018 final outturn.

Price pressures have eased again in the euro zone, after rebounding in 2017 and 2018-inflation accelerated to 1.5% in 2017 and 1.7% in 2018. This increase stemmed chiefly from higher energy prices, which have since reversed course. In 2019 we expect inflation to slow to 1.4%, even as domestic price pressures-stemming from tighter labour markets and firmer wage growth-sustains relatively decent price growth. Inflation will remain low in 2020, at just 1.5%, reflecting still subdued momentum and low global oil prices. From 2021-23 we expect prices to pick up.

Business environment rankings cover 82 countries
The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of 11 categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into 11 categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2014-18) and the forecast period (2019-23), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair are, in most countries, well under way. Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America, and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe, and Asia and Australasia, but a better performance than Latin America, or the Middle East and Africa.
EU countries and Nordics score particularly well in our rankings
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Business environment in eastern Europe has improved since 1990s
The investment climate of central and eastern Europe has improved consid-erably in recent years. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even there. Factors such as a low-cost, but well-qualified, labour force, proximity to developed markets, and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region over the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. Throughout the region, the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable. In Russia, the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the Russian government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. However, low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to seek to open up and diversify their economies.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Canada--highlights: Political outlook
The Liberal Party, led by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has shifted Canadian politics to the left since it won the election in October 2015. Its then surprise parliamentary majority has made the passage of legislation straight-forward, allowing the government to implement much of its policy agenda. The October 2019 federal election will nevertheless be a close contest. Mr Trudeau and his party enter the campaign with plenty of baggage, including some broken promises, and face a rejuvenated Conservative Party. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberal Party to remain in power, but there is a risk that it will lose its current parliamentary majority. This raises the prospect of periodic legislative gridlock in 2020-23, and diminished government effectiveness. Canada benefits from solid institutional stability and capability. The bureaucracy is efficient, but some functions are duplicated between the federal and provincial levels.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.
Canada rises to ninth place (out of 82) in our global business environment ranking in 2019-23, and into first place in the regional rank of G7 countries. The increase in Canada's overall score reflects improvements in areas such as infrastructure, technological readiness, and policy towards private enterprise and competition. These gains will more than offset modest declines in market opportunities and the labour market. As a centrist party, the Liberals are supportive of business and are unlikely to pass laws that would significantly hinder the business environment. Continued trade protectionism in the US will create uncertainty for business in Canada, which relies heavily on the US economy, but recent trade deals will help Canadian exporters to build markets elsewhere. The country's openness to trade will remain the most attractive feature of the business environment.
Canada--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP growth (%) 1.9 1.6 1.7 2.3 2.4 2.3
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 2.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.2
Budget balance (% of GDP) -0.4 -0.9 -1.0 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7

Exchange rate C$:US$ (av) 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3
We expect that real GDP growth will slow to 1.6% in 2019, dampened by slower private consumption growth and an economic slowdown in the US. Sluggish demand will keep growth below its long-term trend at 1.7% in 2020. Real GDP growth is expected to pick up again in 2021, and will average 2.4% per year in 2022-23. It will be supported by public investment in infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US. High household indebtedness will remain a major vulnerability.

Population growth   1.0 0.9
Working-age population growth   0.3 0.1
Labour force growth   0.8 1.0
Canada's population totals 37.1m and is expected to increase at a rate of just under 1% per year, to 38.7m, by 2023. Growth in the working-age population is slowing, and the number of pensioners is starting to rise sharply as the post-war baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1965) move into retirement. This will increase pressure on the country's health and pension systems in the forecast period (2019-23). Immigration will continue to drive population growth, as the fertility rate is well below the replacement level. However, immigration will not fully offset the shift in the demographic age structure.
Canada--highlights: Market opportunities

Household consumption per head (US$) 26,880 27,210 28,150 28,850 30,420 31,790
Canada is an attractive market because of its high income levels, but it is small compared with other, more populous countries such as the US. Households' high levels of debt will limit their spending power, as will rising interest rates towards the end of the forecast period. A generally stable operating environment will continue to make Canada an attractive destination for investment, skilled workers, cutting-edge research, science and innovation.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The Canadian economy is forecast to expand by an average of 2% per year in real terms in 2019-50. This is slightly slower than the 2.1% annual average growth achieved in 2000-18. Canadian exporters will seek new opportunities in Asia and Latin America, and trade agreements with the EU and Pacific countries will have tangible effects in the coming years. Successive governments will seek to address the slow pace of productivity growth. Enhancements to infrastructure and a focus on innovation, science and technology will lead to modest improvement in this area.

a Actual.
Background: The Canadian economy was the tenth-largest in the world in 2018 (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates). It is highly integrated with the US economy, which absorbs 75% of its goods exports and is the source of 51% of its imported goods. The US exerts a powerful economic and cultural influence on Canada. Fifty-eight per cent of Canadians say that English is their mother tongue; just over 21% say French and just under 21% have another language as their first. The majority of French speakers live in Quebec, Canada's second most populous province. Canada's unity is sometimes called into question, but support for independence is currently muted in Quebec. Neither of the two leading political parties in the province is seeking an independence referendum.
Political structure: Canada is formally a constitutional monarchy, with the governor-general (always of Canadian nationality and appointed in Ottawa) acting as the representative of the British crown. In practice, the Canadian House of Commons (the lower house of parliament and main legislative body) is sovereign. Canada is a federation of ten provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan), each with substantial powers, and three territories (Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Yukon). At the federal level are the Commons, the main seat of legislative power, and the non-elected Senate (the upper house), which plays only a marginal role. The Liberal Party has led a majority government since 2015; the next general election will be held on October 21st 2019.
Policy issues: The current federal government is attempting to balance the assistance that it is providing to the fossil fuel industry through approving new oil pipelines with maintaining its green credentials. The government will increase its spending on infrastructure significantly, including through its Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Taxation: The federal corporate income tax rate is 15%. Provincial governments charge corporate tax at rates between 2% and 16%. In 2016 the government introduced a new top marginal rate of personal income tax of 33%, which applies to taxable income higher than C$210,371 (US$159,200) in 2019.
Foreign trade: The US absorbs about three-quarters of Canadian exports, so the health of its economy is crucial for Canada. Canada's trade deficit was US$17bn in 2018, and the current-account deficit was US$45.3bn (2.6% of GDP).

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The 42nd parliament was dissolved on September 11th 2019 ahead of the federal election, which will take place on October 21st. Four years after the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, led the governing Liberal Party to a surprise majority in the 2015 federal election, ending a decade of government by the Conservative Party, Mr Trudeau is seeking a second term. The Liberal Party had 177 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons (the lower house of parliament and main legislative body), at the time of dissolution, while the Conservatives had 95. The New Democratic Party had 39 seats. The Senate (the upper house) is in the midst of a broad transformation that will make all 105 senators non-partisan. There are currently 29 Conservative senators, 58 independents, nine Liberals, seven non-affiliated senators and two vacancies.
Political outlook: Political stability
The 42nd parliament has been dissolved ahead of the federal election, which will take place on October 21st. The Liberal Party government, led by Mr Trudeau, won a majority at the previous federal election, in 2015, ending a decade of Conservative Party rule. The government has made progress on much of its agenda, but controversy over political interference in a criminal corruption case has tarnished Mr Trudeau's political brand. The Liberals have regained most of the ground lost in opinion polls at the peak of the affair earlier this year, and are virtually tied with the Conservatives. The election results will be tight, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Liberals to remain in government after the election. However, the party's parliamentary majority is at risk. This raises the prospect of periodic legislative gridlock, and a modest deterioration in political stability in 2020-23.
Mr Trudeau contends that his government has reduced poverty and unemployment and has fulfilled promises by cutting income taxes for the middle class and legalising cannabis. However, other pledges have been broken, such as reforming Canada's first-past-the-post voting system. Mr Trudeau is also burdened by the recent findings of the parliamentary ethics commissioner that he attempted to obstruct the course of justice in the criminal prosecution for alleged bribery of SNC-Lavalin, a large Quebec-based engineering firm (which denies the charges). The Conservatives promise to make life more affordable by ending the national carbon tax, removing value-added tax from home-heating fuel, and embracing "nation-building projects", such as oil pipelines, to create more jobs. Mr Trudeau argues that a Conservative government would cut public spending and revive policies of Stephen Harper, the former, Conservative prime minister.
Opposition parties strongly opposed to the federal Liberal government's environmental legislation have taken control of provincial governments in Ontario and Alberta in the past 15 months, setting the stage for policy battles at the federal election and beyond. The Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, whose United Conservative Party defeated the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) government at the provincial election in April, claims that the federal government's environmental policies have harmed Alberta's resource-based economy. He has repealed the carbon tax in the province, which was introduced by the former NDP government. As a result, the Liberal government plans to introduce (in January 2020) the same national carbon tax in Alberta that it imposed in April on four other provinces-Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick-that did not have pricing plans that met federal standards. The provincial governments in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta contend that the national carbon tax is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court of Canada will ultimately rule on the matter later this year.
The nationalisation in 2018 of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project has also raised questions regarding federal jurisdiction. The expansion, designed to carry additional crude oil from Alberta to a port in British Columbia (BC), is opposed by the NDP provincial government in BC and by environmentalists. The federal cabinet's decision in June to proceed with the project is controversial and will be a central election issue. The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, who backs the project, claims that Mr Trudeau is not committed to the pipeline expansion.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The quality of the bureaucracy in Canada is exceptionally high, and the incidence of corruption low. The legal system is highly efficient and transparent. The political system will remain effective. The Liberal majority in the House of Commons since 2015 has meant that opposition parties have been unable to block government legislation. More than 100 bills were passed through both chambers and received royal assent since the Liberals formed the government. Key legislation included bills ratifying the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and an act to make recreational cannabis legal in Canada. We expect the Liberals to be re-elected on October 21st-only two majority governments have failed to be re-elected for a second term. However, a minority government is the likeliest possibility, which would force either a Liberal or Conservative-led administration to negotiate with other parties to pass legislation, reducing overall political effectiveness.
The Liberals have failed to overhaul the first-past-the-post system
Mr Trudeau had major plans to revamp Canada's political institutions when he won office in 2015. He has been partly successful. The Liberals had pledged that the 2015 election would be the last to use the first-past-the-post system, but after national consultations on a replacement, the government decided to stay with the current system. The issue is unlikely to be revisited over the forecast period (2019-23). In December 2018 legislation changing some parts of the election process was passed, including limiting the length of election campaigns to 50 days and making spending by political parties and third parties more transparent. The legislation also allows Canadian citizens living abroad to vote regardless of how long they have been overseas. The government also proposed a series of changes to how the House of Commons conducts its business. The watered-down version that passed in mid-2017 puts an obligation on the government to explain why it has delayed the House of Commons from meeting, when that has occurred, and gives the speaker of the Commons the power to divide omnibus bills into smaller sections.
Canada is a decentralised federation, with the provinces exercising jurisdiction in many areas, including natural resources, health and education, and securities regulation. This can be a source of strength, in that each of the ten provinces and three territories is free to experiment with policies, allowing the others to watch and then adopt proven practices. However, it is also a source of weakness, because it makes the setting of national policy in areas of shared jurisdiction difficult and sometimes impossible. Tensions arise in areas of shared jurisdiction, such as environmental policy. Governments can, and have, appealed to the courts to sort out jurisdictional battles. The NDP government in British Columbia (BC), which opposes the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline, intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada after the BC Court of Appeal ruled in May 2019 that proposed provincial legislation restricting the increased flow of oil into BC conflicted with federal jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines. Governments generally abide by court decisions, either abandoning their proposed course of action or addressing flaws that judges have identified.
Political outlook: Election watch
Following the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Conservative Party overtook the Liberals in opinion surveys in February 2019, but support for the Liberals has since recovered. According to an aggregate poll published on September 12th, 34% of respondents supported the Conservatives, compared with 33.7% for the Liberals. The NDP was well behind, backed by 12.6% of those surveyed, followed by the Greens on 10.8%.
We expect the Liberal Party to remain in government after the federal election on October 21st, although it could fall short of an absolute majority. The Liberals have the advantage of incumbency, and will highlight their record on middle-class income tax cuts, raising the child benefit, and climate-change policy. However, the contest will be tight. The Conservatives will focus on the Liberal government's perceived vulnerabilities, namely higher government spending, the cost of its environmental policies and the rising cost of living. The opposition will also highlight the issue of trust, given the Liberal government's broken pledge on electoral reform, its failure to balance the budget by 2019 as stated in the 2015 election campaign, and the SNC-Lavalin affair. The Conservatives also contend that the Liberals have lost control of the border by allowing more than 45,000 people to walk across from the US over the past two years and claim asylum.
Political outlook: International relations
The Liberal government's foreign policy will continue to emphasise multilateralism, mitigating the effects of climate change and upholding human rights. The contrast with policies pursued by the US president, Donald Trump, will continue to strain bilateral relations during the remainder of Mr Trump's administration. Canada will nonetheless seek to preserve relations with the US, by far its most important diplomatic and economic partner. Canada will also increase efforts to diversify trade.
The signing in November 2018 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and preserve the trilateral arrangement, has mitigated some trade risk for Canada. The revised deal maintains most of the substance of the earlier one; in particular, the USMCA retains the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, on which Canada relies to protect some of its industries (primarily lumber) from potential US anti-dumping measures. Canada also negotiated an exemption from any future tariffs that the US might impose on automotive imports, and the US has been granted greater access to the Canadian market for dairy, poultry and eggs (these sectors are managed by the government to ensure sufficiently high prices for farmers). Mexico has already ratified the deal, but political hurdles in the US, and Canada's parliamentary recess until November 2019, mean that full ratification will probably be delayed until 2020.
China is a major target for exporters, but relations are fraught
China was a major target for the government's trade diversification policy until December, when Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, was detained in Canada at the request of US authorities on fraud charges (that she denies). Bitter exchanges between Canada and China since her arrest have cast a chill on bilateral relations. In response, China has detained two Canadians on charges of spying, sentenced two others convicted of drug crimes to death, and has used non-tariff barriers to impede agricultural imports from Canada. In early September the government requested bilateral consultations with the country at the WTO, the first step towards launching a formal complaint on China's blocking of Canadian canola (rapeseed) imports. Bilateral relations will remain tense for as long as Ms Meng faces the threat of extradition to the US.
The implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to provide enhanced access to major Asian markets over the 2019-23 forecast period. A trade deal signed with the EU in 2016 has removed 98% of the EU tariff lines; when the deal is fully implemented, that figure will rise to 99%.

Canada rises to ninth place in The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business environment rankings in 2019-23 (the forecast period) and moves into first place in the regional rank of G7 countries. The increase in Canada's overall score reflects improvements in areas such as infrastructure, technological readiness, and policy towards private enterprise and competition. These gains will more than offset slight declines in market opportunities and the labour market. Taxes and labour will remain the least favourable aspects of the business environment.
Canada performs best in the foreign trade category. Most of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) came into effect in September 2017. In 2018 Canada ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which is in force for six of the 11 signatories. Full implementation will provide enhanced access to major Asian markets. The signing in November 2018 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has eliminated much of the uncertainty surrounding the US-instigated renegotiation of the deal. Despite complications over timing, we continue to expect that ratification of USMCA will be completed in 2020.
We expect the Liberal government to remain in power after the federal election due in October 2019. However, it lost a major ally in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, after the Liberal government there was defeated in June 2018. This was followed by the return to provincial government in Alberta of the United Conservative Party in April 2019. In Canada's decentralised feder-ation, where provincial leaders can be powerful adversaries, this will make national policymaking more challenging. As a centrist party, the Liberals are generally supportive of business and are unlikely to pass any laws that would significantly hinder the business environment.

Household debt and exposure to the US will remain vulnerabilities
Canada's score in the macroeconomic environment category is unchanged in 2019-23, but the country slips 14 places in the global rankings to 35th as economic prospects in other countries improve. We expect real GDP growth to slow, at a below-trend 1.6% in 2019 and an average 1.7% in 2020, reflecting slower domestic demand and the negative effect on the US economy (and hence Canadian exports) of the escalating US-China trade war. Growth will return to an average of about 2.3% per year in the latter years of the forecast. A central area of vulnerability in the economy is household indebtedness, which remains near record-high levels. A series of government measures have helped to cool the overstretched housing market, reducing the risk of a major correction, but prices remain inflated. Another vulnerability is Canada's economic dependence on the US, its main trading partner, which purchases about 76% of Canadian goods exports and supplies 51% of goods imports. The high level of regional integration between the US and Canada and complex crossborder supply chains mean that the Canadian economy is heavily exposed to an economic downturn in the US, as well as increased trade protectionism and other policy changes pursued by its neighbour. Some Canadian firms have redirected investments to the US after its corporate tax reform in 2018. The government will continue efforts to diversify Canada's export markets.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

Canada will remain one of the most favourable environments for private enterprises. The country's score rises to 9, from 8.8 previously, although its global and regional (G7) rankings are unchanged at fifth and second respectively. In 2018 the federal government nationalised the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project, which had been undermined by environ-mental protests and obstruction by the provincial government in British Columbia (BC). The federal government gave final approval for the expansion project in June 2019, although construction work could be delayed further by legal challenges. Assuming that it goes ahead, the pipeline will greatly increase capacity to transport crude oil from Alberta and allow oil producers to diversify their markets. There are 45 Crown Corporations (state-owned enterprises) at the federal level. Only a few compete directly with the private sector, and they are subject to the Competition Act to prevent abuse of dominance. Foreign investors can also challenge them under the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or NAFTA (and will also be able to do so under its successor, the USMCA, once it is ratified).
Intellectual property rules will be tighter under the USMCA
In April 2019 the US removed Canada from the high-priority watch list of countries that it believes do not adequately protect intellectual property (IP). However, Canada remains on the lower-level watch list, owing to ongoing concerns about pharmaceutical patents, online piracy and counterfeit goods. The US attributes Canada's removal from the priority list to expanded IP provisions in the USMCA and harsher penalties in recent Canadian court cases.
Canada's supply management system for dairy, egg and poultry production controls prices and restricts imports through high tariffs. These markets will be partially opened up under CETA, the CPTPP and the USMCA, although the overall impact on domestic producers is expected to be small. For example, it is estimated that Canadian dairy farmers will lose a total market share of 8% once all the agreements are fully phased in.
The other major area of federal government price control is patented medicines, for which Canadians pay among the highest prices in the world. New regulations aimed at reducing the price of patented medicines will take effect in July 2020. The Liberal government is expected to firm up its commitment to a national pharmacare plan at the October 2019 general election, although it will take several years to implement. Under a national plan, the federal government would have more clout negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies, resulting in lower prices.
In March 2019 the Competition Bureau released new abuse of dominance enforcement guidelines. The main changes include the removal of the 35% "safe harbour" threshold, under which firms with a market share of below this level would generally not be subject to examination by the bureau. The market share threshold for further investigation has, in effect, been lifted to 50%, unless there is other evidence of a substantial degree of market power.
The impact of the new project approval process is uncertain
In June 2019 parliament passed legislation (Bill C-69) aimed at giving investors greater clarity on the regulatory process for approving major projects (including resource projects), ensuring that affected communities and indigenous groups are fully consulted, and reducing the possibility of project approvals being challenged in court. However, critics of the legislation contend that it will create more red tape and deter investors.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards foreign investment

Canada remains in tenth place in the global rankings for this category, and in first place among the regional (G7) economies. The two main political parties will maintain a welcoming policy towards foreign investment. Two large divestments by foreign oil companies of operations in Canada's oil sands contributed to a sharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada in 2017, but FDI rose to a three-year high in 2018 (at US$45.4bn, or 2.7% of GDP). Further progress will be hampered by global economic headwinds, volatility in oil prices, and uncertainty caused by the US administration's trade policies.
The US is by far the largest source of FDI in Canada, accounting for almost half of the FDI stock in 2018, although this share has declined over the past decade. Trade and tax policy in the US will nevertheless continue to affect foreign investment in Canada. For example, the reduction in the US corporate tax rate as part of that country's tax reforms in 2018 increased the relative attractiveness for US firms of investing at home rather than in Canada. The Liberal government has introduced some mitigating measures, such as enhanced tax breaks on capital expenditure.
Regulations governing broadcasting and telecoms will be modernised
Canada maintains foreign ownership restrictions in a few industries, although some were loosened in 2018, and further relaxation is possible in the forecast period. In mid-2018 the government raised the limit on foreign ownership of Canadian air carriers that provide passenger and cargo services to 49% (from 25% previously). A final report and recommendations on modernising the legislative framework governing broadcasting and telecommunications will be published in January 2020. Non-Canadians cannot currently hold a broad-casting licence and are restricted to 20% ownership of a telecommunications common carrier. Canada also reviews foreign investments above certain thresholds, set at C$1.05bn (US$0.8bn) in 2019 for private firms from WTO members and C$1.57bn (US$1.19bn) for firms in countries covered by a trade agreement. In May 2018 the government blocked the US$1.2bn purchase of Aecon, a construction company, by a Chinese state-owned firm, on grounds of national security. Successive governments will be open to most foreign invest-ments in the forecast period, but those proposed by state-owned firms will come under increasing scrutiny.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.
Foreign trade and exchange controls are the best-rated feature of Canada's business environment, and the country maintains its top global ranking in this category. In the WTO's rankings for 2018, Canada was the 13th-biggest exporter, with a 2.3% share of global exports, and the 13th-biggest importer, with a 2.4% share of imports.
Given the openness of the Canadian economy, in which one in five jobs are linked directly or indirectly to exports, free trade will continue to be supported strongly by the two major political parties in the forecast period. However, policies in this area will be constrained in part by the need to maintain close relations with the US, which absorbs the vast majority of Canada's exports. The renegotiation of NAFTA in November 2018 will help to ease short-term concerns about trade policy. We expect the US and Canada to ratify the USMCA, the treaty that will replace NAFTA, in 2020, although political obstacles on the US side could affect this timeline. Mexico ratified the new agreement in June 2019.
Canada has made some compromises that will further open its markets in order to reach agreement on the USMCA. Central among these are a 16-year sunset clause, greater access for the US to Canada's dairy and poultry industries and modification of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. However, the new agreement preserves another dispute-resolution mechanism (Chapter 19 of NAFTA), on which Canada relies to protect some of its industries, notably lumber, from potential US anti-dumping measures. The USMCA also includes tighter rules of origin in the auto industry, an important sector for Canada, and tougher rules on IP and digital trade. Tariffs imposed by the US on Canadian steel and aluminium imports in June 2018, on the grounds that they represented a threat to national security, were lifted in May 2019, but the US government has warned that the tariffs could be re-imposed if steel and aluminium shipments from Canada were to surge in the future.
The CPTPP will provide greater access to major Asian markets
Trade tensions with the US have revived efforts to diversify trade. Much of the CETA with the EU came into force in 2017, and the CPTPP, an agreement between 11 Pacific countries, is currently in effect for six of the signatories. However, the Liberal government's attempts at strengthening trade ties with China have stalled. China has little interest in including non-economic areas considered crucial by Canada, such as the environment and IP protection, in a trade agreement. Moreover, relations with China have soured following the arrest and detention by Canada of a senior executive of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, on charges that she denies, and the blocking by China of some agricultural imports from Canada in retaliation. Although the spat will eventually blow over, formidable barriers need to be overcome before a trade deal can be agreed. Progress on a proposed comprehensive economic partner-ship agreement with India has been slow and a deal is unlikely to come into force in the forecast period.
Canada's accession to the UN Arms Trade Treaty in September 2019 will entail new regulations on arms brokering, formal assessment criteria for export permits and increased transparency in the reporting of arms exports. Textiles and clothing are also subject to export controls, as are nuclear goods and technology, and softwood lumber. Canada will maintain import controls on some agricultural products, especially dairy and poultry products where domestic output is tightly controlled, although the full implementation of recent trade deals will lead to a partial opening-up of these markets.
Canada has sanctions and related measures in place against 19 countries, including Russia, North Korea and Iran. In 2017 parliament passed legislation to impose sanctions and take other restrictive measures against foreign officials who violate human rights, the so-called Magnitsky law.

The tax category has traditionally been one of Canada's weakest, largely because of the complexity of the tax system, which is a mixture of federal and provincial tax regimes. Canada's score edges up to 7.1 in the forecast period. However, the country slips to 25th in the global ranking for this component and to second position in the regional (G7) ranking.
Permanent reductions in corporate tax rates are unlikely
US tax reform in 2018 removed the tax advantage held by Canada for more than a decade by reducing the US average combined federal-state corporate tax rate to 26%, slightly below the average combined federal-provincial rate in Canada of 27%. Businesses in Canada will continue to press the federal government to reduce the corporate tax burden. However, persistent budget deficits will limit the ability of the federal government, and some provincial governments, to implement permanent reductions in corporate tax rates.
Canada has a separate corporate tax rate for small businesses, the federal component of which was reduced to 9% from January 2019, from 10% previously. Small businesses fiercely resisted plans by the Liberal government to make tax avoidance more difficult. The government was targeting wealthy individuals who used the tax system to reduce their tax, but many legitimate enterprises were caught in its proposed net. The government made significant changes before implementing the final measures, which reduce access to the small business rate and a refundable tax. The Liberals reduced personal income tax rates for the middle class and raised them for high-income earners soon after they won the 2015 election. We do not anticipate further major changes to personal tax rates in the forecast period.
A Conservative government would repeal the federal carbon tax
The federal carbon tax will remain controversial. In April 2019 the federal government introduced a carbon tax of C$20 (US$15)/tonne in the four provinces without their own carbon pricing programmes: Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. The tax will rise by C$10 each year, to C$50 per tonne by 2022. The Liberal government plans to introduce the same tax in energy-rich Alberta from January 2020, after the new United Conservative Party government in that province dumped the existing carbon tax in May 2019. The federal Conservative Party will repeal the federal carbon tax if elected in October. Assuming that the Liberal government is returned to power, provincial governments are likely to seek a ruling from the Supreme Court of Canada on whether the federal carbon tax is constitutional.

Tight regulation, cautious lending policies and continued improvements to oversight will maintain the soundness of the banking sector in 2019-23. Canada maintains its score of 8.5 in this category and remains in first place in the regional (G7) rankings. The federal government regulates banks and federally incorporated institutions in the trust and loan, life insurance, and property and casualty insurance subsectors. Credit unions, caisses populaires (co-operatives), securities dealers and exchanges are mostly regulated by the provinces. The government is in the process of updating legislation governing financial institutions to reflect new technologies and to factor in demographic changes that are changing business models and consumer relationships.
The government is undertaking a financial systems update
Amendments to the Bank Act legislated in December 2018 include enhancements to corporate governance, responsible business conduct, disclosure and transparency, and customer redress systems. Changes to the deposit insurance system that will come into effect in 2020-21 include extending coverage to foreign-currency deposits, removing term limits on guaranteed investment certificates, and adding new deposit categories, to ensure that every registered product is covered up to the same C$100,000 (US$76,000) limit.
As part of the update to the financial system, the government is modernising the structure of three payment systems. The 1999 large value transfer system (LVTS) will be replaced by newer infrastructure called Lynx by 2021, and the 1984 automated clearing settlement system (ACSS) will also be replaced by a more efficient retail system. The third change involves a new real-time retail payment system. The Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) does not own the payments systems but provides settlement accounts to the participants of all three systems. We expect these changes to be completed within the forecast period.
The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has sophisticated trading and settlement systems, but will continue to face competitive pressure from the larger markets in the US and from electronic share-trading networks. More than 100 Canadian companies, including almost all of the major ones, have shares listed on foreign stock exchanges, most commonly the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. At end-July 2019 there were 1,566 issuers on the TSX, and the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) had 1,700 issuers. Energy and mining companies account for more than 40% of issuers on the TSX/TSXV. Aequitas NEO, an exchange backed by a number of banks, asset managers and pension funds, began trading in March 2015 as a rival to the TSX. In July 2019 it had more than 90 corporate and exchange-traded fund listings.
The six major Canadian banks will remain profitable, reflecting in part the oligopolistic nature of the market. Canada's banking sector, especially retail banking, is among the least competitive and most profitable in the OECD. This has allowed domestic banks to charge high fees for basic services such as cash withdrawals and debit-card payments. The banks' pricing power is a recurring source of political controversy. However, growth in mobile payment and other online services will gradually force the banks to become more competitive. The banks' capital position is solid and will provide a buffer against losses. The banks currently maintain capital and leverage ratios above regulatory requirements.

Canada's score for this category slips to 6.8 in the forecast period, reducing its global ranking to 24th, although it remains in second place in the regional (G7) ranking. Canada's labour market is robust. The unemployment rate of 5.7% in July 2019 remains close to a 40-year low, although it varies greatly across the country. Using US statistical methods, the unemployment rate in Canada was 4.6% in July, compared with 3.7% in the US. Wage growth, which had been subdued since the 2014 commodity price drop, has picked up in 2019, with year-on-year growth in hourly wages averaging 3.5% in April-August. However, with the labour market expected to soften in 2020-21, we do not anticipate a breakout in wage growth over the forecast period.
The Liberals will lift annual permanent resident admissions
According to the latest quarterly business outlook survey published by the BoC in June 2019, reports of labour shortages have increased from a low level in the previous survey, but are not widespread. To address a shortage of skilled workers, the federal government launched a global skills strategy in 2017 to make it easier and quicker for firms to bring skilled workers to Canada. A start-up visa programme, which began in 2013 as a pilot project, became a permanent pathway for immigration to Canada in 2018. Just over 321,000 permanent residents were admitted to Canada in 2018, which was the highest number since the current data series began in 1972. The government's latest three-year immigration plan commits to increasing annual permanent resident admissions to 350,000 in 2021, which will be equal to nearly 1% of the population. The major political parties will continue to support immigration.
Labour rigidity will increase under federal employment reforms
Employment reforms being phased in from September 2019 will reduce labour flexibility and push up costs for federally regulated industries such as banking and transport. The changes include enhanced leave entitlements and a relaxation of minimum length-of-service requirements for eligibility, mandatory notice periods for changing employee shifts, tighter rules on breaks and new pay equity rules.
Sluggish productivity will remain a problem, defying efforts by the government to boost innovation, encourage investment in machinery and equipment, and increase FDI flows. Successive governments will attempt to tackle the problem through infrastructure investments, innovation programmes and investing in skills training.
About 4.8m Canadian workers belong to a union, 2.8m of whom are in the public sector and the rest in the private sector. The unionisation rate, which dropped steeply in the 1980s and 1990s before assuming a more moderate decline, was 28.1% in 2018. There were 80 major work stoppages in Canada in 2018, down from 175 in 2017 and well below the average for the previous seven years.

Canada performs well in the infrastructure category. Its score rises to 8.8 in the forecast period, lifting it to fifth place in the global rankings, and retaining first place in the regional (G7) rankings. The Liberal government is investing C$180bn (US$137bn) over 12 years to improve infrastructure. Owing to its large geographic size, Canada has an extensive road and highways network. A survey by Statistics Canada published in 2018 indicated that the country had more than 765,000 km of publicly owned roads in 2016. One of the newer additions is a 120-km, all-weather road from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories, which opened in 2017. The link between Canada's Arctic Coast and and the areas south of this region is important for northern inhabitants and resource development in the territory.
More than half of the highways (59%), local roads (52%) and arterial roads (52%) in Canada were in very good or good condition, according to the Statistics Canada survey. There were 47,279 publicly owned bridges and 351 publicly owned tunnels. Only about one-tenth of bridges and one-tenth of tunnels were in poor or very poor condition. The federal government spent C$4.2bn replacing the Champlain Bridge linking the island of Montreal to the south shore, and about C$5.7bn will be spent constructing the Gordie Howe Bridge linking Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, Michigan. The new Champlain Bridge opened in July 2019 and the Gordie Howe Bridge (replacing the Ambassador Bridge) is due to open in 2024.
Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline gets the green light
The oil industry and the provincial government in Alberta have been calling for the construction of more pipelines to bring additional crude oil to global markets. Existing pipelines to the US are also near capacity, forcing exporters to move an increasing amount of crude oil by rail. The proposed Trans Mountain Expansion project will almost triple the capacity of the existing oil pipeline and allow shipments to markets beyond the US, the current destination of most oil exports from Alberta. The project, now owned by the federal government, received the final go-ahead in June 2019. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, although further legal challenges could delay completion, currently scheduled for 2022. Legal challenges and opposition from environ-mentalists have further delayed construction of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Nebraska. Following a decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court in August 2019 affirming approval for the route, construction could get under way in 2020. The Liberal government rejected the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the British Columbia (BC) coast in 2016.
Businesses complain about lengthy approval processes for pipelines
Complaints about lengthy, expensive and redundant approval processes for major projects, including pipelines, have led the federal government to revamp the process. Legislation passed in June 2019 is meant to streamline approvals for major projects, give investors greater clarity on the regulatory process, ensure full consultation with indigenous groups and reduce the risk of project approvals being delayed by court challenges. However, critics of the legislation claim that it will actually make it harder to get new pipeline and resource projects approved. Canada generates more electricity than it needs, exporting 9% of the 652.3 terawatt-hours (TWh) generated in 2017 to the US. About 60% of the electricity consumed in Canada is generated by hydro, 15% by nuclear, 10% by gas or oil, 9% by coal and 7% by non-hydro renewables.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), a government agency, has set a goal that by 2021 90% of Canadian homes and small businesses will have access to fixed broadband that offers internet speeds of up to 50 megabits per second (Mbps) in downloads, with an unlimited data allowance. According to the CRTC's 2019 Communications Monitoring Report, 84.1% of Canadians have access that meets these targets, although the proportion falls to 37.2% for rural areas. The agency says that 99% of Canadians have access to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) mobile wireless services (commonly referred to as fourth-generation, or 4G, technology), but the service is limited or non-existent in some rural and remote areas. About 86% of major transport roads and highways have access to LTE. The 2019 federal budget earmarked C$1.7bn in new funding towards achieving a new target that 95% of Canadian homes and businesses have access to internet speeds of at least 50 Mbps in downloads by 2026.

Canada has a solid performance in this newly created category, which shows how future-oriented the business environment is, including the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Canada scores 8.9 in the forecast period. It ranks 19th in the global rankings and is in second place in the regional (G7) rankings.
Internet access is almost universal
The most recent data published by the International Telecommunication Union, in mid-2019, show that 87% of households had internet access at home-well above the global average. The percentage of people with fixed broadband subscriptions was 39%, and the percentage with mobile-phone subscriptions was 89%. Households will continue to drop landline telephone services in favour of mobile-only service, with almost a third having already done so, according to the CRTC. In mid-2019 4G availability from the three major mobile operators ranged from 88% to 90%, and operators have begun testing for fifth-generation (5G) technology services. The federal government intends to hold an auction in 2020 for the 3,500-megahertz spectrum necessary for 5G services.
At least 87% of individuals and virtually all businesses make some purchases online in Canada. Credit cards dominate e-commerce payments in Canada, accounting for about 90% of such purchases. One reason for this is security, as nearly two-thirds of users find a credit card safer, although reward schemes are also a factor. This dominance is likely to continue as the popularity of mobile online and in-app transactions continues to rise. Almost one in two Canadians use a mobile device to purchase products or services online, and this proportion will grow during the forecast period.
Canada ranked 23rd out of 193 countries in the UN's 2018 e-governance survey, doing well in the provision of online services and content, and in having the human resources to promote and use information and communications technology (ICT), but lagging in the adequacy of the telecommunications infrastructure. The Liberal government announced a new cyber-security strategy in 2018, and established the Canadian Centre for Cyber-Security to centralise units previously dispersed across the government and co-ordinate government responses to cyber threats.
Canada's reputation as a hotspot for artificial intelligence research will grow
Canada is among the top ten countries with the largest volume of top-cited scientific publications. A study by the Council of Canadian Academies in 2018 of Canada's research and development (R&D) found that the country's international standing was at risk because of a sustained slide in private and public investment in R&D (which stands at 1.7% of GDP, according to UNESCO). However, the study found pockets of R&D strength across several industries. One area is artificial intelligence (AI), where Canada is in the top ten countries filing AI patents. In 2017 the Liberal government set up and invested in the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy. This was followed in December 2018 by the announcement of C$230m (US$174m) in funding for a Quebec-based AI-Powered Supply Chains Supercluster, a collaborative venture to build intelligent supply chains through AI and robotics. In 2018 Samsung (of Korea) opened AI research facilities in Toronto and Montreal-the main hubs for AI research in Canada. Google (of the US) also has AI research facilities in both cities.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government will seek to support domestic industries that are adversely affected by US trade protectionism and Canada's trade issues with China. Measures to boost the competitiveness of Canadian businesses following tax cuts in the US last year included a tax break on capital expenditure in manufacturing. However, the government will struggle to balance environ-mental policy with support for the fossil fuel industry. It has rolled out a national carbon tax of C$20 (US$15)/tonne in provinces that did not have an equivalent carbon pricing programme in place. This tax will rise to C$50/tonne by 2022. However, the government has also approved the controversial expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which it now owns. To ease concerns about the apparent contradiction, the government has pledged to recycle all profits into clean-energy projects. The pipeline expansion could be delayed further by legal challenges.
Policymakers will continue to monitor the residential property market, which will remain a risk owing to overleveraged Canadian households. Measures introduced by the federal government and provincial governments in Ontario and BC in recent years have helped to cool the tight housing market. In Vancouver and Toronto foreign buyers are subject to an additional tax on property purchases, and the federal government has tightened mortgage requirements nationwide, which has improved the quality of new mortgage lending. According to the monthly Teranet-National Bank National Composite House Price Index, prices softened in September 2018-April 2019 but edged up in May-July. Despite falling mortgage interest rates, The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects the housing market to remain sluggish in 2019, reflecting a combination of tighter lending standards and continued affordability pressures. However, the risk of a major correction appears to have eased for now.

General government debt 93.6 93.1 92.9 91.5 88.6 87.7
The government is committed to a programme of infrastructure and other spending that will entail a series of budget deficits, but these will be partially offset by increased receipts due to the introduction of the carbon tax and greater tax income as a result of cannabis legalisation. However, lower average oil prices in 2019-20 compared with 2018, and a slower pace of economic expansion, mean that government receipts are likely to undershoot official projections overall, weighing on plans to reduce the fiscal deficit.
According to the federal budget for fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) handed down in March, the budget deficit for 2019/20 will be C$19.8bn (US$14.9bn)-equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. Official projections show the budget deficit contracting to C$9.8bn (equivalent to 0.4% of GDP) by 2023/24. We project that the fiscal deficit will expand from 0.4% of GDP in 2018 (our fiscal forecasts are calendar-year based) to 0.9% of GDP in 2019 and 1% of GDP in 2020. The government will seek to reduce the shortfall in the longer term, and we expect the deficit to contract gradually, to 0.7% of GDP by 2023. The deficit would be likely to fall more quickly under a Conservative government.

It has been almost a year since the Bank of Canada (BoC, the central bank) last changed its policy rate, the overnight rate, lifting it by 25 basis points to 1.75% in October 2018. A solid improvement in the economy during the second quarter of this year and the return of consumer price inflation to around the mid-point of the central bank's 1-3% target range have allowed the BoC to buck the recent trend of some other central banks in cutting rates-at least for now. However, at its latest interest rate announcement, on September 4th, the BoC warned that the escalating US-China trade conflict had caused world trade and business invest-ment to soften, and indicated that it would pay close attention to global develop-ments and their impact on the outlook for Canadian growth and inflation.
We forecast that the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) will follow up the cut to its policy rate in July with three more 25-basis-point cuts in September and December this year, and in March 2020. On balance, we continue to expect the BoC to keep its policy rate unchanged until January 2020, when we expect it to sanction a 25-basis-point cut amid a further weakening in US growth; because of the linkages between the two countries, this will weigh on economic growth in Canada. However, the chances of an earlier rate cut in Canada are increasing. The BoC will begin to tighten monetary policy gradually again from 2021, as economic growth picks up.

Real GDP growth slowed to 1.9% in 2018, from 3% in 2017, and we expect the pace of economic expansion to soften further in 2019, to an average of 1.6%. High household debt levels and the subdued housing market will weigh on private consumption growth this year, although solid growth in government spending will help to cushion the impact. A fall in gross fixed investment in the second quarter has led us to revise our forecast for this component, which we now expect will contract by 1.3% this year (we previously forecast a 1.5% expansion). The impact of this and other minor tweaks on our overall real GDP forecast has been offset by an upgrade to our projection for export growth. However, export growth will still moderate this year, as a result of weaker economic expansion in the US, Canada's main export market.
The renegotiation of North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) reduces one of the major downside risks to our forecast, although the timeline for the ratification of the successor agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), will be extended into 2020. Canadian producers and manufac-turers will benefit from the removal in May of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports, and the end of the retaliatory import tariffs that Canada imposed, but are feeling the pinch from trade restrictions imposed by China on some Canadian farm exports, such as canola. Global trade uncertainty remains a major downside risk to our forecast. Other risks to the economic outlook include a sharp drop in global oil prices, which would act as a drag on economic activity.
At 1.7%, real GDP growth will remain well below its long-term trend next year as economic growth in the US continues to slow and domestic demand in Canada remains sluggish. Real GDP growth is expected to pick up again in 2021, and will average 2.4% per year in 2022-23. This will be supported by continued public investment in infrastructure and stronger export growth, driven by recovering demand in the US and enhanced trade ties with the EU and CPTPP members.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
The primary sector has begun to recover from the precipitous fall in oil prices in mid-2014. As the fourth-largest oil exporter in the world, Canada has been highly exposed to what proved to be a structural shift in the oil industry. The partial recovery of global oil prices since 2018 will spur renewed interest in investments in the oil-producing provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador in the coming years. However, the rapid expansion of the US shale sector complicates the outlook for the Canadian fossil fuel industry. The US is by far Canada's largest market for energy products, which makes greater US energy independence a challenge for Canadian drillers. This will encourage the sector to pursue its plans to diversify its sales to include Asian markets through the development of additional pipeline capacity, although environmental concerns will remain a challenge. Canada also has large deposits of various metals, including copper, metal and silver. Coal is becoming less popular, but is still extracted, mainly for use in power stations.
The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector's share of nominal GDP has remained stable at about 2.1% in recent years. The Canadian agricultural sector benefits from abundant land, high productivity and a strong export tradition. This has enabled it to avoid the declining trend evident in many other OECD economies. We expect the sector to maintain its share of GDP in the forecast period (2019-23). The US will gain greater access to the Canadian poultry and dairy markets as a result of the NAFTA renegotiation, although the supply-management system for these sectors will remain in place. The federal govern-ment will offer compensation to Canadian dairy farmers to help to mitigate the loss of market share. In August 2019 the government announced a compen-sation package worth C$1.8bn over eight years to compensate Canadian dairy farmers for increased dairy imports as a result of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade-Agreement (CETA) and the CPTPP.
Currency developments have a sizeable impact on the manufacturing sector
The manufacturing sector enjoyed several years of modest recovery following the 2008-09 global financial crisis, although its vitality was constrained by the strength of the Canadian dollar (against the US dollar and other major currencies). The local currency has depreciated against the US dollar since 2015, and we forecast that it will remain at around this lower level in the forecast period. However, the Canadian manufacturing sector has so far struggled to take full advantage of this, owing to uncertainty in the past couple of years over the NAFTA renegotiation and the application of multiple tariffs on Canadian exports to the US. One of the largest manufacturing sectors, motor vehicles and parts production, faced the possibility of significant disruptions on both the supply and demand sides from an end to NAFTA. The removal in May 2019 of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports, and the successful negotiation of NAFTA's successor, the USMCA, in late 2018 has removed much of the risk. However, the US and Canada have yet to ratify the agreement, and the current US administration's unpredictable trade policies will remain a source of uncertainty.
We expect the services sector, which accounts for about 70% of nominal GDP, to experience decent, but not stellar, growth in the forecast period. The sector expanded by an average of 2.3% per year in 2016-18, and is forecast to grow by 2.2% per year on average in 2019-23. Flat house prices will weigh on the real estate sector in 2019-20, and high household debt will dampen consumer credit growth. The services sector will also be affected in 2019-20 by slower growth in the US, reflecting the close ties between the economies. The transport and distribution segments will, however, benefit from Canada's ongoing economic expansion and a reduction in internal tariffs due to the Canadian Free-Trade Agreement signed in April 2017. The deal will also provide a boost to retail and wholesale services. Furthermore, support services for the oil and gas industry will be boosted by construction of new infrastructure to increase transport capacity for crude oil from Alberta.

Labour costs per hour (US$) 19.3 19.5 20.1 20.5 21.4 22.2
Consumer price inflation fell back to 1.6% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, owing to lower petrol prices and the impact of previous monetary tightening by the central bank. However, it picked up to 2.2% in the second quarter, underpinned by higher food and energy costs. Subdued economic growth and generally lower oil prices will keep inflation at about 2%, the mid-point of the BoC's 1-3% target rate, overall in 2019-20. We forecast that the inflation rate will pick up from 2021 as the economy regains momentum and the unemployment rate starts to fall again.

Lower oil prices and slowing growth weighed on the currency in the first few months of 2019, although the Canadian dollar has firmed against its US counterpart since June owing to the Fed's dovish stance. The Canadian currency will nevertheless depreciate slightly this year, to C$1.32:US$1 on average. Downward pressure on the Canadian dollar next year from continued weak economic growth, soft oil prices and modest monetary easing by the BoC in January 2020 will be mitigated by deeper interest rate cuts from the Fed. As a result, the local currency will be unchanged, at an average of C$1.32:US$1 in 2020. A pick-up in growth and the resumption of monetary tightening will underpin a modest appreciation in the Canadian dollar in 2022-23, with the currency forecast to average C$1.30:US$1 in 2023.

The exchange rate, commodity prices and the health of the US economy will continue to shape the outlook for the current account, which will remain in deficit in 2019-23. The impact of softer global oil prices and export growth in 2019-20 will be more than offset by slower domestic demand and, therefore, import growth, compared with 2018, causing the merchandise trade deficit to narrow. As a result, we expect the shortfall on the current account to ease to an average of 2.2% of GDP in 2019-20. The CPTPP, the effects of which will begin to be felt from 2020, will result in higher trade volumes between Canada and Pacific nations. This will help to narrow the current-account deficit to a forecast 2.1% of GDP by 2023.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Canada
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays an important role in the Canadian economy. According to IMF data, FDI inflows fell from US$59.6bn in 2015 to US$27.5bn in 2017, but rebounded to US$45.4bn (equivalent to 2.7% of annual GDP) in 2018. This was despite uncertainty surrounding the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations, increased US protectionism and a reduction in the US corporate tax rate, which eroded the decade-long tax advantage enjoyed by Canada. Inward FDI has held up well in the first half of 2019. The stock of FDI in Canada stood at US$973bn in 2018, equivalent to 56.8% of annual GDP.
Origin and distribution
The US is the biggest source of direct investment in Canada, with US companies owning 46% of the stock of FDI in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. However, the ratio has generally been on a downward trend since 2004, when the share was 64%. European nations are another major direct investor. The Netherlands was the largest single source among European countries, accounting for 12% in 2018 (probably for tax reasons); Luxembourg was second, with 6% (also for tax reasons), followed by the UK and Switzerland, with shares of 6% and 5% respectively. The combined share held by European countries has risen by nearly 5 percentage points since 2008, to reach 38% in 2018. Among Asian nations, China's share of the FDI stock (excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) was on a long-term upward trend, albeit from a low base, but its share slipped back slightly, to 1.9% in 2018. Japan accounts for a slightly larger share, at 3.3%, but will eventually be overtaken by China. There are high levels of foreign ownership in many sectors of the economy, particularly in manufacturing, which accounted for 23% of investment holdings at the end of 2018. However, the share of manufacturing has fallen from about 33% in 2008. Mining, oil and gas accounted for the next biggest slice, at 20% of the total stock of FDI in 2018.
Determinants
Close physical proximity has been the driving force behind US foreign investment in Canada and has encouraged the integration of the two economies. Canada's attraction as a destination for US investment was enhanced when the free-trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries came into effect in 1989. Under the FTA, almost all tariffs on trade in goods were abolished, and many US companies restructured their operations to treat the US and Canada as a single market. FDI projects in Canada are vetted by a federal ministry, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, but few are rejected. Under NAFTA, which superseded the FTA in 1994, less restrictive conditions exist for investments by US and Mexican firms. This will continue under NAFTA's successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Similar conditions were granted for private-sector firms from the EU as part of the Canada-EU free-trade agreement (CETA). Canada has an attractive business environment for foreign investors and scores highly in most categories of The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings.
Impact
FDI inflows make up a significant share of overall fixed investment spending. FDI inflows from the US have been a catalyst for improving efficiency, raising productivity and promoting diversification of the Canadian economy. They have also helped to generate strong trade flows between the US and Canada, create new jobs and raise living standards. However, there is a risk of foreign acquisitions "hollowing out" the Canadian economy and turning domestic manufacturing into a part of the US supply chain.
Potential
Although the stock of inward FDI as a percentage of GDP in Canada is fairly high compared with other developed countries, there is still potential for large-scale inflows in the medium term, and FDI stocks are expected to remain strong in the forecast period (2019-23). Successive Canadian governments have introduced measures to promote inward investment, including low-cost financing, increased skills training for workers and reductions in business taxes. The current federal government is also keen to promote inward investment, and has raised thresholds above which proposed investments must be reviewed to ensure that they are of net economic benefit to Canada.

Immigration will drive population growth
Canada's population was an estimated 37.1m in 2018; it expanded by 1% per year on average in 2014-18. Population growth has been steady at around this rate for the past two decades. The slow rate of growth in the working-age population has caused this cohort to shrink as a ratio of the overall population. This, combined with a growing number of retirees, will increase pressure on the country's health and pension systems in the Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast period (2019-23). The Canadian population is younger than those of most other G7 countries (with the exception of the US), and it will age more rapidly than its neighbour to the south. Like most other industrialised countries, Canada experienced a post-war baby boom (1946-65). The number of seniors as a percentage of the population in Canada has exceeded the proportion of children since 2015, revealing an ageing population. For most of the last century natural increase through birth has been the main driver of population growth in Canada. However, migration has taken over (and will remain) the major driver of growth as fertility rates remain unchanged. According to Statistics Canada, migration accounted for over three-quarters of population growth in 2017/18, the highest proportion on record, with natural increase accounting for the remainder. This trend will continue as the superior quality of life and the accommodative environment continue to attract skilled human capital, refugees and asylum-seekers.
Young immigrants will slow, but not stop, Canada's ageing trend
Immigration will dilute, but not reverse, ageing trends in Canada. It has been the main driver of population growth since the late 1990s. According to the 2016 census, 22% of the population are foreign-born individuals residing in Canada after going through the immigration process, which is among the highest proportion in the G7. It is projected that this share could reach up to 30% by 2036. The government will come under periodic pressure to reduce the number of foreign workers in order to encourage employers to hire more Canadians. The temporary foreign worker (TFW) programme is meant to help employers who cannot find workers owing to labour or skills shortages.
An unflattering report by the auditor-general, Michael Ferguson, in mid-2017 suggested that the programme was widely abused by employers and that government oversight was poor. As a result, the government has tightened compliance arrangements, including checks that potential employers have fulfilled requirements to ensure that no Canadian citizen is available to fill the position, and to ensure that potential employees understand their rights.
The percentage of Canadians of working age is forecast to fall progressively from 69% in 2013 to 65% in 2023 and 62% by 2030. By this point the baby boomers will have largely retired. It would take sustained high levels of immigration during this period to prevent the labour force from shrinking. Life expectancy in Canada has been rising in line with other industrialised countries over the past three decades, and will continue to do so. In 2012 the Conservative government announced a gradual rise in the official retirement age from 65 to 67, but this was undone by the Liberal government in 2016, which announced that it would remain at 65.

Imports of goods & services (% change) 2.9 1.1 1.8 2.1 2.5 2.4
Canada will continue to provide the market opportunities consistent with a rich, mid-sized economy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that GDP per head will reach US$54,847 by 2023, measured at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Household consumption per head is forecast to reach US$31,790 by 2023. We expect the economy to grow at a weaker pace in 2019-20, when US economic activity slows owing to the effects of the escalating bilateral US-China trade war. Generally, however, a stable operating environment should make Canada an attractive destination for investment, skilled workers, cutting-edge research, science and innovation. There could also be some profitable opportunities in banking, telecommunications, the media and airlines, especially as restrictions on ownership in these sectors will be gradually eased.
High income levels will continue to compensate for a mid-sized population
Canada is an attractive market on the basis of its high income levels, but market opportunities will be limited by the small size of the population, which, at about 37m in 2018, is only one-ninth the size of the US. Size could act as a deterrent to market entry for some businesses, which would prefer to establish a direct presence in the US or concentrate on other countries offering greater market scale. Uncertainty about the timeline for full ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), adds a source of risk. However, NAFTA will remain in place until the USMCA takes effect, and it is unlikely that the US government will decide not to proceed with the new deal.
Income levels tend to vary across provinces in Canada. More than 60% of the population live in Quebec and Ontario provinces, where the majority of the major urban centres are located. Rural provinces tend to have lower average incomes and are much more sparsely populated.

Canada remains one of the most developed countries in the world
Canadian social indicators rank the country among the most advanced in the world. Average life expectancy, at about 82 years, is one of the highest in the world, and the infant mortality rate stands at fewer than five deaths per 1,000 live births. After occupying the top position during most of the 1990s, Canada's ranking in the UN Development Programme's Human Development Index has dropped in recent years, and the country ranked 12th in 2018. The widely admired Canadian healthcare system (a mixture of public provision and private top-up opportunities) has led to some of the lowest mortality and illness rates in the Western world. The mortality rate per 1,000 of the population stood at 7.5 across all age groups in 2018. Yet, at 10.7% of GDP in 2018, healthcare spending was below the G7 average of 14.2%.
An ageing population will put a strain on the healthcare system
As in most developed countries, the Canadian population is ageing. This trend will drive gradually increasing demand for more healthcare, personal care and old-age care services. Other services aimed at the retired, such as leisure activities, could also get a boost. A consensus exists in Canadian society on the necessity for high spending on social services. This is being reinforced by the Liberal government, which has introduced a more generous child benefit programme. Spending initiatives announced under past governments proved popular, and Canada's social welfare system is politically secure. Canada is a world leader in all levels of education, and continued spending in this sector should allow it to retain its lead over the US and many other OECD countries.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Canadian economy to expand by an average of 2% per year in real terms in 2019-50. This is slower than the 2.1% annual average growth achieved in 2000-18, which was supported by an increase in household debt and Canada's close economic ties with the expanding US economy, but it remains a solid pace of growth for an advanced economy. Overstretched Canadian households will be cautious about accumulating more debt, and the US economy is forecast to grow at a more moderate pace. Nonetheless, the US will remain among the more vibrant developed economies in the long term, which means that Canada will continue to benefit from the bilateral relationship. Canada will also seek to diversify its trade and economic ties in response to the wave of protectionist sentiment in the US. Developing economic ties with the EU and Asian economies will ensure alternative sources of export growth in the long term.
Initial conditions. Canada already has many of the foundations of long-term prosperity. The most important is its bilateral relationship with the US, which we do not expect to be unduly affected by the replacement of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada also benefits from one of the best business environments in the world. It rates especially highly for openness to foreign trade, policies towards private enterprise and competition, a wide range of market opportunities and the widespread availability of corporate financing. Even in areas where it scores less highly, such as the labour market and taxes, it still fares well compared with its peers in the G7. The Canadian workforce is highly skilled, with average years of schooling per worker among the highest in the G7 countries.
Canada's productivity lags that of the US
However, Canada also faces a productivity challenge, as output per worker has lagged behind the US. Owing to the government's commitment to a swathe of infrastructure enhancements and a focus on innovation, we expect labour productivity growth to accelerate from an average of 0.8% a year in 2000-18 to 1.5% in 2019-50. Excessive wage regulation could also be addressed by the federal government to increase labour market flexibility. Despite the deregulation of most domestic consumer markets, liberalisation in several industries remains a politically contentious issue, particularly in financial services.
Demographic trends. Like many other developed nations, Canada faces the problem of an ageing population and falling birth rates. Inflows of migrant workers, and increased participation of women and older people in the workforce, will ensure that the labour force continues to expand. Nevertheless, the size of the labour force in relation to the total population will shrink over the long term.
The first baby boomers-the large number of Canadians born between 1946 and 1965-reached the retirement age of 65 in 2011, and this is triggering a jump in the proportion of retirees in the population. The share of the population over the age of 65 stood at 17.2% in 2018, and this proportion will reach 25% by 2050. This has implications for healthcare spending and other assistance to the elderly, such as homecare and institutional care, and the partially funded public pension system.
An ageing workforce weighs on productivity growth
The number of Canadian workers aged 55 or over has increased significantly in the past two decades, and the average retirement age in 2017 was 64, up from 61 in the late 1990s, according to Statistics Canada. The government will continue to encourage greater participation in the workforce among pensioners, women and discouraged workers, and to permit higher immigration. Although these measures will support continued modest growth in the workforce, improving labour productivity will be crucial for the country to maintain its high standard of living. Technological development and innovation are a major consideration in driving productivity and growth.
External conditions. The share of Canada's output that is internationally traded is high. Exports of goods and services account for nearly a third of GDP, with about 75% of exported goods sold to the US market. Canadian exporters have long hoped to reduce their reliance on the US economy. The government signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the EU in 2017, and has ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In the longer term, Canadian firms will increasingly try to tap the Chinese market while remaining more receptive than their US counterparts to flows of Chinese capital into the domestic economy.
Canada's institutions are strong and credible
Institutions and policy trends. Canada has strong political institutions and a reputation for sound policy. This could be tested by the Liberal government's decision to break with Canada's adherence to fiscal surpluses. We forecast that the government will run wider deficits for longer than it has promised voters. However, we also believe that the government appreciates the areas on which Canada needs to focus to improve its long-term performance. These include the need for investment in public infrastructure, and targeting education and skills training to support a largely knowledge-based workforce. Given the efforts of previous administrations to reduce the stock of public debt, the country will continue to enjoy cheap access to financing, as its debt burden will remain low.
Our long-term projections assume that the confederation remains intact. This is an important assumption, as the threat of Quebec breaking away is never absent. Support for independence is well below the levels last seen in the mid-1990s, but it could rise again if demands for greater autonomy are not fulfilled.
Long-term performance: Real GDP growth per head is forecast to average 1.3% per year in 2019-50. This is a respectable result by historical standards, with average growth in the past two decades standing at the same level. This forecast assumes rising labour productivity gains, aided by government initiatives, to mitigate the effects of an ageing population. The growth rate in the US will also play a role, given the importance of the US market for Canadian exporters, until a point when Canada is able to diversify trade relations and is less reliant on the performance of the US economy.
Our base case assumes only a modest improvement in a few select categories of an already attractive business environment, but there is still room for further gains. If the government tackles the issue of over-regulation in the labour market while committing extensive funding to improving infrastructure and skills training, long-term growth could accelerate. On the downside, the economy is vulnerable to a prolonged period of weak growth or recession should household debt burdens become impossible to service as interest rates rise, the US slip into a long recession, or the Chinese economy suffer a disorderly debt-driven downturn. Each of these scenarios would require a recovery that would reduce our long-term growth forecasts.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
This year The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and finds that the economy will be 1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth. As a developed economy and strong proponent of combatting climate change, Canada will enjoy a strong capacity to manage the effects of climate change through government intervention, as well as through action by consumers and businesses. Nevertheless, changes in climate will have important repercussions, particularly for the economy, owing to a significant reliance on oil and gas exports. The development of alternative resources will require heavy investment, and would mark a painful transition as labour mobility issues arise in provinces that rely on fossil fuels for employment and growth. Furthermore, changes in global temperatures will have a bearing on the agricultural sector. Prolonged winters and higher average temperatures during summer are likely to disrupt established cropping patterns, affect agricultural productivity and yields, and necessitate innovation to sustain productivity. This would put government spending under pressure, as investment would be needed to shield the country against such changes, provide assistance to affected sectors and create a better social net to protect labour markets during the phase of transition. Changing consumer tastes and preferences towards responsibly and sustainably sourced products will also drive multiple changes, such as motivating businesses to innovate supply chains and prompting elected officials to have robust climate change agendas and, consequently, more stringent environmental regulatory requirements.
Technological developments
Canada's growth prospects in the long term will rely on increased investment in science, technology and continued innovation. This will be necessary, as increased mechanisation and an ageing population will reduce the contribution that conventional factors of production, labour and capital command in determining productivity. In order to boost total factor productivity and to promote efficiency between how labour and capital resources interact, the state will play a greater role in integrating the public sphere and private organisations to drive innovation. This has been reiterated in Canada's long-term science and technology strategy. High levels of technological development would allow Canada to digitise public services in order to improve the quality and administration of services offered. Investment in advanced technology will also allow Canada to mitigate against likely labour shortages arising from the ageing population. The government is also bolstering efforts to attract investment in core research and technology areas, where the country holds a leading edge.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Peru--highlights: Political outlook
The president, Martín Vizcarra of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio, assumed office in March 2018 after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), resigned amid corruption allegations. Mr Vizcarra made anti-graft reform a centrepiece of his policy agenda. However, given that progress on passing institutional reform has almost always been precipitated by a major stand-off between the executive and the opposition-controlled legislature, Mr Vizcarra has proposed a constitutional reform to bring the general election forward by one year to April 2020, as a way of giving Peru a fresh start. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that elections will advance and that a centrist government will come to power, there are significant risks to both assumptions.

Peru's business environment score rises in the 2019-23 forecast period, mostly owing to improvements in the political environment and government policy towards private investment, moving Peru up to 43rd place in the global ranking, and third in the regional ranking. Peru's strengths are its openness to foreign trade-secured by multiple free-trade agreements-and its prudent macroeconomic management. The business-friendly approach that existed during the historical period (2014-18) will be deepened by the current and the prospective government. Infrastructure will expand, although significant gaps will persist. Peru's labour market, albeit improving, will remain the weakest aspect of the business environment in terms of the global and regional rankings.
Peru--highlights: Economic outlook
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Real GDP growth (%) 4.0 3.0 3.4 3.9 4.1 4.3
Consumer price inflation (av; %) 1.3 2.2 2.0 2.7 2.9 3.0

Exchange rate S:US$ (av) 3.3 3.3 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.2
GDP growth will average 3.7% in 2019-23, driven by a recovery in private investment. In the longer term, growth will hinge more on productivity improvements, as commodity prices will be lower than during the 2000s boom. Social and political pressure for higher public spending will persist, but the fiscal accounts will remain prudently managed and characterised by one of the lowest debt stocks in the region. The stable macroeconomic outlook will also be underpinned by low inflation and a manageable current-account deficit.
Peru--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2013 2018 2023

Population growth   1.1 1.2
Working-age population growth   1.3 1.3
Labour force growth   0.9 1.5
The labour force will expand more quickly than the overall population in 2019-23, contributing to a demographic bonus over the next two decades. The formal economy, despite having expanded relatively firmly in recent years, will struggle to absorb new entrants to the labour market. As a result, the level of informal employment will remain high. Underdevelopment in rural areas will encourage the trend towards urbanisation, which stands at close to 80%. There should be further improvements in education and health indicators, in line with lower levels of poverty (which has more than halved since 2000). However, high levels of deprivation will persist in rural and indigenous communities.

Household consumption per head (US$) 4,550 4,650 4,870 5,320 5,860 6,460
Peru is a fairly small market and opportunities will remain restricted by low purchasing power measured in terms of GDP per head, as well as by high levels of poverty and inequality. However, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class, notably in the capital, Lima. Rising demand from lower-income districts has led to a transformation in consumer patterns. Although progress will be gradual, we expect this trend to continue in 2019-23. Public investment in infrastructure will support greater integration of outlying regions.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Growth in Peru's real GDP per head is forecast to be roughly stable, at around 2.4% in 2019-50. The demographic bonus will have run its course by the early 2030s, weighing on growth. Education levels will remain low, with only modest progress forecast. Low inflation and a stable currency will contribute to macroeconomic stability. Abundant opportunities in energy, mining and infrastructure will continue to attract investment. Nevertheless, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and the prices of commodities.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: More than 12 years of military rule ended in 1980. Following a decade of economic and social instability, the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) ended hyperinflation, advanced reforms to liberalise the economy and defeated the Maoist Sendero Luminoso insurgency. However, Mr Fujimori also subverted Peru's democratic institutions and committed grave human rights abuses, and his government collapsed over a corruption scandal. Subsequent governments have been successful in consolidating macroeconomic stability, but have largely overlooked the structural reforms required to raise productivity levels. The current president, Martín Vizcarra, has used much of his political capital to undertake political reform in order to address Peru's vast institutional deficiencies.
Political structure: The 1993 constitution established a presidential regime, elected for five years. Consecutive re-election is not permitted. A 130-member unicameral legislature-elected at the same time as the president-also sits for five years. The government is decentralising revenue and responsibility to the 25 regions, including the constitutional province of Callao.
Policy issues: The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that there will be a continuity of orthodox economic policies and that the business environment will remain attractive. Policymaking will be guided for the foreseeable future by the competitiveness and productivity plan developed by the Vizcarra administration, which focuses on strategic policy areas, such as infrastructure, human capital development and financial inclusion. Comprehensive labour reform, however, will remain elusive. Bilateral free-trade agreements with Peru's main trading partners-including the US, China and the EU-as well as initiatives within Latin America, will help to keep investment and trade flows strong in 2019-23.
Taxation: The corporate income tax rate is 29.5% (mining companies that do not benefit from tax-stability contracts pay additional taxes). Dividends and other profit-distribution schemes are taxed at 5%. Branch-profit tax is levied at 30% and remittance tax at 10%. Interest paid abroad stands at 5%.
Foreign trade: Tariffs are levied on imports at 0%, 6% or 11%. The World Bank's calculation of the average effective tariff was 1.4% in 2014. Most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated. In 2018 merchandise export earnings increased by 8% to US$49.1bn, while the import bill grew by 8.1%, to US$41.9bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The president, Martín Vizcarra of the centre-right Peruanos Por el Kambio (PPK), took office in March 2018 after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-18), resigned after being implicated in a corruption scandal. Mr Vizcarra is governing from a precarious position, with a series of defections from PPK in the aftermath of Mr Kuczynski's resignation leaving the ruling party with just five legislators in the 130-member Congress. However, it is not just PPK that has seen its position diminished in recent months. Political instability and high-level corruption scandals have led to the weakening of multiple legislative caucuses, including that of the dominant opposition party, Fuerza Popular (FP). Mr Vizcarra has not sought to build a multiparty governing coalition, choosing instead to use very high levels of public support for his reform agenda to pressure lawmakers into passing legislation. Consequently, relations between the executive and legislative branches have been fraught with conflict.

Political outlook: Political stability
Despite taking office under strained circumstances, Mr Vizcarra has made significant progress in enacting an agenda of institutional reform. However, as a political outsider without a governing coalition, he has been forced into employing political brinkmanship in order to get his legislative agenda passed. On multiple occasions, Mr Vizcarra has made political reforms the subject of a vote of confidence in his administration in order to force legislative debate on those issues. Under Peru's constitution, the president may dissolve Congress and call for new legislative elections if lawmakers fail to support a vote of confidence in the government on two distinct occasions. Given that the FP-dominated Congress had already not supported a vote of confidence in Mr Kuczynski's government in September 2017, a failure to address Mr Vizcarra's reform proposals could potentially have allowed him to dissolve the legislature. The tacit threat of dissolution forced lawmakers to acquiesce with the executive branch and expedite debate on political reforms.
Political frictions, however, persisted between the two branches of government. Lawmakers accused Mr Vizcarra of trying to muscle his bills through Congress, and the president accused lawmakers of diluting his reform proposals. Viewing this relationship as fundamentally unsustainable, on July 28th the president announced that he would present Congress with a constitutional reform bill to bring forward legislative and presidential elections by one year, to April 2020.
Mr Vizcarra's proposal for an early election is now dominating the political scene. Lawmakers are divided on whether or not it is the best way out of Peru's perpetual political stalemate. Irrespective of the merits of the proposal, The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that lawmakers will ultimately agree to bring forward the general election. As in previous occasions, Mr Vizcarra may use a vote of confidence to force a debate on his proposal. The president could also threaten his resignation, along with that of the vice-president, which would also trigger fresh elections. In this context, there are few political incentives for lawmakers to obstruct debate on the early-election proposal.
There are substantial risks to our assumptions. Given that lawmakers are barred from consecutive re-election, they may be unwilling to yield power in the short term, even if this stance has negative implications in the medium term for their party or their political future. As a result, they may continue to delay debate on the proposal, or threaten legal action if the president attempts to make an early election the subject of a vote of confidence. The recent resignation of the vice­president-Mercedes Aráoz (also a sitting lawmaker)-from the PPK congressional caucus, citing "a lack of internal democracy", also complicates matters. The rift between Mr Vizcarra and Ms Aráoz could significantly weaken the president's negotiating hand with Congress. (The latter could ascend to the presidency if Mr Vizcarra is impeached or resigns, assuming that she does not resign in solidarity with him.) However, we think that costs of derailing the early-election proposal-which has the support of more than two-thirds of the population-outweigh the benefits, and so lawmakers should allow its passage.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a centrist candidate to win the presidency in 2020. Despite the increased disillusionment with the political establishment, voter appetite for a radical candidate from the left has not particularly increased. This was made evident in the 2018 local elections, when a plurality of regional governorships and district mayoralties were won by centrist, business-friendly candidates. However, the left believes that it can capitalise on the political weakness of established right-wing parties such as FP; the two left-wing parties in Congress, Frente Amplio and Nuevo Perú, have voiced support for Mr Vizcarra's proposal to advance the general election. Although we do not believe that a left-wing candidate is likely to gain sufficient traction to win the presidency, a stronger representation of the left in the next Congress could present its own set of political challenges for the next administration.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The Vizcarra government and its successor will face the governability challenges that accompany a high level of political fragmentation. Reflecting the nature of Peru's proportional representation electoral system, no government since 2000 has come to power with a working majority in the legislature. Although this has been part of the reason that Peru's largely orthodox economic framework has held steady for multiple decades, it has also prevented successive administrations from undertaking ambitious structural reforms, such as to the labour market.
Some of the political reforms passed by the Vizcarra administration will help to address institutional deficiencies. The reform of the judicial appointment board, for instance, should help to improve the selection and functioning of the judiciary, which should translate into increased efficiency and objectivity in institutional and judicial processes, and thus greater transparency for investors. Similarly, measures to bolster political participation, regulate campaign finance and increase gender parity in Congress should also help to improve the diversity of lawmakers. Nonetheless, there will continue to be several challenges to government effectiveness, including a less than robust political culture, an ineffective bureaucracy and pervasive corruption across all levels of government.
A process of decentralising the central government's resources and powers-initiated in 2001 but largely abandoned by following governments-has been partly revived by the Vizcarra administration. Mr Vizcarra pledged increased budgetary support from the central government, as well as a reform of the mining canon (a mechanism to redistribute mining royalties to local governments), to fast-track disbursements to local social development funds. However, these measures failed to address the underlying reason that mining wealth has failed to trickle down to local communities, notably a high level of administrative corruption, and a lack of technical capacity at regional and municipal levels. Consequently, the deepening divide between national and local politics could add to the myriad existing challenges of governability.
Political outlook: Election watch
Under our baseline assumption that Mr Vizcarra's early-election bill is passed, the next presidential and legislative polls (currently scheduled for April 2021) will be held in mid-2020. Parties have yet to begin declaring their candidates for the presidency and for Congress. However, we continue to assume that a centrist candidate will be best placed to win the presidency in 2020. Despite recent disillusionment with the political establishment, the plurality of regional governorships and district mayoralties in local elections in 2018 were won by candidates who espoused pragmatic, business-friendly policies. In our view, a candidate such as Julio Guzmán, of the centrist Partido Morado, could fit the bill. Mr Guzmán was a leading contender in the 2016 presidential election until his candidacy was disqualified over a technical error in registration. However, it is still early and the lack of strong party structures facilitates the rapid ascent of personalities and political outsiders, who could yet emerge. Legislative elections are likely to produce a politically fragmented Congress, as historically has been the case in Peru. Policymaking under the prospective government will therefore still require a significant degree of cross-party consensus building.
Political outlook: International relations
Peru's major foreign-policy challenge will centre on its relationship with Venezuela. On the one hand, Peru will seek to lead the Lima Group (a transnational regional body, of which it is a founding member) in its efforts to develop a region-wide response to the rapidly growing spillover effects of the socioeconomic crisis in Venezuela. On the other hand, Peru's ability to absorb Venezuelan refugees will be limited by growing domestic concerns over the economic and security implications of mass Venezuelan immigration.
Peru will continue to support regional integration efforts, such as the Pacific Alliance (a trade pact that also includes Chile, Colombia and Mexico). Talks are ongoing to incorporate Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and Ecuador as associate members of the bloc. Members of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) have also stated a desire for greater integration with the Pacific Alliance, but we do not currently forecast any progress in 2019-23. Peru is also a member of the Andean Community, a customs union that includes Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.
Trade policy will remain a vital component of Peru's foreign policy during the forecast period. Peru already has 17 bilateral trade deals in place, covering nearly all of the world's largest economies, including Australia, Canada, China, the EU, Japan, South Korea and the US. Peru is expected to complete domestic ratification of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (an 11-nation trade pact) by 2020.

Peru will be open to trade and will have a stable macroeconomic environment
The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business rankings measure the quality and attractiveness of the investment environment in 82 of the world's largest economies, including 12 in Latin America. Peru's business environment ranking improves slightly for the 2019-23 forecast period; the country rises to 43rd globally (from 49th in 2014-18), and moves up one place, to third in the regional rankings. Peru's improved rankings owe in part to its continued macroeconomic stability, stronger policies for competition and investment, and continued strides towards expanding international trade agreements. Since the 1990s Peru has developed a solid record of macroeconomic management, which will be strengthened over the forecast period. We assume further progress in other key areas of the business environment, including policy towards enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, market opportunities and tax policy. We expect the administration of the president, Martín Vizcarra, to continue the implementation of orthodox macroeconomic policy and rules-based fiscal management. Furthermore, despite indications of rising global protectionism, Peru will maintain its openness to foreign trade and foreign investment.
However, Peru's overall improvement in both the global and regional rankings will be constrained by categories in which improvements are generally difficult and take longer to bear fruit. This is particularly the case with the labour market, where Peru remains in 11th in the regional rankings. The Vizcarra government's plan for heavy investment in infrastructure and plans for an overhaul of labour laws will be hampered by a contentious political environment, sweeping corruption probes and burdensome bureaucracy.

Macroeconomic environment will remain attractive to investors
Peru's macroeconomic performance will continue to underpin the business environment in 2019-23. Although economic growth will slow early in the forecast period amid domestic and external headwinds, at an average of 3.2% in 2019-20, it will remain above the regional average. Improved economic conditions in the latter half of the forecast period will help to produce GDP growth of 3.7% in 2019-23 on average. Inflation will average 2.6% in 2019-23, squarely within the 1-3% target band set by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank). The fiscal deficit will continue to fall, moving towards the 1% legal limit set for 2021, after which we assume that countercyclical policy will produce continued fiscal consolidation. Exports will remain strong-as will the trade surplus-as a gradual build-up of production capacity boosts mineral output, and external demand for Peru's agricultural exports remains strong. The government undertook another round of tax reform in late 2018, complemented by tax avoidance legislation in 2019, which will help to boost tax collection as a percentage of GDP. The public debt/GDP ratio will remain manageable throughout the forecast period, below the legal ceiling of 30%. Peru's reliance on raw-material exports, however, opens it to the potential for external shocks, as does its geography, which exposes it to cyclical flooding and the threat of major earthquakes. Corruption scandals and political gridlock could also impact the forecast. A proposed constitutional reform to bring forward the general election by a year, to April 2020, could also dampen investor sentiment in the near term.

Government looks to streamline regulation and promote competition
The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves during the outlook period, with Peru moving up in both the global and regional rankings. The government further strengthened the Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y la Protección de la Propiedad Intelectual (Indecopi, the competition and intellectual property rights institute), which oversees policies to foster competition and ensure intellectual property rights. The Vizcarra administration has also continued to refine concession procedures, strengthen rules for public-private partnership (PPP) projects, and introduce new policy mechanisms, such as the co-financing of private works and the establishment of project management offices (PMOs) to improve execution. Price controls were virtually eliminated in the 1990s, and it is extremely unlikely that they will be reinstated in the forecast period. The risk from distortions, created by state ownership of enterprises, is mitigated by a strict adherence to legally binding fiscal targets.
The Vizcarra administration, as well as its successor, will not make substantial changes to the approach to public companies adopted by the previous four administrations. The government will, nevertheless, move to address problematic issues in some public enterprises. In December 2018 the government published legislation to reform the indebted Banco Agropecuario (Agrobanco, one of four public financial institutions), to establish new vehicles for small farmers to restructure debts. The government will also consider options for Petroleos del Perú (Petroperú, the state oil company) to establish partnerships with the private sector to manage its faltering 100,000-barrels/day northern oil pipeline. The pipeline has become a target of protests and was disrupted six times in the first seven months of 2019.
The government will also focus on administrative simplification during the forecast period as Peru ramps up efforts for OECD accession. Legislation was approved in July 2018 to streamline the process to obtain construction certificates and register property. As a result, the average time to obtain a building permit in Peru has dropped to 122 days, compared with an average of 153.1 days in the OECD, according to the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report. However, reducing other regulatory hurdles will take time. It currently takes 24.5 days to start a business in Peru, compared with just 9.3 days in OECD countries, according to the Doing Business report.

Peru will improve the rules for foreign investment
Peru's score for policy towards foreign investment improves considerably in 2019-23, with the country moving up nine places to 21st in the global ranking, and up one place to second regionally. The improvement reflects ongoing efforts to deepen domestic capital markets, which will help to draw in foreign portfolio investment, as well as efforts to make policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) more transparent, clear and predictable. The government will maintain the broad macroeconomic policies since the early 1990s, while making changes to encourage foreign investment, especially in infrastructure and the extractive sectors. Foreign investment is protected under the constitution, as well as through a network of 15 free-trade agreements (FTAs), and 36 bilateral investment-protection and promotion agreements. Foreign investors receive the same treatment as local investors, and can enjoy most of the tax exemptions and financing options as their domestic counterparts. Risk of expropriation of foreign assets is low, and is expected to reduce further, owing to changes in regulatory standards.
The Vizcarra administration announced major new plans for several extractive sectors. In June it created a commission that will have two years to review and propose a new electricity law that will include changes to concessions, investments and power-purchasing agreements. In July the administration announced the start of a similar process to update the 1992 General Mining Law. It also announced a new effort to work with Congress to approve changes to the organic hydrocarbons law proposed in 2017, with the aim of having the reforms in place by the start of 2020. Although ongoing congressional gridlock puts these timelines in doubt, the Vizcarra administration has also taken unilateral executive action to improve regulation in some areas. In January it approved new rules for public consultations of oil and gas concessions, and in June it revamped regulations for environmental protection for projects in the electricity sector.
The Vizcarra administration plans to focus attention on the development of industrial parks and special development zones. It published implementing legislation for special development zones in August and included industrial park development in its umbrella national competition and productivity plan, which was released in July. The national strategy for industrial parks should be in place by 2020, with the first parks operating before 2025.
The investment promotion agency (ProInversión) plans to offer (through PPPs and co-financed private initiatives) 51 projects between 2019 and 2022. These projects are expected to draw in about US$9.2bn in investment. The first of these projects, a US$269m sewage-treatment system in towns around Lake Titicaca, in the south-eastern highlands, was awarded in the first half of 2019, to a Mexican consortium, Fypasa.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls is unchanged during the forecast period, but Peru falls two places globally, to 39th, and by one place regionally, to 4th, owing to improvements in other countries. Peru will retain its commitment to trade openness; more than 90% of its trade is now covered by FTAs with most of the world's largest economies. Transactions on the current and capital accounts will remain free from restrictions and the structural strength of the external position virtually eliminates the threat of exchange controls being imposed. The BCRP will continue to ease requirements on US-dollar deposits and credit from abroad, as well as intervening intermittently in the currency markets to manage liquidity and foreign-exchange inflows. The currency has been fully convertible since 1990. Peru has a tripartite tariff structure, with 70.4% of items entering tariff-free, and the remaining items paying a tariff of either 6% (20.8% of goods) or 11% (8.8% of goods).
Trade liberalisation will remain a priority in 2019-23
Trade liberalisation has remained a pillar of Peru's economic strategy since the implementation of a watershed FTA with the US in February 2009. Peru had 15 FTAs in place as of August 2018, and has signed (but not yet implemented) bilateral agreements with Australia and Guatemala. Peru also signed in March 2018 the 11-nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and is expected to ratify it in 2020. Peru has ongoing trade negotiations with India, holding five rounds of talks as of August 2019; however, given the Indian government's relatively protectionist stance, there is a high risk that the FTA could be diluted to a preferential trade agreement. Peru also began negotiations with China in early 2019 to strengthen the existing trade agreement. New chapters covering intellectual property and e-commerce will be added to the existing agreement. Peru also remains engaged in the Trade in Services Agreement, one of the world's largest potential agreements, which involves more than 50 World Trade Organisation members.
The Vizcarra administration wants Peru to become a trade hub through the development of a national logistics system that would be completed by 2030. The first phase, through to 2025, will include upgrading infrastructure to allow for the integration of the existing Callao Port with a new US$3bn port in Chancay, 100 km to the north. The plan also proposes the building of a railroad between Lima (the capital) and Ica (a port city 255 km to the south).

Reforms to the tax code will aim to reduce evasion and promote investment
Peru's score in this category improves moderately during the forecast period, moving up one place to second in the regional rankings, and up five places to 22nd in the global ranking. The improvement to the score is explained largely by changes to the tax code aimed at promoting investment, particularly through the expansion of the OxI mechanism, which allows companies to invest a percentage of their tax bill directly in infrastructure. Policies to improve the consistency and fairness of the tax system will also come into effect during the forecast period. The tax burden in Peru is not a deterrent to doing business in the country. The corporate income tax rate stands at 29.5%, while the highest marginal income tax rate is 30%-both of which are low by regional and global standards. Peru also offers investors tax-stability agreements to stimulate private investment. The government guarantees that the statutes on income tax in effect at the time of the investment contract will remain unchanged for that investment for ten years. This scheme is applicable for investments of more than US$10m in the mining and hydrocarbons sector (or US$5m in all other sectors). The tax system also offers entities a number of income tax credits and exemptions (for instance, on pre-operating expenses, interest payments and employees' health insurance premiums). Peru's score improvement is curbed by a relatively high value-added tax (VAT) rate, which stands at 18% and is unlikely to change in the forecast period. The government will continue to adjust other taxes and implement policies to eliminate exonerations and curb tax evasion and avoidance. The overall tax system will remain complex, with the time taken to prepare, file and pay taxes averaging 260 hours in Peru, compared with 159.4 hours in OECD countries, according to the World Bank's Doing Business 2019 report.
The government will regularly assess and modify the tax code to improve efficiency and to minimise economic distortions. In December 2018 the Vizcarra administration eliminated long-standing rebates on VAT and import duties for companies working in the Amazon basin, owing to criticisms that the tax breaks did not contribute to investment or development, and that the exemptions for import duties were not passed on to consumers. The government will seek to review hundreds of similar tax exonerations, which could ease its fiscal burden by as much as 2% of GDP annually.
In May the Vizcarra administration published new regulations aimed at mitigating tax avoidance. The new legislation sheds light on what uses of tax benefits-tax deductions, tax payment deferrals and tax credits-would be considered "improper". The regulations outline seven criteria that would meet such a definition. The regulations also mandate the Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y la Administración Tributaria (Sunat, the tax agency) to create a three-member committee to determine when a review of a tax-evasion offence is required.

Prudential indicators show that the banking sector remains solid
Peru's score in the financing category is unchanged during the forecast period. Its regional ranking remains the same (in second place), while its global ranking falls 11 positions to 33rd, owing to improvements in the regulatory environment in more developed countries. The regulatory framework that governs the financial sector is solid, and is likely to be strengthened in line with the Basel III framework. Although the financial sector is highly concentrated, some of the smaller banks have developed niche positions in specific types of lending. The financial sector balance sheet is strong-the non-performing loan ratio has remained relatively stable in recent years, at between 1.5% and 3%. The capital adequacy ratio is well above the legal minimum, and liquidity levels are adequate. Bank profitability is also high, with the average return on equity of the 15 banks in the financial system remaining above 18% in the past three years. We expect greater penetration of the banking sector in the forecast period, with legislation enacted in August 2018 requiring all purchases with a value greater than three tax units (one tax unit is equivalent to about US$1,250) to go through the financial system. Capital markets are shallow, but are slated to expand on the back of recent and forthcoming legislation aimed at promoting capital-market development. Peru enjoys an investment-grade credit rating, providing the state and private companies with ample channels to access financing.
The government will unveil a series of financing mechanisms for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as for small-scale farmers, to increase their presence in the financial sector and deepen financial inclusion. The state-run development bank, Cofide, will be in charge of three funds: Crecer (for SMEs), Fondo de Capital Emprendedor (for start-up capital) and Fondo para la Inclusión Financiera del Pequeño Productor Agropecuario (for small-scale farmers). The Crecer fund for SMEs is expected to start operating in December, while the other two will begin in 2021. New legislation to regulate the fintech (financial technology) sector-planned for the fourth quarter of 2019-will help to expand the financial system.
Large domestic corporations currently enjoy captive demand for their securities from three main institutional investors: the Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs, private-pension funds), insurance companies and mutual funds. A wider range of Peruvian companies (including medium-sized firms) have issued bonds, and equity financing will become more common during the forecast period. However, a weak corporate governance culture and concerns over public information disclosure will remain the major restriction to issuance of shares.
Further progress expected on stockmarket integration
The Bolsa de Valores de Lima (BVL, the Lima stock exchange) is small, albeit expanding. The BVL will continue its integration into the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (the Latin American Integrated Market)-a joint initiative of the bourses of Peru, Colombia, Chile and Mexico-to become a single unified equity and securities exchange. Harmonisation of rules has been slow, but a new "funds passport" will allow easier investment in mutual funds.

The rigid labour market will remain an area of weakness for Peru
Peru's score in the labour category improves slightly in the forecast period, but it is the weakest indicator, keeping Peru near the bottom of both the regional and global rankings for this category. Labour rigidity will continue to hamper job creation and the low quality of education has resulted in a poorly trained workforce and low productivity. As of June, around 70% of the economically active population worked in the informal sector and only a minority of workers have access to health insurance or pensions, or pay taxes. According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI, the national statistics institute), 34% of workers in Lima did not have access to healthcare or pensions as of June. Regional differences in employment quality and productivity levels are stark. In addition, labour market mismatch is high in Peru, with around 50% of workers either underqualified or overqualified for their job, according to OECD estimates. However, given the lack of active labour market policies, this is likely to remain a concern over the forecast period. One of the positives for Peru is that wages are largely market-determined; although a minimum wage is in place, it suffers from high rates of non-compliance. However, as a result, despite low rates of unionisation, there is a high incidence of strikes-the majority of which are over wages and working conditions.
The Vizcarra administration presented a two-pronged approach to labour market reform in its competitiveness and productivity plan, published in July. In order to address issues of labour market mismatch, the government will create a unique graduate monitoring system, aimed at better matching high-skilled labour market entrants with employers. The government will also create institutes of higher technical and vocational training for low-skilled labour market entrants. By contrast, the government will be much more cautious in pursuing legislation to reduce labour market rigidity. Successive governments have attempted labour reform since the early 2000s, but have had their efforts thwarted by popular protests. In this context, changes to labour regulation will focus on reducing non-wage hiring costs and formalising part-time work and work from home.

Infrastructure is set to improve but large gaps will remain
Peru's score for infrastructure improves considerably during the forecast period, moving the country up three places in the regional rankings to sixth, and six places in the global rankings, to 59th. In 2018 the Vizcarra administration managed to unlock several projects that had previously been stalled by red tape, including the US$1.3bn expansion of Lima's international airport, the US$5.4bn construction of Line 2 of the Lima Metro, and the US$600m construction of a new airport in Cusco, the principal tourist area. These projects will not be finished until nearer the latter part of the forecast period. Others will continue to be stalled for longer, including the US$7.3bn construction of a second natural-gas pipeline in the south of the country, as well as two large-scale irrigation projects: the final stage of the Chavimochic project in the north and construction of the Majes-Siguas II project in the southern Arequipa region.
Bureaucracy, corruption scandals and weak institutional capacity continue to hamper improvements in infrastructure. At end-2018 the three levels of government-municipal, regional and national-had utilised 21% of the S25.6bn (US$7.7bn) budgeted for reconstruction in 13 regions, after mass flooding during the first quarter of 2017. The inauguration of newly elected mayors and governors in January 2019 has also slowed public investment in infrastructure. Public investment was down by 6.4% from January-July 2019, compared with the same period last year; including a near-40% drop at the municipal level. Although public investment will gather pace over the forecast period, budget under-execution will remain a perennial problem, reflecting low technical capacity in the public sector and persistent mismanagement of public projects.
The government will use new models to develop infrastructure projects
The administration unveiled its new national infrastructure plan in July. This prioritises 52 projects with a combined investment value of approximately US$28bn. It is intended to help to close an infrastructure gap, which the government estimates at around US$110bn. The projects will cover six large geographical zones, but 50% of the total investment will be focused on Lima, given its population density and its importance as a commercial centre. Meeting the targets relies heavily on several different models, including PPPs and the use of PMOs. The latter was first employed in Peru for the construction of venues for the Pan American Games (a sporting competition held in Lima from the end of July through to the end of August). A British firm was hired to manage the US$1.2bn investment. The PMO model is also being used for construction of the Cusco airport. A South Korean consortium, led by Korea Airports Corporation, was selected in June to oversee the US$660m construction effort.
ProInversión announced a list of 51 infrastructure projects that it will offer in the 2019-22 period, to draw in investment of approximately US$9.2bn. Of these projects, 36% are in transport, 25% in water and sanitation, 11% in mining and energy and 10% in hospitals. The agency has concluded one process-a co-financed private investment US$269mn for a sewage treatment network in the Puno region. The government is also considering another review of its OxI mechanism, which allows companies to invest a percentage their tax bill in infrastructure. The mechanism was responsible for financing 370 projects (valued at S4bn) since its launch in 2009, to July 2019.
Railway infrastructure is set to improve during the forecast period. The government has announced plans for a light rail system connecting Lima to intermediary cities to the north and south, and another to link the northern cities of Trujillo and Piura. Peru is also working with the governments of neighbouring countries-including Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay-to begin the construction of a cargo railway that would connect Peru's southern coast with the port of Santos in Brazil. However, the project remains in the incipient stage, and construction is unlikely to finish within the forecast period.

Mobile-phone penetration will increase, but digital infrastructure will be lacking
Peru's score over forecast period improves, moving up five places in the global rankings, to 67th position, and one place in the regional rankings, to seventh. Penetration of information technology remains unequal: although 91.5% of the population has a mobile-phone connection, only 34% of households have at least one computer and a mere 36.7% of households have access to internet, according to the national statistics institute. Although the penetration of e-commerce is improving (more than doubling to 13% in the year leading up to March), it remains below the regional average.
In 2018 the state took steps to foster digital governance in the coming years. In particular, it created the new Secretaría de Gobierno Digital (Segdi, digital government office) to direct the digital affairs strategy of public institutions. The government also established regulations in December 2018, mandating that all state agencies and all levels of governments submit plans to provide e-government services by January 2020. The central government is also in the process of migrating to a single-state portal-an approach adopted by Argentina, Mexico and Uruguay-to drive economies of scale, to facilitate access to information and government services, and to improve data sharing between public institutions. Full migration to a single-state portal is expected by 2021.
Through the national competiveness and productivity plan, the Vizcarra administration will launch strategies to close Peru's wide gaps in research and development (R&D). According to statistics from UNESCO, Peru invests around 0.15% of GDP in R&D, compared with 0.36% in Chile, 0.24% in Colombia and 0.49% in Mexico, (the three countries that Peru is partnered with in the Pacific Alliance-a regional trade bloc). To address this deficiency, the administration plans to extend in 2019 a tax credit that allows companies to deduct up to 175% of investment in R&D from their tax bill. The state will also establish a new programme for researchers and a "science space" innovation centre before end-2021. Parallel to these efforts, the state is also focused on improving education at all levels, including university education. A three-year moratorium on the creation of new universities and satellite campuses began in 2018, so that spending on higher education is focused on improving existing capacity.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Policy priorities will be broadly similar under the current and prospective governments, centring on anti-graft reform, pro-competition policy, infrastructure development, modernisation of the state and fiscal consolidation. The president, Martín Vizcarra, has sought to complement institutional reform efforts with legislation to promote transparency in the public sector (through the publication of visitor records for public officials) and the private sector (by strengthening protections for whistle-blowers).
The government also seeks to improve the business environment and promote growth through the implementation of a "national competitiveness plan"-aiming to raise potential GDP growth to 4.5% by 2022-but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only modest progress on this front. Reforms will include improvements to the framework for public-private partnerships, the strengthening of skills-building programmes, digital-capacity building and the incentivisation of economic diversification. The government will also look to pass legislation to reduce high non-wage labour costs, but will make little progress on comprehensive labour reform, which is politically very sensitive.
The government will make modest advances in incentivising infrastructure investment to narrow Peru's large infrastructure gap, through legislation that expands the scope of a programme allowing companies to invest part of their tax bill in public works projects. Other policy undertakings include adapting the country's regulatory framework to OECD standards, the development of domestic financial markets and investment in digital government.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy
Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023
Government expenditure 31.3 30.5 30.1 30.0 30.0 30.0
Government revenue 29.0 28.5 28.5 29.0 29.3 29.5
Budget balance -2.3 -2.0 -1.6 -1.0 -0.7 -0.5
Government debt 25.7 26.4 26.6 25.7 24.4 23.1
The non-financial public-sector deficit will narrow from 2% of GDP in 2019 to 0.5% of GDP by 2023, as the government gradually dials down fiscal stimulus and recent tax reforms bolster public revenue. We expect that the public debt/GDP ratio will rise from 26.4% in 2019, to a high of 26.6% in 2020, before easing to 23.1% in 2023 as the fiscal deficit narrows. This level is low by regional and global standards.
Early in our forecast period, fiscal adjustment will come more from the expenditure side. The Vizcarra administration has established spending limits for ministries and state-owned agencies in a number of areas, to improve the efficiency of public expenditure. Current expenditure growth will also be contained by lower subsidies to the Fondo de Establización de Precios de Combustibles, a fuel-price stabilisation fund, owing to weaker oil prices in 2019-20. Capital spending will fall moderately as newly elected authorities in regional and municipal governments-who took office in January-take time to get up to speed on current and planned projects; a problem exacerbated by weak institutional capacity. This will take public expenditure as a percentage of GDP from 30.5% in 2019 to 30.1% in 2020. Assuming that prudent countercyclical fiscal policy is maintained, we expect public expenditure to stabilise at 30% of GDP in 2021-23.
Meanwhile, public revenue is expected to be roughly stable as a share of GDP in the initial part of our forecast period, at 28.5% in 2019-20, as a slight deceleration in economic growth offsets improved tax enforcement. Thereafter, we expect public revenue to rise incrementally to 29.5% of GDP by 2023, owing to a confluence of factors. These include: a more rapid expansion of formal-sector employment as economic growth accelerates once again; the gradual elimination of costly tax breaks, such as to companies based in Peru's Amazon regions; and other reforms undertaken by the Vizcarra administration to reduce tax avoidance, increase oversight by the tax authority and broaden the tax base.

The Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP, the central bank) operates a well-established inflation-targeting regime that has been instrumental in maintaining macroeconomic stability by increasing confidence in policymaking, containing inflation expectations and reducing pass-through from price shocks. We expect there to be strong confidence in the inflation target throughout the forecast period. The BCRP has, in recent months, maintained fairly accommodative monetary policy to support economic growth. In August it cut the policy rate by 25 basis points, to 2.5%. We expect the monetary authorities to keep the policy rate on hold at this level until 2021, given our forecast for tepid growth and weak inflationary pressures in 2019-20. Thereafter, in 2021-23 the Peruvian economy will once again be on an upswing, leading to a renewed tightening cycle. Real interest rates will remain positive throughout the forecast period, but will nonetheless remain supportive of credit growth.

Economic growth so far in 2019 has been lacklustre as a result of low public investment, output disruptions in the primary sector and subdued external demand. Although we expect sequential improvements towards the end of 2019, annual growth will nonetheless be weak at 3% (relative to its historical ten-year growth rate, averaging 4.4%). The outlook for 2020 is slightly better-owing to improved global trade growth, higher copper prices and easier global financial conditions-but political uncertainty will weigh on the investment climate, restricting growth to 3.4% in 2020. The medium-term outlook remains favourable, owing to Peru's solid macroeconomic fundamentals and gradual improvements to the business climate.
On the expenditure side, private consumption will be bolstered by improved job creation, a rise in real wages and growth in consumer credit. Private investment will grow strongly throughout most of the forecast period, but the greatest gains will come from the mining sector; non-mining investment will be slower to expand. Public investment will falter at the beginning of the forecast period, owing to delays in project execution by newly elected local governments. However, it will gradually increase as authorities get up to speed and as improvements to the public-private partnership framework helps to spur investment in construction, transport and irrigation infrastructure. The rise in fixed investment will have a multiplier effect on growth through its knock-on effects on consumption. Historically, there has been evidence to support the existence of a virtuous investment-employment-consumption cycle in Peru. The contribution of the external sector to growth will be muted throughout the forecast period as increased import demand offsets higher export volumes.
A key risk to our forecast stems from weaker than expected investment in the extractives sector. This could materialise through a number of channels. For instance, an increase in trade protectionism worldwide could dampen commodities prices, reducing the profitability of mining companies. Another risk stems from disruptions to mining activity as a result of social conflict. Despite steps by the Vizcarra administration to improve dialogue between local communities and mining companies, we do not rule out the possibility of protracted anti-mining protests.
On the supply side, although the economy will remain dominated by the mining sector, the main productivity gains will come from the agro-industrial sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years. Manufacturing will continue to face constraints related to external competition, fluctuations in global demand and a lack of skilled labour. Services growth will be supported by advances in the retail, finance, tourism and transport sectors. The continued expansion of an emerging middle class will boost the services sector.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Industry will grow by an annual average of 4.4% in 2019-23, supported by strong prices for Peru's key metals exports-particularly copper. Although copper prices have softened so far this year, amid rising trade tensions between China and the US, they will resume an upward trajectory later in our forecast period as copper stocks fall. China, which accounts for almost half of global copper consumption and is Peru's largest trade partner, will be pivotal in sustaining a tighter copper market. China's electric-vehicle market and significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure-as officials work to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions-will further help to increase copper demand. The outlook for copper consumption in India (one of Peru's fastest-growing export markets), is also broadly positive, owing to investment-led growth in that country. Although the copper-price environment will not match up with the 2006-13 boom years, it will nonetheless be supportive of investment in the extractives industry. The government calculates that mining projects, principally in copper, gold, iron ore and silver, could bring in as much as US$38bn in new investment in 2019-23. Furthermore, feasibility and engineering studies have been completed for around half of the mining projects on offer, which should consolidate the development of a new mining cycle. We expect more modest investment, as a number of projects that the government is counting on are expected to face issues related to financing or face opposition from local communities. Community groups oppose the arrival of mining investment, citing concerns over damage to the environment and the fact that not enough locals are hired to work at the mines. Anti-mining protests often turn violent and mining projects suffer delays. Nevertheless, Peru will preserve its place as a pre-eminent copper producer (it is currently the second-largest producer in the world, behind Chile) and mining output will show consistent growth.
Manufacturing will also remain fairly dynamic, despite its vulnerability to fluctuations in demand from the US and China-given their trade war-and competitiveness issues brought on by the combination of low productivity and myriad free-trade agreements (FTAs). As such, the areas that will see the most growth will be extractive or non-tradeable in nature. Significant investments in 2019-23, including in the expanding petrochemicals sector and gas-pipeline infrastructure, will boost industrial capacity in the latter part of the forecast period. Successive administrations have moved towards the medium- to long-term goal of developing industrial centres that will take advantage of the high quantity of ethane in Peruvian gas to produce polyethylene and other petrochemicals. The construction of large hydroelectric plants in the Amazon region will also boost growth in the energy sector. Construction, which has boomed in recent years, will continue to expand during the forecast period, although at a slower rate. This will be driven by the government's plans for public infrastructure projects (electrification, sanitation, housing, roads and new transport facilities in major cities), and private projects, including large retail investments in secondary cities and industrial schemes (such as a natural-gas pipeline, hydroelectric plants and mining projects).
Agriculture will record average annual growth of 4.2% in 2019-23, although the figure masks some volatility across the forecast period. Peru is carving out a niche in international markets for agro-exports, taking advantage of growing conditions at home and new opportunities created by Peru's numerous FTAs. The rapid growth of agricultural and agro-industrial activity in recent years has also led to sustained growth in formal employment; the number of new formal sector jobs created in agribusiness surged by 24% in 2018, to close to 100,000. Considerable investment in irrigation and export capacity has gone into the sector in recent years, and output will be lifted in the latter part of the forecast period by the completion of large irrigation projects in the southern and northern coastal areas. The fishing sector is expected to grow modestly, focusing largely on traditional fishmeal and fish-oil exports, as the government regulates fishing for human consumption to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks.
Services are expected to grow by an annual average of 3.5% in 2019-23, supported by an expansion in retail, finance, tourism and transport. Planned expansion of large retail chains across the capital, Lima, and in smaller cities will respond to the changing consumer patterns of a growing middle class. Tourism will gain in importance as infrastructure, such as the construction of a modern airport in Cusco that will better access to the country's main tourism destinations, improves gradually. The continued emergence of a growing middle class will boost the services sector and will gradually contribute more to Peru's GDP growth as the latest wave of investment comes to an end.

Inflationary pressures remain modest, with 12-month inflation at 2.1% in July. An expansion of the labour supply has contained wage growth, keeping demand-side pressures in check. Supply-side pressures will also be muted, owing to expected lower oil prices in 2019-20. As economic growth gathers pace in 2021-23, we expect inflation to pick up once again. We expect it to stay within the BCRP's 1-3% target range on average throughout the forecast period.

After mild depreciation in 2019-related to a general weakness of emerging-market currencies-we expect the sol to appreciate in nominal terms in 2020-23, owing to strong capital inflows. The relative attractiveness of Peruvian assets will support foreign-portfolio inflows, despite an uncertain investment climate. Foreign direct investment (FDI) will slacken slightly in 2019-20 as non-mining FDI is dampened by a challenging international environment, but we expect it to pick up in 2021-23. On this basis, we project average annual real currency appreciation of 0.7% during the forecast period, taking the sol from S3.37:US$1 at end-2018 to S3.22:US$1 at end-2023. Our forecasts assume a modicum of central bank intervention in currency markets to maintain sol competitiveness. The BCRP made purchases of US$405m in January-June to reduce appreciation pressures on the sol. Although we expect ad hoc interventions to continue, this will not produce serious currency misalignment.
The BCRP will continue to support the ongoing process of de-dollarisation and the protection of the financial sector, which is moderately exposed to currency risk. Although Peru's capital market has advanced in recent years, it remains relatively shallow, limiting the sol's exposure to emerging-market asset sell-offs.

After widening to 1.9% of GDP in 2019, the current-account deficit will narrow to 1.6% of GDP in 2020, and again to 1.4% of GDP in 2021 (at which it will stabilise for the rest of the forecast period). Commodity price shocks remain the key risk to our forecast. The trade surplus will remain large, averaging 2.6% of GDP in 2019-23. Export revenue will be supported by high copper prices and gradual improvements to productive capacities, as well as greater export-market diversification. The import bill will grow slowly in 2019-23, owing to weaker prices of oil and other intermediate goods. However, import values will grow faster from 2021 onwards, amid resurgent oil prices and greater import demand. The primary income deficit will remain large, averaging 4.7% of GDP in 2019-23, owing to profit repatriation by multinational firms in Peru. The services deficit will be roughly stable, at an average of 1% of GDP. The secondary income account (mostly inward workers' remittances) will register an average surplus of 1.5% of GDP. The current-account deficit will be more than adequately financed by inward flows of FDI, which will average 3% of GDP in 2019-23.
Foreign reserves stood at US$68.1bn on August 23rd (equivalent to about 16 months of import cover). Although reserves will rise further in nominal terms, coverage will fall to 14.5 months by 2023. Nonetheless, this will provide more than adequate protection against external shocks.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Peru
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows peaked in 2012 at a historic high of US$13.6bn (7.1% of GDP). FDI flows have since ebbed, reaching US$6.5bn in 2018 (2.9% of GDP). The initial decline in FDI was a result of weaker commodities prices, which dampened foreign investment in the mining sector. However, with metal prices up significantly from their 2015-16 lows, mining FDI has begun to recover. In this context, the sustained decline in FDI in 2017-18 related largely to the stagnation of non-mining investment, as corruption scandals and political crises put major infrastructure projects on hold during those years. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to increase moderately, in nominal terms, over the forecast period, owing to resurgent prices for Peru's traditional exports, especially copper. At the same time, strong opportunities will open up in the energy, manufacturing, retail and infrastructure sectors. However, FDI inflows will stabilise at around 3% of GDP in 2019-23, considerably below the average of 5.6% of GDP at the height of the commodities boom in 2007-12. The stock of inward FDI totalled US$106bn at end-2018, or 47.2% of GDP. Peru does not have significant outflows of FDI; these totalled only US$19m in 2018, resulting in a stock of just US$8.8bn. Despite its small size, this stock has increased sharply over the past decade.
Origin and distribution
According to the government's investment-promotion agency, ProInversión, in 2018 Spain, the UK and Chile respectively accounted for 18%, 17% and 13% of the accumulated FDI stock in Peru, followed by the US (12%), the Netherlands (6%) and Brazil (5%). The stock of FDI was dominated by the mining sector, with 22% of the total, ahead of telecommunications (19%), finance (18%), energy (13%) and industry (12%); all other sectors had low single-digit shares. This suggests that there is considerable potential outside the traditional recipient sectors, with retail, transport, and tourism considerably underrepresented compared with their shares of FDI in similar economies. One notable investment in the past resulted from the sale of the national telephone company to Telefónica (Spain), which partly explains that country's (and the telecoms sector's) large share of the FDI stock.
Determinants
Macroeconomic stability and liberalisation in the 1990s allowed for large increases in FDI inflows, following a period of sharp economic recession in the late 1980s. Annual average inflows rose from the negligible amounts of the 1980s to US$1.7bn (3.5% of GDP) in the 1990s. During the first half of the 1990s in particular, the government aggressively pursued foreign investment in privatisation, above all in communications and financial services, and the development of abundant mining and energy resources. The implementation of business-friendly policies in the early 2000s, coupled with political stability-in addition to an ongoing rise in commodity prices throughout most of the last decade-helped to boost FDI inflows to an average of US$3.7bn in 2000-10, and to an average of US$8.3bn in 2011-15. During 2019-23 the government will continue to seek to attract private investment into mining, hydroelectricity, hydrocarbons exploration and infrastructure projects. However, risks to commodities prices will persist throughout the forecast period, especially given a recent increase in protectionist sentiment across the globe, and efforts to diversify into other sectors (such as services) could prove increasingly lucrative.
Impact
Increases in FDI during the mid-1990s funded a growing share of gross fixed investment. The impact of FDI on the wider economy in terms of technology transfer has been confined mainly to the spillover effects from a much-improved telecoms sector and a more efficient financial services sector, with investment in mining having only limited links to the rest of the economy. This is changing, as foreign investment in natural gas and hydroelectricity is improving sources of energy. The award of infrastructure concessions will also promote economic development across various regions (some of which are relatively poor). An estimated US$110bn shortfall in infrastructure and communications investment will also be a driver for increased public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Potential
In the short term, increased FDI will be driven by reinvestment of profits of foreign companies amid relatively firm economic growth, as well as robust demand for Peru's mining exports. However, attracting new investment outside the mining sector will prove more challenging. Notwithstanding ongoing efforts to streamline regulation on public tenders, PPPs in infrastructure will frequently be subject to delays, given the difficulties involved in managing various stakeholders. Regardless, Peru's improving track record of prudent policymaking, free-trade agreements with the US and the EU (which include FDI clauses), and Peru's rich hydrocarbons and minerals resources will continue to pique interest during the forecast period. Nonetheless, there are numerous risks associated with foreign investment in the mining sector including bureaucratic delays, local opposition, governability concerns, difficulty with environmental licences and uncertainty associated with metals prices. Other areas that will receive investment include hydrocarbons exploration, transport infrastructure, water and sanitation, petrochemicals, and telecoms. Non-capital investment will be led by the financial and tourism sectors.

Working-age population will outstrip overall population growth
Population growth slowed to 1.1% per year in 2014-18, from 2.3% in the 1980s and 1.8% in the 1990s, owing to migration abroad and a declining birth rate. Population growth will tick up marginally in 2019-23-keeping it above the global average-reflecting high birth rates among lower-income households and advances in healthcare (leading to outcomes such as lower infant mortality). The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries. A modest rise in the old-age dependency ratio-the proportion of the population above working age-will be partly offset by a decline in the young-age dependency ratio in the medium term. Dependency ratios have also been supported by the recent influx of Venezuelan migrants into Peru. According to official estimates, more than 800,000 Venezuelan refugees have settled in Peru since end-2015, with about 92% being of working age. The number of people of working age will therefore continue to rise faster than the growth of the population as a whole, providing a demographic dividend to the economy.
As with many countries in Latin America, Peru has experienced rapid urbanisation in recent decades. According to the latest estimates from the national statistics institute, 79% of the total population lived in cities in 2017, with about two-fifths of those living in Lima, the capital. Urbanisation will continue to rise during the forecast period as Peruvians seek better living and employment conditions. Informal employment, which is estimated to account for over three-quarters of the economically active population, will remain high, notably in the construction and retail sectors. Informal unemployment is expected to decline only gradually, aided by government efforts to ease labour costs for businesses via tax simplification and subsidies, but it will remain high by international standards. The unemployment rate reached a record low of 5.9% in 2014, but has been slowly creeping up as economic growth has cooled, relative to the years of the commodities boom. Although the unemployment rate has stabilised at around 6.7% over the last three years, this masks high levels of underemployment, which affects as much as one-third of those employed, and is tied to a mismatch between labour market demands and the focus and quality of education.
Demographic indicators to improve, but from a low base
Peru's demographic indicators will make progress in the next decade-as education standards rise, nutrition improves, and access to safe water and sanitation is expanded-but they will remain relatively poor. Poverty levels have declined significantly over the last decade. The proportion of the population living in poverty fell from around 37% in 2008 to 20.5% in 2018. However, there are marked regional disparities; 42% of the population in rural areas was still living below the poverty line in 2018 (down from 68.8% in 2008). According to official figures for 2018, 85% of the urban population had access to potable water through the public network (a further 10% are served, but water is not deemed potable). Meanwhile, only 75% of the rural population is reached by the public network, and a mere 9% of those served receive potable water. The extension of the water and sanitation network will remain one of the highest public healthcare priorities, and will continue to receive substantial investment in the forecast period as the government plans significant expenditure in this area in 2019-22 through ProInversión (the state investment promotion agency).
Health status indicators have improved significantly in recent decades, although regional variations in infant and maternal mortality rates are pronounced. Average life expectancy has risen to 75.9 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO); its figures differ from the local-source data on which The Economist Intelligence Unit's current forecasts are based. According to the World Health Statistics 2018 report published by the WHO (which for Peru contains 2015 data), maternal mortality rates have more than halved over the past 15 years (from 160 to 68 per 100,000 births), but are still above the regional average of 52. The mortality rate of children under five has been on a declining trend, reaching 15.3 per 1,000 births in 2015 (down from 40 in 2000), although it remains a serious problem, especially in the more remote rural districts. The latest cause-of-death data (2014) show that malignant tumours are the single highest cause of mortality, followed by influenza and pneumonia. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes also rank high among the main sources of mortality. Our projections assume that there will be some progress in health statistics in 2019-23, but that Peru will continue to lag behind most other countries in the region.

The emerging middle class will expand, but remain concentrated in urban areas
Although the Peruvian consumer market will remain characterised largely by inequality, two decades of strong economic growth have gradually led to the emergence of a growing middle class. Over the past decade, the capital, Lima-where most affluent consumers are concentrated-has seen a rapid transformation in consumer patterns. Retail and entertainment chains have expanded from the traditional wealthy areas, owing to increasing demand from lower-income districts and emerging neighbourhoods (former slums) located in the periphery of the metropolitan area. This new consumer demand is also evident in secondary cities, such as Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Cusco, Piura, Iquitos and Ica, where economic growth has had a wider impact. However, the growth of market opportunities will remain limited to urban areas, and the majority of the population (particularly in rural areas) will continue to have low disposable income during the forecast period.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects average annual GDP growth of 3.7% in 2019-23; solid in historical terms, and an improvement over the average growth of 3.2% in 2014-18, when the economy was adjusting to the end of the last commodities supercycle. This will contribute to the continued gradual expansion of the middle class as the number of formal-sector jobs grows, albeit from a low base. The economy is expected to generate jobs for unskilled and skilled workers alike. However, those who remain in rural areas, or are confined to the informal sector by a lack of skills (where underemployment will keep the supply of labour high and crimp income), will continue to see fewer benefits.
The government's efforts to reduce labour costs-especially at small firms-could help to increase formal job creation, but despite efforts to improve educational outcomes, raising skill levels will prove challenging. Although a strengthening of existing conditional cash transfer programmes will increase purchasing power for lower-income groups, their access to consumer goods and services will remain limited. Despite a sharp reduction in overall poverty levels (from more than half the population in 2000 to less than a quarter today), indigenous communities in the Andes and the Amazon areas will remain isolated and high levels of illiteracy will persist.

Poverty and social inequality will remain barriers to market growth
Owing to still high levels of poverty and vast social inequalities, the total size of the population is a poor guide to market opportunities in Peru. The World Bank estimates the country's Gini coefficient (a widely used indicator of inequality, with zero equalling complete equality and 1 maximal inequality) at 0.433 in 2017, lower than in some other regional economies, but high by global standards. Low inflation, steady growth of real incomes and targeted poverty-alleviation programmes will gradually lift more families out of poverty, allowing the share of food in overall household expenditure to decline slowly, although it will remain high by international standards. Increased household incomes will bring about a shift in consumption patterns, with food and beverages losing ground to expenses in healthcare and telecommunications. Over time, growth of credit will encourage increased expenditure on durable consumer goods by a greater proportion of the overall population and those living outside Lima.
The market is geographically skewed, with metropolitan Lima accounting for about one-third of the population, well over 50% of all economic activity and 75% of consumer bank credit. Although Lima will continue to be the focus for investors, they will increasingly tap demand in areas outside the capital. Indeed, the last few years have seen a rapid expansion of retailers in the larger cities along the coast and in the Andes, and an expected pick-up in growth in 2019-23 will mean that this trend is likely to continue in the medium term. Greater market integration is also expected as the government continues to increase spending on infrastructure. Growth, macroeconomic stability, low tariffs and a plentiful supply of foreign exchange should allow Peru to become a more significant importer of consumer goods. This trend will be accelerated by greater access to US, Chinese and European markets under free-trade agreements. Although Peru's population is ageing, it will remain much younger than in developed markets, and the ongoing demographic boom will make consumption patterns more dynamic.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Peru's real GDP growth averaged 3.2% between 1982 and 2015, and growth of real GDP per head averaged 1.1%. However, these figures disguise a marked improvement in economic performance during the 1990s, when the policy environment was transformed, and the economy was liberalised after a period of macroeconomic instability in the 1980s, characterised by a debt crisis and hyperinflation later in the decade. These policy improvements spurred economic growth in the 2000s and helped the economy to withstand the 2008-09 global financial crisis fairly well. Although rapid GDP growth over the past two decades has enabled Peru to catch up with the Latin American median in terms of GDP per head, it is still well below that of developed countries. Weaker external conditions and slow progress in pushing the reform agenda forwards to tackle long-standing structural issues means that Peru will continue to lag behind developed economies by 2030. Peru is well endowed with natural resources-ranging from metals and natural gas to productive agricultural land. Its main weaknesses are the poor quality of its institutions, coupled with widespread income and regional inequalities. Education levels will remain low overall, and the slow pace of institutional improvement, together with lower investment in capital spending, will be the main factors behind a slowdown in average annual growth in the second half of the long-term outlook period. Opportunities in energy and mining will continue to foster investment. Nevertheless, with export-orientated industries the mainstay of the economy, Peru will remain vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and commodities prices.
Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects population growth to average 1% annually in 2019-30, before slowing to 0.57% per year in 2031-50. Fertility will decline in line with continued urbanisation, but the birth rate will remain relatively high (even by Latin American standards), and well above developed-country norms. Declining fertility and increasing life expectancy point to an ageing population. However, even by the end of the long-term forecast period, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over, at around 19%, will remain much lower than in OECD countries. Lower birth rates and the current low numbers of pensioners means that the dependency ratio (the ratio of children and elderly to the working-age population) will bottom out at 50.2% in 2020, before beginning a steady upward trend. Emigration is substantial enough to have an impact on population growth; each year, around 300,000 individuals are estimated to leave Peru to seek work abroad, although significant numbers have returned in recent years, as the economy has expanded rapidly and opportunities in traditional migrant destinations, such as Spain, have been limited. However, economic growth, by increasing disposable income for those in work, will put the option of emigration within reach of a greater proportion of the population, and the gap in economic opportunities between Peru and a variety of countries, including the US and neighbouring Chile, will remain wide. Internal migration will also have a decisive influence on the development of the economy. The level of urbanisation will rise from its present level of 79%, but it is already high by global standards, so the increase will be modest.
External conditions: The export-orientated sectors of the economy, ranging from mining to agriculture, have long been the most dynamic. Peru is expected to continue to benefit from free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US (the main market for non-traditional exports) and China, which in 2014 replaced the US as the recipient of the largest proportion of total exports. FTAs with the EU and other Asian economies will provide similar benefits. Integration efforts within Latin America are also gaining pace, particularly under the auspices of the Pacific Alliance (an integration pact comprising Peru, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), which focuses not only on trade in goods, but also on services, capital and free movement of people. Global trade flows will outpace world output growth over the long term, and Peru's increasing integration with the world economy should allow the country to benefit from global demand. Although the Peruvian economy is highly exposed to world commodity prices, its vulnerability to external shocks will be partly mitigated by greater export-market diversification, as well as investments in supply expansion of non-traditional exports (where prices have played only a marginal role).
Institutions and policy trends: Peru's institutions were weakened during the 1990s under the rule of the then president, Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000). The media and forces in Congress became co-opted by the executive, and the political system became more authoritarian. The transition from Mr Fujimori's regime highlighted popular demands for a greater degree of effective democracy and decentralisation, made evident by rising protests in Peru's regions. Nevertheless, the quality of institutions remains weak, characterised by a politicised judiciary, widespread corruption and the lack of a strong party system, which leads to legislative fragmentation. The current president, Martín Vizcarra, who has devoted much of his efforts to overhauling the political system, succeeded in passing three major constitutional reforms in 2018: a reform of the judicial appointment board, a ban on immediate re-election of lawmakers and a reform of campaign finance. Mr Vizcarra built upon these efforts in July 2019, enacting additional political reform laws addressing issues including gender parity in the legislature, the establishment of mandatory open primary elections, and the reduction of barriers to party registration. Subsequent improvements in the selection and functioning of the legislature and the judiciary should improve confidence in Peru's democratic institutions over time. Our long-term forecast assumes that improvements in the conduct of economic policy and in the policy environment will largely be sustained. We expect the public finances to be prudently managed, characterised by low debt levels. Bureaucracy will gradually be reduced and the business environment, which in some respects remains non-conducive to entrepreneurship, will improve. Increased spending on healthcare and education will gradually have productivity-enhancing effects. Private investment will lead to improvements in infrastructure. Furthermore, a continued commitment to inflation targeting by the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (the central bank), along with responsible fiscal management and a low debt stock, will help to maintain macroeconomic stability, while a flexible exchange rate will help the economy to cope with external shocks.
Long-term performance: We forecast average real GDP growth of 3.4% per year in 2021-30, easing to an average of 3% in 2031-50; this is strong by regional standards. Past reforms-in particular the establishment of private pension funds-will continue to bear fruit, helping to deepen capital markets and raise the savings rate. Nevertheless, growth is likely to be focused on resource-intensive areas, export agriculture and specialised areas of manufacturing, such as textiles. Relatively low levels of education for the majority, coupled with low spending on research and development-at less than 1% of GDP-will constrain the economy from moving into higher value-added areas, despite frequent attempts by governments to improve domestic productive capacity. Economic performance will become more dependent on productivity gains as growth in the labour force slows and the economy remains reliant on the extractive sectors. Reflecting investments made in previous years and slow but sustained institutional improvements, labour productivity will rise by an average of 2.6% in 2019-50. We expect GDP per head, measured at purchasing-power parity levels, to increase to 28% of the US level by 2050, up from 20% in 2018.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Peru's long coastline and diverse topography leave it disproportionately exposed to the effects of climate change. It is already a warm country, given its tropical latitude, and is therefore subject to droughts and extreme weather events. Peru is further disadvantaged by the fact that more than two-thirds of the population, and most of its economic activity, is concentrated along the Pacific coast. These risks are exacerbated by Peru's economic structure; although the agricultural sector makes up only 7.5% of GDP, it accounts for nearly 30% of total employment. Furthermore, Peru is heavily reliant on agro-industrial production for its export economy, which is crucial to the health of its external accounts. Therefore, even though Peru is responsible for close to 0.1% of global carbon-dioxide emissions, it will be one of the most responsive countries in terms of implementing policy for climate change adaptation.
In April 2018 Peru became the fourth country in the Latin American and Caribbean region to institute a legal framework for climate change mitigation, in line with the commitments of the Paris Agreement (ratified by Peru in mid-2016). One of the key implications of the law is that it makes Peru's commitment to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 30% by 2030, legally binding. These efforts will largely be focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the Amazon region, which is responsible for the majority of greenhouse-gas emissions in Peru. The framework also seeks to promote research in climate change management, by making it a priority area for public spending. Climate financing rose exponentially, from US$400,000 in 2005 to US$426m in 2015, and will continue on a positive trajectory over the long term. This year we have developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Peruvian economy will be 4.2% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments
Peru's government is seeking to promote the development of new technology, both by introducing it into government services and by encouraging partnerships with the private sector. The government is working on developing a comprehensive regulatory framework aimed at encouraging investment into the growing industry by reducing regulatory uncertainty for investors. This should therefore reduce the risk of bringing new technological developments to market.
In 2012 the Peruvian government approved law 29985, on electronic money (e-money), which proved to be one of the fundamental pieces of legislation for enabling the growth of electronic-commerce (e-commerce) and mobile-commerce (m-commerce). The law allows banks and non-banking financial institutions to issue and clearly define e-money, and facilitate its use by existing companies and new start-ups.
As a result, overall e-commerce usage is increasing, driven by rising internet use by the young population, with an internet usage rate of 83% among persons aged 19-24 years. The m-commerce sector is developing particularly quickly, owing largely to greater mobile-internet coverage than wired-internet coverage, particularly in remote and rural areas. Mobile-phone penetration in Peru is high, at 91.5% in early-2019, and this is expected to increase further in the coming years. The expanding availability of third-generation (3G) and fourth-generation (4G) services will also be supportive of m-commerce expansion.
An example of innovative products using the new technology is mobile-money wallets, which have facilitated the growth of m-commerce. The government has led innovation in this space by partnering with financial institutions, telecommunications companies, microfinance institutions and other providers to offer Billetera Móvil (BiM)-the country's first fully operational national mobile-money system. This has encouraged private investors to join the scheme and offer their own m-commerce services.
Nonetheless, despite relatively low transaction costs for services such as BiM, the cost of buying a mobile phone handset is still high for some sectors, acting as a barrier to entry. For instance, mobile ownership costs 12% of total income for the poorest 40% of Peru's population, well above the industry target of 5% of total income. In addition, efforts to broaden financial inclusion will be impeded by high levels of financial illiteracy and a lack of confidence in the financial system (related to inadequate consumer-protection requirements). For logistical reasons such as these, e-commerce and m-commerce services are likely to expand most rapidly in urban areas, with take-up of new tech services being slower in Peru's most remote areas.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Egypt--highlights: Political outlook
Egypt's political sphere will remain tightly controlled during the forecast period, reflecting the government's wariness of dissent in the delicate security and economic environment. Nevertheless, the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will maintain internal stability during his second term, which has been extended to 2024 as part of a package of constitutional amendments that were approved in early 2019. There is also a special dispensation for Mr Sisi to stand for a third term. All forms of protest activity will continue to be heavily repressed. The security forces will face persistent challenges from armed Islamist groups, both in northern Sinai, as part of an ongoing insurgency, and also in the form of sporadic terrorist incidents elsewhere in the country.

Egypt's business environment score improves in the forecast period, with its regional and global rankings rising by one and seven places, respectively, owing largely to better macroeconomic conditions and efforts to enhance the business environment. The government passed a new investment law in 2017 with further refinements in 2019 and a new law on industrial licensing, in an effort to ease crippling levels of red tape and to boost incentives for private enterprise. Consequently, there is a leap in the score for policy towards private enterprise and competition. Nonetheless, progress will be slow in certain areas owing to resistance from vested interest groups in the government and military.

Although it was formally concluded in mid-2019, Egypt remains broadly committed to the strictures of the economic reform agreement concluded with the IMF in 2016, which helped to secure significant external funding, including a US$12bn loan from the Fund. Economic reform will remain focused on fiscal and structural deficiencies, with a view to consolidating the state finances, shoring up foreign reserves and enhancing the business environment. The Economist Intelligence Unit, therefore, expects the fiscal and current-account deficits to narrow, albeit gradually. The most severe macroeconomic imbalance precipitated by the (managed) flotation of the pound in 2016 is high inflation, although this is now returning to the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) comfort zone of single digits. More broadly, macroeconomic stability will be achieved slowly over 2019-23, spreading to the private sector gradually, reflecting weak institutional capacity.

Egypt will enjoy a structural demographic bonus in 2019-23, when it will experience an increase in its working-age population, and the country will retain its standing as host to the largest population in the Middle East. This will present both a demographic opportunity, owing to the presence of a sizeable, youthful workforce, and a demographic challenge if the current downwards trend in unemployment is not sustained (not our central forecast). Regardless, the spike in the cost of living since the currency flotation means that many young Egyptians will continue to seek employment in the Gulf states and elsewhere. Egypt is highly urbanised, with nearly one-tenth of the population living in Cairo.

In population terms, Egypt boasts the largest consumer market in the Middle East and North Africa. However, the potential of this market will be severely constrained in the first half of the forecast period by weak purchasing power, reflecting low wage growth amid high (albeit easing) inflation, with consumers wary of spending amid subsidy reform and recent economic instability. GDP per head figures mask deep income disparities between the rich and the poor, with most of the population in the latter category. Nevertheless, per-capita income will begin to pick up steadily in 2019-23, including in US dollar terms.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Egypt has started to address long-standing market distortions, and there is significant potential for strong real economic growth in the long term. However, success will also depend on a commitment to structural reform, as well as on major improvements to institutional effectiveness. We forecast that real GDP growth will average 3.5% a year in 2019-30 and 2.9% in 2019-50, with labour productivity growth being a significant contributor.

Background: In 1952 an army coup brought an end to the monarchy in Egypt. Two years later Gamal Abdel Nasser (1954-70), a former military officer, assumed the presidency and introduced nationalist policies. Under his successor, Anwar Sadat (1970-81), Egypt's political stance shifted towards the west and its economic policies became more liberal. Mr Sadat's signing in 1979 of a peace treaty with Israel eventually led to his assassination and the appointment of his deputy, Hosni Mubarak, as president in 1981. However, Mr Mubarak grew increasingly unpopular among Egyptians as official corruption became rampant during his three-decade tenure, and a popular uprising, backed by the military, forced his resignation in early 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood, which had been banned since 1954, won parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012. However, in the wake of mass protests, it was ousted by the military in July 2013, and the former army chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president by a landslide less than a year later and re-elected in 2018.
Political structure: Egypt's semi-presidential system is based on the 2014 constitution, which granted parliament wider powers, including the right to withdraw confidence from the president. However, the current parliament-elected in late 2015-lacks an effective opposition bloc. In April 2019 the constitution was amended to extend the presidential term and strengthen the powers of the office-including over parliament, the judiciary and military. Cabinet ministers are often subjected to scrutiny, which can result in their dismissal and, in some cases, court action.
Policy issues: Weak institutional capacity and stiff opposition from interest groups-chiefly employees in the state bureaucracy-often prevent economic reforms. Nonetheless, the Sisi regime is keen to enhance the business environment and consolidate the public finances through fiscal reforms.
Taxation: After multiple revisions, a presidential decree was passed in August 2015 reducing the top tax rate on companies and individuals from 25% to 22.5% on incomes of E£200,000 (US$22,523 at the pre-flotation official rate) or above. The decree also suspended a 10% capital gains tax for two years, to boost competitiveness. However, it retained a 10% tax on stock dividends. Value-added tax (VAT) of 13% was approved by parliament in August 2016 and raised to 14% in 2017/18.
Foreign trade: Egypt has a large structural trade deficit, which widened in 2018, to US$37.8bn. Despite declining hydrocarbons output, oil and gas remain the country's leading export earners. Suez Canal transit fees provide more than US$5bn a year in foreign-currency inflow, and the current account fluctuates between modest deficits and surpluses.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, won a second four-year term in March 2018; the present government took office in June that year, with Mustafa Madbouly replacing Sherif Ismail as prime minister. The only significant change during the following 12 months after the presidential election was the replacement of the transport minister following a train disaster in February. Domestic policy will remain largely focused on economic and social reform, but in the context of tightly controlled political process. Among the key ministers is Sahar Nasr, whose portfolio has expanded over time to include investment as well as international co-operation. (Ms Nasr was instrumental in securing a three-year US$12bn loan from the IMF in August 2016 and further funding from the World Bank.) Other key figures include the finance minister, Mohamed Maait, the foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, and the defence minister, Mohammed Zaki.
The cabinet is largely technocratic in nature, which partly reflects the embryonic status of most political parties in Egypt and Mr Sisi's desire to contain alternative power bases. This may also reflect Mr Sisi's desire to remain neutral towards all political forces that are currently represented in parliament. Many cabinet ministers are Western-educated, and most are private-sector veterans without affiliations to political parties. The president has taken steps to boost the representation of Copts and women in the cabinet (evidenced by the rise of Ms Nasr), with some holding key posts. Although former members of the now defunct National Democratic Party are rarely selected for ministerial posts, many of the lower-ranking officials in the government served under the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak (1981-2011).
The armed forces and their various affiliates have assumed an increasingly important role in the economy during Mr Sisi's rule, and particularly in infrastructure projects. This trend is likely to be reinforced during the forecast period. One of the most important figures in the cabinet is the new transport minister, Kamel el-Wazir, who was head of the Egyptian Armed Forces Engineering Agency prior to his appointment in March 2019. Mr el-Wazir has been given a mandate to effect a major upgrade to the railway system.
Parliamentary forces: Elections to the 596-member unicameral legislature concluded in December 2015, with pro-state parties claiming the lion's share of parliamentary seats. These include the Free Egyptians party (65 seats), the Nation's Future party (53 seats) and the decades-old Wafd party (36 seats), all of which have secular and nationalist inclinations. Mr Sisi did not form his own party to contest the election, but most of the represented factions are broadly supportive of his domestic political and economic policies. Many of the Mubarak-era loyalists who ran as independents or under the Egyptian Front coalition failed to win seats, although the success of a sizeable number of businessmen will give lobby groups a powerful voice inside the assembly. Similarly, the Salafi Nour party suffered a heavy defeat with only 11 seats, in an indication of dwindling public support for Islamists. Almost all of Egypt's existing political parties are newly founded, and all of them lack a popular and nationwide base of support. With the notable exception of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, most of the other parties represented in parliament backed the candidacy of Mr Sisi in the 2018 presidential election. It is worth noting that Mr Sisi is not a member of a political party himself. The 2019 constitutional amendments will reduce the number of seats in the lower house to 450 from 596, and one-quarter of its seats will be reserved for women. An upper house, the Senate, will be created, with 180 members, of whom two-thirds will be elected and the remainder appointed by the president. The Senate will be consulted on a wide range of policy matters. The move is clearly aimed at further tightening the president's oversight of the legislative branch.
Political outlook: Political stability
The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will remain in power over the 2019-23 forecast period and beyond. Constitutional amendments ratified in April 2019 extend his current, second term from four to six years, to 2024. They also allow him to stand for a further six-year term, until 2030, and tighten his control over other branches of power in several key ways: the creation of the office of vice-president; changes to the structure of parliament-including establishing an upper house (Senate), in which one-third of members will be appointed by the president; direct presidential oversight of judicial appointments; and an expanded role for the military. Although Mr Sisi will keep a tight grip on power, crack down on public dissent and contain social instability, the centralisation of the president's authority and the extension of his term pose risks to political stability beyond 2019-23, especially if the public do not begin to see substantial benefits from economic reform. The overthrow of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, during the 2011 Arab Spring, and the recent ousting of the presidents of Sudan and Algeria, illustrate the potential risks to long-serving authoritarian regimes. Mr Sisi, formerly the head of the armed forces, will ensure that he continues to retain the support of the military, including by allowing it to expand its business interests as a means by which to ensure regime stability in the medium term.
The risk of occasional protests will continue, especially as tough economic reforms have only recently started to translate into broader economic growth and lower unemployment. Public distaste for further instability is likely to keep such pressures muted, but continued political repression could undermine Mr Sisi's rule in the longer term. Domestic policies will focus on economic development, particularly in the restive Sinai and other deprived areas, and security. Mr Sisi will exert even tighter control over the military and internal security, taking a tough line on dissent, media freedoms and security threats, with ongoing harsh crackdowns on Islamist militants.
Although he has made some concessions under international pressure on the rights of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Mr Sisi will retain tight control over political discourse and civil society groups. Parliament-dominated by the Support Egypt bloc-is subservient and will be further kept in check by presidential appointees to the new Senate. The most active opposition to the government will remain Sinai-based jihadi groups, as well as the deposed Muslim Brotherhood and its militant offshoots Hassm and Liwa al-Thawra. The last two groups have carried out attacks on state and security officials and on tourist sites since the removal in July 2013 of the Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi. Public sympathy for the Brotherhood has ebbed, however, amid concerns over the instability that forceful regime change would entail and the prospect of a robust security response.
The sweeping anti-terrorism offensive launched in February 2018 has inflicted severe damage on terrorist infrastructure and has helped to restore the fortunes of Egypt's vital tourism sector, but sporadic attacks will remain a threat. Although eradicating terrorism is unrealistic, given broader regional turmoil, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the military operation will help contain the number and size of attacks. Nonetheless, there is still a considerable risk from jihadi groups, which will carry out attacks intermittently on tourist areas, as well as on military and minority religious targets.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Egypt's bureaucracy is arguably the largest in the region-and among the most bloated globally-with nearly 6m workers employed by the central government, according to official data. (This excludes around 3m additional workers who are employed by the state on temporary contracts.) As a result, low efficiency is particularly endemic in the government sector. This over-staffing has placed a heavy burden on the public finances and left few funds for improving public services and upgrading systems. Domestic reform is sometimes held back by the populist bent of the parliament, although it has co-operated strongly with the state on a raft of austerity measures that have helped to unlock significant multilateral financial support, such as a US$12bn credit facility from the IMF.
Mr Sisi has professed his determination to make the government more efficient and to crack down on corruption. In the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index compiled by Transparency International, Egypt's score and rank improved, placing it 105th out of the 180 countries surveyed. The main grounds for the rise in the ranking appeared to be the anti-corruption mission assigned to the Administrative Control Authority. This body is closely tied to the presidency, and, according to a law passed in 2017, its scope is restricted to the civilian bureaucracy, which means that there is no institutional structure for scrutinising the expanding military role in the economy.
However, one of the main means of achieving this has been to enhance the role of the armed forces and the intelligence services in managing important projects and in controlling services such as the media. The prerogatives of the military were strengthened in the constitutional amendments that were approved in April 2019. These amendments also reinforced the presidency's control over the judiciary (and over military appointments). Moreover, Transparency International qualified this rise in the ranking by observing that very few improvements were evident on the ground. The tightening of restrictions on public expression has also hit civil society organisations, which are heavily constrained. The increasing centralisation of power within the presidential office and among senior military and intelligence figures is likely to yield some improvements in the efficiency of government operations, but at the expense of accountability and at the risk of fostering corruption within these privileged echelons of the state.
Another important development during the forecast period will be the transfer of government operations from Cairo to the new administrative capital, to the east. Ministries are scheduled to commence this process during 2020. The move provides an opportunity to streamline government operations through having a dedicated zone for them, with modern infrastructure and information technology services. However, there will inevitably be some disruption during the transfer.
Political outlook: Election watch
Mr Sisi has not allowed alternative political leadership to emerge-only one pro-Sisi candidate was allowed to stand in the March 2018 election-and recent constitutional and other legal changes are intended to quell the development of rival power bases. This carries a risk of sudden and volatile regime change beyond the forecast period. In the medium term, however, Mr Sisi will maintain a tight grip, with parliamentary elections (due in late 2020) likely once again to see low voter turnout. The constitutional changes also extend Mr Sisi's second presidential term from four to six years, until 2024, and allow him to stand for an additional six-year term (after which the presidential mandate will be limited to two six-year terms). Mr Sisi-who is 64 and appears to be in relatively good health-is therefore likely to remain in power until 2030. Repeatedly delayed municipal elections (due in July) are likely to take place in early 2020 instead. These are particularly important for companies, as local councils will implement Egypt's new, streamlined investment regulations at municipal level. We expect the central government to ensure that only candidates who are broadly supportive of the president's agenda are allowed to contest the elections.
Political outlook: International relations
The government's priorities will remain centred on maintaining cordial ties with the US and the EU, and building a broadening range of international links, including deepening relationships with Russia and China. It will also seek to secure maximum economic support from the Gulf Arab states and build economic ties with regional allies. We expect Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to maintain close ties and increase joint efforts against security threats from Islamist groups and in the Red Sea, and over Libya, although regional policy priorities will not always match exactly. In mid-2017 Egypt joined its Gulf Arab allies-Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain-in a diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar, in protest at Qatar's support for Islamists and its close relations with Iran. The boycott will remain in place, and relations between Egypt and Qatar will remain tense throughout 2019-23, although there will be some co-ordination over Gaza, where both governments are involved in peace and reconstruction efforts.
Relations with European and Asian suppliers of military hardware will remain a priority in the context of Egypt's security campaigns and geopolitical tensions in the gas-rich Eastern Mediterranean region, where Egypt is taking an increasingly central role in developing the resource. Since the discovery of major offshore natural gas reserves in 2015, Egypt has procured European defence systems and submarines to guard its gas infrastructure and to deter incursions by Turkey, which does not recognise the 2003 maritime border demarcation agreement between Egypt and Cyprus. Co-ordination with both Cyprus and Israel over gas resources will continue to build.
The development of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam by Ethiopia will severely constrain the flow of water from the Blue Nile to Egypt. Although efforts to find a negotiated solution will intensify, tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia could flare up and affect ties between Egypt and other African nations that are politically aligned with Ethiopia. However, we expect Egypt to press its case through diplomacy and do not expect a military escalation. More broadly, Egypt will seek to strengthen diplomatic and commercial ties in Africa.

Policy reforms will continue to enhance Egypt's business environment
Egypt's overall score improves in the forecast period (2019-23), and its regional and global rankings rise by one and seven places, respectively, owing to more stable political conditions, improved macroeconomic indicators and efforts to enhance the business environment as part of reforms that have been undertaken with the support of the IMF and the World Bank. The government of Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi will build on the stabilisation of the economy achieved during his first term. His current term has been extended to a six-year mandate, and he can now stand for a third term in 2024. The economy is set to grow at a faster rate in 2019-23, and business will also welcome indications that inflation is set to stabilise at a single-digit rate, which will open the way for lower interest rates and a revival of consumer demand in the latter half of the forecast period. Structural reforms will include efforts to upgrade the education system so as to equip the new generation of workers with the kind of skills that employers are seeking.
Egypt's score for taxation improves significantly, as businesses stand to benefit from the government's enhanced management of tax affairs. The Ministry of Finance is proceeding with plans to achieve full digitisation of its tax accounts, which should improve the efficiency of tax affairs and provide greater transparency. The top rate of corporate income tax is likely to remain at 22.5%, although there is a chance that it could be lowered in the second half of the forecast period. Value-added tax (VAT) was introduced at 13% in mid-2016 (rising to 14% in July 2017), replacing the 10% sales tax. Stamp duty on share transactions was introduced in July 2017 as an interim measure until the law on capital gains tax is put into effect in 2020. Businesses setting up projects on the basis of the 2017 investment law are entitled to income tax discounts of 30-50%. Following an amendment to this law in 2019, these discounts will now be available for extensions of existing projects.
The restoration of such tax incentives, which were withdrawn in 2005, will improve Egypt's competitiveness in relation to other regional investment destinations. Access to finance will be much improved, as companies will have much less difficulty in securing foreign exchange, and the increase in the government's external borrowing will free up more domestic bank liquidity for lending to the private sector. As inflation started to ease in early 2018, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) started an easing cycle, with four rate cuts totalling 450 basis points by August 2019. Further rate cuts are likely during the first past of the forecast period.

Private consumption growth is set to recover strongly in the forecast period
The macroeconomic category was one of the weakest areas of Egypt's business environment in 2014-18, but has strengthened markedly. This reflects improvements in most key indicators, including real GDP growth, fiscal deficit, external balance and inflation, as a result of reforms enacted since 2016. Set against this are a number of challenges and risk factors, in particular weak consumer demand and high levels of both domestic and external debt.
Real GDP growth has been supported by increased investment, stronger trade performance and a substantial rise in natural gas production. However, private consumption growth has been constrained by the surge in inflation in the wake of the late-2016 flotation of the local currency, which has dampened household spending. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects further moderation in inflation and the exchange rate appears set for a period of stability.
In 2017/18 the government achieved its first primary fiscal surplus in more than a decade, which will help to bring down public debt towards the government's medium-term target of below 80% of GDP.
The flotation of the currency at the end of 2016 was a shock to the country's financial system, but it has contributed to a turnaround in Egypt's balance-of-payments position. The inflow of capital in the form of loans from international institutions, sovereign bond issues and a revival in direct and indirect foreign investment has enabled the central bank to rebuild its foreign-exchange reserves to a comfortable level, and to relax capital controls. Businesses are benefiting from much-improved access to foreign exchange.

Egypt's policy towards private enterprise and competition is likely to improve considerably over the forecast period, as the government seeks to streamline the regulatory system for investment and licensing. The country's score improves markedly and its global and regional rank both rise as a result. Most areas will see improvement. However, private businesses will have to contend with the growing involvement of the armed forces and their various commercial arms in a wide range of economic sectors.
Broadening role of military in economy could pose challenges
Efforts to promote private investment stretch back decades, but businesses still encounter a host of obstacles arising from inconsistencies in the legislation and inefficiency and corruption in the bureaucracy. The new licensing and investment laws are likely to result in some improvements, but much will depend on how they are implemented. One of the most important factors is the active role that military agencies play in business. The army frequently acts in the guise of a regulatory agency itself, by requiring permission for companies to operate in areas deemed to have a national security dimension, and military companies often compete with civilian firms, but with the advantage of being able to use cheap military assets, including land and labour. The IMF noted in its January 2018 review of its loan programme that "private-sector development may be hindered by involvement of entities under the Ministry of Defence".
Law 15 on industrial licensing and Law 72 on investment, both passed in 2017, aspire to speed up the approval processes for private companies carrying out new projects and to enhance the authority of the quasi-autonomous agencies operating under the law: the Industrial Development Agency and the General Authority for Investment.
New legislation to encourage both new and existing projects attract investment
A revision in 2019 to Law 72 now enables the expansion of existing investment projects to qualify for incentives. In the original law, these incentives were only available for new projects. The incentives include corporate tax discounts of 50% for projects in designated priority areas and 30% for projects in other areas. Another adjustment specifies that the fee for certifying signatures for contracts to set up a new project should be 0.25% of the paid-up capital, with an upper limit of E£10,000 (US$570; there was no upper limit previously).
The establishment at the end of 2015 of SCZone, an agency responsible for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, was also intended as a signal to private business that the government was serious about creating a more user-friendly regulatory environment, but it has since become more closely tied to the state sector and the armed forces
The retirement of Vice-Admiral Mohab Mamish as chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), the public-sector agency in charge of overseeing the canal, has paved the way for the agency responsible for economic development in the canal zone to regain its autonomy. Yehia Zaki, the former head of an engineering consultancy that has worked closely with the military, has been appointed chairman of SCZone The appointment of Mr Zaki is likely to be welcomed by investors, as it should enable the agency to operate more smoothly, now that its head will not have to combine this task with that of running the Suez Canal
The government has previously sought to assist domestic steel and cotton producers in the face of global pressures. Despite changes to reform competition policy, loopholes and other impediments to competition remain in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and utilities, and corruption is still a problem, especially at local government level.

Wider hard-currency availability should facilitate foreign direct investment
Egypt's score for its foreign investment policies improves for the forecast period and its global and regional rankings rise by seven and three places, respectively to 65th and 11th. The government is actively courting foreign investment through revamping the regulatory framework, including the restoration of tax incentives, and through the intensive promotion of new project proposals and zones. Foreign investors have also been encouraged by the reforms to the exchange-rate system, which have helped to ease blockages in access to foreign exchange needed to finance imports of equipment and materials and to allow for repatriation of dividends. Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) decreased slightly in both 2017 and 2018, but this was in the context of a general global slowdown in FDI, and the government claims that Egypt's share of global FDI has increased by 4% per year over this period.
The new investment law of 2017 and the subsequent amendments in 2019 have given new powers to the General Authority for Investment, with the provision for electronic approval of project proposals. The main issues the new law has sought to address are inconsistencies in the approval process and the demand from investors for the restoration of tax incentives, which were removed in 2005 on the grounds that they led to manipulative behaviour by businesses and that they deprived the Treasury of revenue.
The efficacy of a new investments approval system will now be put to the test, and businesses setting up new projects or expanding existing ones will be entitled to claim discounts of 30-50% on their tax bills, up to the equivalent of 85% of their paid-in capital. The higher discounts will be available for projects established in areas classified as deprived and for labour-intensive projects. At the insistence of parliament, the new law allows for the creation of new special investment zones (SEZs).
New legislation allows foreign acquisitions to be included in FDI figures
The investment law was amended in 2019 to enable extensions to existing projects and the development of new product lines to benefit from the tax exemptions. The amendments also included changes to the accounting system for FDI, through giving the General Authority for Investment full authority to record inflows. The definition of FDI has been broadened to reflect international practices, including allowing foreign acquisitions of stakes of less than 10% in Egyptian entities to be recorded as FDI-a notable example is the 9% foreign shareholding in Commercial International Bank, Egypt's largest private bank. Foreign oil companies will be able to retain profits for reinvestment. Regularising the recording of flows with international norms will improve transparency, and the authorities hope that it will make for a more amenable FDI environment, especially outside of the hydrocarbons sector.
The government has provided assurances that the new investment law will bring an end to conflicts with the industrial licensing law, which also includes a streamlined approvals process. It remains doubtful whether such conflicts can be avoided in practice.

Foreign trade and exchange controls will ease in 2018-22
Egypt's score in this category improves, and its global and regional rankings rise by two places and one place, respectively. This reflects the positive impact of the easing of foreign-exchange controls, which is offset by the persistent difficulties that companies face in dealing with Egypt's import and export procedures. Since 1994 there have been no explicit exchange controls in Egypt, with no officially declared restrictions on foreign investors converting currency or remitting profits and capital. Egypt has also accepted the obligations of sections 2, 3 and 4 of Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of Agreement. These oblige the authorities to refrain from imposing any restrictions on payments and transfers for current-account transactions or from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple-currency practices without the IMF's approval. Nevertheless, the authorities did impose a series of restrictions on foreign-exchange transfers after the rapid depletion of net international reserves in the wake of the 2011 revolution, and companies found it increasingly difficult to secure access to foreign exchange to finance imports and for the repatriation of dividends. The situation has improved dramatically following the flotation of the Egyptian pound in November 2016. Restrictions on cash deposits to finance imports were relaxed, and in June 2017 the central bank said that henceforth banks would be free to provide clients with foreign currency to transfer abroad, with no limit on the amount or the timeframe, removing previous restrictions placed in early 2011 and only partially relaxed in 2014 that still limited banks to one transfer per year of up to US$100,000 on behalf of individual clients.
The net international reserves of the central bank reached a record level of U$44bn in July 2018, having more than doubled since the currency's flotation in 2016, and they have since stabilised at around this level. The exchange-rate system is now operated by commercial banks, with the central bank playing no formal role in the market. The rate averaged about E£17.8:US$1 during 2017, compared with the pre-flotation official rate of E£8.88:US$1. The rate weakened slightly in the second half of 2018, amid heavy divestment by portfolio investors, but the Egyptian pound has rallied strongly in 2019 in response to renewed portfolio inflows. The currency was trading at about E£16.55:US$1 in August.
The new open foreign-exchange regime was tested in 2018 as higher interest rates in the US limited the appetite of portfolio investors for emerging markets, including Egypt. The market coped well with this test, and the CBE now has more leeway to ease monetary policy as the US authorities are poised to cut rates. The government is due to pay back about US$17bn in deposits, placed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, over the next three to four years, but these facilities could be rolled over. The first repayments of the US$12bn IMF extended facility are scheduled to start in 2021, with the final repayment due in 2026. These repayments could put additional pressure on external financing capacity if positive financial market sentiment reverses and portfolio inflows come under strain, placing pressure on the currency.

Tax policy will improve but an element of unpredictability remains
Tax policy is likely to see some improvement during the forecast period, although the scale of change will not be at the rate seen in the historical period. Egypt's global and regional rankings improve by 14 and two places, respectively. The basic rate of income tax for companies was lowered to 22.5% from 25% in 2015. The government is unlikely to increase this rate during the forecast period, and there is a chance that it could lower it to 20%, the rate it applied between 2004 and 2011, in response to lobbying from the business community, which is strongly represented in parliament. Any cut in the VAT rate is unlikely, and the government may decide to increase it from 14% to 15% as a means by which to derive more tax revenue. Withholding tax is likely to remain at its current level of 20%. Following the flotation of the local currency, international banks resumed investments in Egyptian Treasury bills as the high returns and reduced foreign-exchange risk offset reservations about the withholding tax. These inflows turned into outflows in 2018 amid a cooling of international investor sentiment towards emerging markets, but recovered strongly in 2019.
The new investment law includes a provision for tax discounts of 50% for projects in priority areas and 30% for all other projects. The law was amended in 2019 to extend these exemptions to expansions of existing projects and the launch of new product lines.
Some tax measures have been deferred
A 10% capital gains tax and a similar level of tax on annual portfolio profits, passed in 2014, have been deferred several times. The tax was supposed to be applied in May 2015, but the government granted a deferral of two years. In early 2017 the government granted a further three-year deferral but decided to introduce stamp duty on listed and unlisted securities in the interim. The duty has been set at 0.125% for the first year, rising to 0.15% in the second and to 0.175% in the third year. A charge of 0.3% will be levied from both sides in acquisitions in which one-third or more of a company's equity is sold.
The new property tax law finally came into effect in 2014/15, but the first payments did not start until 2017/18. The 10% tax is charged on properties with a market value of E£2m (US$118,000) or more. The amendments include exemptions for clubs, tourist facilities and property owned by the armed forces. Valuations are to be reassessed every five years. The first reassessment has been put back to 2020 in light of the delays in collecting the tax.

Confidence in the financial system has grown strongly
The turnaround in Egypt's balance of payments that followed the signing of a US$12bn three-year extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF in November 2016 is the main factor behind the dramatic improvement in the score and ranking for the country in the financing category. The global rank for financing rises to 46th place, and compares with a previous ranking of 68th, which reflected the acute financial constraints with which the government and business had to grapple before the IMF deal. The regional rank moves up to 6th from 12th.
The increased confidence in the international financial system in Egypt has been reflected in the series of successful sovereign debt issues undertaken by the finance ministry since January 2017, which have raised a total of US$19.7bn. The most recent were issues of US$4bn and EUR2bn (US$2.2bn), respectively, in January and April 2019. This borrowing and the loans secured from the IMF are being used predominantly to finance the fiscal deficit, and they have also played an important part in bolstering the central bank's foreign-exchange reserves. Previously, the government had relied almost exclusively on issuing securities to local banks to finance the deficit. The shift to external deficit financing, and the steady lowering of the deficit itself, will make more liquidity available in the banking system for lending to the private sector.
Borrowing costs set to fall for Egyptian businesses in the medium term
Lending to the private sector is likely to grow during the forecast period as the CBE progressively loosens monetary policy in response to falling inflation. The surge in inflation in the wake of the November 2016 flotation prompted the CBE to push up interest rates by 700 basis points in a series of hikes, the last of which was in July 2017. Inflation started to ease at the end of 2017, and the CBE cut rates by a total of 200 basis points in 2018, bringing its main operation rate down to 17.25%. Further cuts of 100 basis points in February 2019 and 150 bps in August have brought the rate down to 14.75%. With inflation continuing to ease, and with US and European monetary authorities also on an easing cycle, businesses in Egypt can look forward to a steady lowering of their borrowing costs during the first half of the forecast period.
According to the CBE, non-performing loans (NPLs) accounted for 4.1% of total loans in March 2019, significantly lower than in 2015, when NPLs made up 7.1% of total loans. However, this improvement in loan quality has come about partly because of the preference of banks to lend to the government rather than to private businesses. As lending to business revives, we expect that the NPL ratio will also increase, but from a relatively low base.
The stockmarket attracted strong inflows of foreign portfolio invest-ment following the flotation of the pound, but there was a slowdown in 2018 amid wider concerns among international investors about emerging-market risk. The market has rallied in 2019, amid the general recovery of portfolio investment inflows. We expect Egypt to continue to attract significant levels of inward investment into equities, as a stream of initial public offerings (IPOs) by both private and partly state-owned companies come to the market, mostly from 2021. The government has announced plans for stockmarket flotation of some state assets. The EGX30 index fell by 13.3% in 2018, despite a bullish start to the year; in the first eight months of 2019, the index rose by about 10%.
According to a draft banking law that is currently under consideration by parliament, the minimum capital for commercial banks is set to rise tenfold to E£5bn (US$300m). Banks will be given three years to comply. The new capital levels have been set with a view to complying with Basel III and Basel IV regulations, and to take account of devaluation since the previous level was established in 2003. Several smaller banks are likely to merge in order to comply with the new capital requirements.

The labour market score and ranking rise for the forecast period, in line with the general improvement in macroeconomic conditions. From a business perspective, the Egyptian labour market offers an abundance of young workers, with graduates, post-graduates and skilled and semi-skilled technicians available at very competitive rates. There are several drawbacks, however, notably the rigidity of labour market laws-which are set to become more restrictive-and regulations that make it difficult to fire workers (partly because it is an extremely costly exercise). Employers are likely to face increased pressure from workers for pay increases to compensate for the fall in real wages in recent years and the rise in the poverty rate over the past few years. Real earnings were hit hard during the surge in inflation following the 2016 devaluation, and the official poverty rate reached 32.5% in the 2017/18 fiscal year, compared with 27.8% at the time of the previous assessment, for 2014/15. Workers' bargaining power is likely to be enhanced by the recent fall in unemployment.
Unemployment is falling
After reaching almost 13% in 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen steadily over the past three years, reaching 7.5% in mid-2019. We expect unemployment to stabilise at lower levels as increased private-sector activity and an increase in job opportunities associated with major infrastructure projects, such as the Suez Canal development zone and the establishment of a new capital city provide employment. However, the fall in the official unemployment rate is partly attributable to the steady decline in the labour participation rate to 43.3% in 2018 from a recent peak of 49% in 2010, suggesting many disaffected Egyptians are no longer searching for work.
The government has sought to lessen the risk of labour unrest by announcing a significant increase in the minimum wage for all workers in the state sector, to E£2,000 (US$120) per month, with effect from July 2019. The minimum wage was previously increased to E£1,200 per month in 2014. The government also increased the basic state pension by E£150 per month to E£900. Proposed reforms to the pension system, entailing a gradual increase in the retirement age to 65 from 60 and a shift to a hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution scheme tied to average lifetime earnings, rather than final salary, could also prompt opposition from workers.
Focus on private-sector employment
The government will try to shift the burden of creating jobs back to the private sector once economic growth starts to accelerate. In 2018 it also launched education reforms tailored to improving the skills of the future labour force.

Egypt's score for the quality of its infrastructure improves during the forecast period, and its regional ranking rises by one place to tenth, although the global ranking slips by four positions. This reflects heavy and ongoing investment in upgrading infrastructure, with a particular focus on energy and transportation, but even with the implementation of these major projects significant gaps remain in infrastructure. The military will take a pre-eminent role in many infrastructure projects, particularly for transport
Big power capacity push
The principal focus of the investment drive in the past few years has been the energy sector. Between June 2014 and June 2018 installed electricity-generating capacity rose from 32 GW to 55 GW, as a result of a 3.6-GW emergency gas turbine installation plan, the completion of delayed projects, and the start-up of three 4.8-GW combined-cycle plants built by Siemens of Germany. The power sector has also benefited from an improvement in natural gas supply, initially through imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and more recently owing to a rapid rise in domestic production. There is now a comfortable surplus of more than 20 GW of capacity over peak load.
The contribution of renewable energy to total power capacity will increase over the forecast period, with the recent start-up of 1.5 GW of solar capacity developed under a feed-in tariff programme and the development of a series of large-scale wind farms and solar installations.
Work will start during the forecast period on a 4.8-GW nuclear power station at El Dabaa, west of Alexandria. The project is to be carried out by Rosatom of Russia through a directly negotiated contract, including the supply of fuel and the disposal of waste. Contracts have also been negotiated with Chinese and UAE developers for two large-scale coal-fired power stations, but there is some doubt as to whether these will go ahead.
The government is investing heavily in energy and transport infrastructure
The completion of a new 72-km channel in the Suez Canal has improved services for international shipping. A new channel has also been dredged at the northern end of the canal to upgrade access to the East Port Said container terminal and to allow for its expansion. A second terminal is likely to be built, although contract negotiations for this have so far failed to progress.
Major rail transport projects will make progress during the forecast period. These include a monorail system serving the new administrative capital and the new 6th of October City, for which a contract was signed in mid-2019 with Canada-based Bombardier. The government is also pressing ahead with upgrades to the existing rail system, which has a poor safety record. The government has invited bids for a railway linking Sokhna, on the Gulf of Suez, to the Mediterranean. Further sections of the Cairo metro will be completed during the forecast period. The road network will continue to be expanded under the supervision of the Egyptian Armed Forces Engineering Agency. These will include the completion of the Rod el-Farag axis across northern Cairo.

Egypt is not keeping pace with technological developments
We assess Egypt's technological readiness for business as one of the country's weaknesses, based on patent applications, quality of e-commerce infrastructure, the scope of e-government and internet usage, among other criteria. Egypt's score for technological readiness falls marginally for the forecast period as it fails to keep up fully with the pace of technological change, and the country's global ranking slips owing to improvements elsewhere in that area. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) was established by the government in 1999 to support and promote a national information and communications technology (ICT) sector. The main areas of focus for the ministry are telecommunications, digital citizenship, human capacity, industry development and innovation. To date, progress has been slow, as indicated by Egypt's low (albeit improving) ranking on the World Intellectual Property Organisation's 2019 Global Innovation Index at 92nd out of 129 ranked countries. The main weakness for Egypt appears to be in ICT infrastructure, while slow progress is being made in institutional capacity and market sophistication, as well as business complexity.
The ICT sector is gaining increasing attention from the government
The government envisages the technology sector as being one of the main drivers of economic growth over the next five years, including the development of new ICT investment clusters-for example, a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. However, there is a long way to go before Egypt's technological infrastructure will be ready.
According to the Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform, the telecoms sector grew by 16.6% year on year in real terms in the first three-quarters of 2018/19 and the ICT sector grew by 3.8%. The telecoms sector is also growing rapidly, with the rollout of 4G and improved data provision helping to support growth in e-commerce and in the use of data services.
Egypt tested 5G mobile data during the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019 but a broader buildout will take some years, with those firms using hardware from the Chinese company, Huawei, likely to face political pressure from the US.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
A pro-business policy direction will be maintained under Mr Sisi, providing consistency during the ongoing economic transition. In the short term, economic policy will continue to be shaped by IMF-agreed conditions. In November 2016 the IMF approved a three-year US$12bn extended fund facility (EFF) for Egypt, with the final US$2bn tranche disbursed in August. Egypt is now able to raise funds elsewhere. It is therefore unlikely to seek a new funded IMF programme once the current one expires, but it has indicated interest in a looser, unfunded arrangement. Since 2016 the government has pushed through major reforms, including the introduction of value-added tax (VAT); the initial 13% rate was raised to 14% in fiscal year 2018/19 (July-June). The government has pushed through a series of cuts to fuel subsidies, most recently in April 2019, although implementation of further subsidy reforms could well be delayed by political considerations. A more flexible exchange-rate policy will stay in place.
These measures have been accompanied by structural reforms to address deficiencies in the business environment. The 2017 investment law has eased considerably the process of establishing companies and obtaining licences, with further changes planned to improve investment incentives and regularise data. Reforms have brought in significant new foreign investment, but some hurdles remain, making exporting industries uncompetitive. Moreover, the influence of powerful interest groups within government, especially the extensive and growing business interests of the military, will limit the effectiveness of the reform process. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has relaxed most capital controls (introduced in 2011), owing to the growing availability of hard currency and improved access to foreign capital markets, although rollover risks remain.
The government has also resumed its sale of state assets but will proceed cautiously due to political considerations. Concerned at restoring his popularity after three years of tough economic reforms and ongoing subsidy tightening, public-sector wage and pension increases have been introduced and social safety-net programmes improved with World Bank assistance. Water and rail infrastructure and addressing rural underdevelopment-especially in the restive Sinai region-will be prioritised, as will slum clearance, although fiscal constraints will limit these efforts.
Egypt will also seek to advance its role as a regional energy hub for the Eastern Mediterranean and as a gas exporter. The 30-trn-cu-ft Zohr gasfield off the Egyptian coast-production from which began in late 2017-is the largest gasfield so far discovered in the Mediterranean and is potentially large enough to meet Egypt's entire domestic gas needs for a decade. Other gas-resource development projects have been initiated, although some have suffered setbacks. Egypt has also signed export deals with Jordan, effective from 2020, and with Israel for gas transport and processing, probably for onward export, again from 2020.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government revenue 20.6 22.3 23.8 23.7 23.4 23.4
Budget balance -9.5 -6.8 -6.3 -6.0 -5.9 -5.6
Government debt 89.5 82.4 79.6 76.7 74.3 72.4
Government policy will seek to balance the goal of achieving fiscal sustainability-as illustrated by the continued reduction of the budget deficit as a share of GDP since the start of the IMF-backed reform programme-with containing public discontent over the ramifications of economic reform through supportive transfer payments for the less well-off. The decision to increase minimum levels for public-sector wages and pensions will add to the fiscal burden and slow the pace of consolidation. However, the public finances will still be strengthened in 2019-23 by rising tax revenue, in tandem with continued robust GDP growth. The government will gradually divert spending away from subsidies towards public services such as healthcare and education. The government will rely primarily on VAT to generate tax revenue. It is likely to leave the corporate tax rate unchanged at 22.5% in the early part of the forecast period in order to encourage investment. The narrowing (albeit still large) deficit will reduce crowding-out and should allow local interest-rate cuts, reducing the cost of companies' borrowing from domestic banks. The latest round of fuel-subsidy cuts, which began in April, with additional cuts in July for more widely used fuels, will increase firms' production costs, although lower global oil prices in 2019-20 and rising natural gas production from the Zohr field should help to stabilise domestic energy prices. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the fiscal deficit to narrow in 2018/19, to 6.8% of GDP, from 9.5% of GDP in 2017/18. Thereafter, the pace of decline will ease, with the deficit narrowing to 5.6% of GDP in 2022/23. International sovereign bonds will finance the bulk of the deficits, with multilateral and bilateral borrowing likely to cover the remainder.

3-month Treasury-bill rate (year-end) 19.8 17.2 15.2 14.3 13.5 12.2
Monetary policy will be used mainly to target inflation, which averaged almost 30% in 2017-after the Egyptian pound's flotation-but eased to 14.4% in 2018. This allowed the CBE to cut policy rates by 200 basis points in 2018, with a further 100-basis-point cut in February 2019. With inflation falling further, even with a fresh round of subsidy cuts pushing up local prices and interest rates moving down globally, the CBE announced an additional 150-basis-point cut in August, leaving the key policy rate at 14.25%. The CBE will be wary of the risk of currency volatility, although concerns about capital outflows are easing. Continued declines in inflation and real currency appreciation (as gas exports rise), should encourage further monetary easing and lead to improved credit conditions.

Real GDP growth reached 5.6% in 2018/19, but we expect it to slow to 5% in 2019/20 as global demand weakens. Egypt's economy will nevertheless grow strongly, expanding at an annual average rate of 5.6% in 2019-23. Lower unemployment and the improved investment climate will boost private consumption, although widespread poverty and high inflation will remain a constraint on consumer demand growth. The construction and energy sectors are the main engines of growth. In partnership with private contractors, the government is pursuing various low-income housing schemes, as well as the construction of a new (administrative) capital city, to the east of Cairo, to be completed in 2020. Production from the Zohr gasfield, which came on stream at end-2017, will sharply reduce (but not eliminate) the need for fuel imports, but capital imports will remain high to support the country's infrastructure projects. The slowdown in Europe, Egypt's main export market, will affect tourism and other sectors.
Growing confidence in the availability of hard currency will provide a much-needed boost to business sentiment and will help to attract foreign investors, especially in the latter years of the forecast period. With growth becoming increasingly broad-based and unemployment falling, consumer spending should pick up from 2020. The development of hydrocarbons resources and processing capabilities could further boost growth in the longer term.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
The manufacturing sector, which includes oil refining, accounts for nearly one-tenth of real GDP, but the challenges facing the sector are numerous. Local manufacturing suffers from quality issues and is often unable to match competition from imported goods. Egyptian exports are likely to benefit in the coming years from the impact of the November 2016 currency flotation, but, so far, the competitiveness of manufactured goods has been undermined by a spike in the costs of imported intermediate goods and raw materials. Weak global demand in recent years has also been a hindrance for the sector and will also slow growth in 2019-20 as global trade performance weakens. On top of this, many factories have been forced to curtail production significantly (or even shut down) in recent years, as hard-currency shortages and central bank-imposed import controls meant that local manufacturers could not procure the necessary imports of intermediate goods and raw materials, although this has become less of a problem more recently.
The outlook for the oil and gas sector continues to improve, owing to substantial investments coming on stream from international oil companies (IOCs). Because of political instability, production in both sectors declined, and government debt owed to IOCs has built up in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising. However, the oil industtry is currently experiencing an upturn in its fortunes-aided by a modest recovery in oil prices in 2017-18-with BP advancing the development of the US$12bn West Nile Delta project to develop fields that have proven reserves of 5trn cu ft of natural gas and 55m barrels of condensates, with considerable further potential. The scheme aims to reach plateau output of 1.4bn cu ft/day from late 2019, which would be a significant addition to Egypt's current output of about 5bn cu ft/day. Of even greater significance, Italy's Eni revealed in August 2015 that it had made a historic discovery of a supergiant gasfield, the largest ever in the Mediterranean. Known as Zohr, it holds around 30trn cu ft of gas and is potentially big enough to meet Egypt's entire domestic needs and restart exports. Eni has embarked on a fast-track development of Zohr, with production beginning in late 2017, and set to reach its plateau level of 3.2bn cu ft/day in 2020; it had reached 2.7bn cu ft/day by mid-2019.
The services sector-another major employer and traditionally a significant component of the economy-has experienced unprecedented setbacks, notably the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai by militants in October 2015 and the loss of an EgyptAir flight, which crashed into the Mediterranean in March 2016. After the Sinai crash, tourist arrivals fell to an average of about 400,000 a month (with a modest uptick in arrivals in 2017), from 900,000 on average in the six months preceding that incident. Nevertheless, the outlook for services remains positive over the long term, as shown by the strong recovery in tourist arrivals since early 2018. In 2018 there were 11.4m visitors, the highest annual total since 2012, and up by 36.8%; foreign visitor arrivals were up by a further 4% year on year in the first quarter of 2019, which suggests the pace of recovery is beginning to level off. The government has revealed an ambitious plan of boosting tourism revenue to US$26bn by 2020, but this will also depend on the level of investment in the sector and the impact of global economic conditions on tourist spending. Other important components of services, including the financial services and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors, which have been strong drivers of growth in recent years, will also continue to expand.
Construction and transport are likely to continue to be among the fastest-growing sectors. Projects such as the new administrative capital and 13 other satellite cities under development will underpin strong growth in the construction and building materials sectors. The first phase of the new capital is nearing completion, and private developers are preparing to embark on building new residential and commercial areas. The main foreign participant is China State Construction and Engineering Corporation, which is building the central business district. The new capital has generated a number of major transport schemes, notably a new monorail system that will link it to Cairo, and which will include a line from Cairo to the 6th of October City industrial and residential area to the south-west. The government is also promoting investment in logistics, including a series of inland dry ports to be carried out on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.

Consumer prices 14.4 9.1 7.8 8.3 7.8 7.0
Despite an uptick earlier in the year and strong monthly price rises in the wake of further subsidy cuts in July, inflation fell to a four-year low that month. In 2019-20 we expect inflation to decline to an average of 8.5% a year. The effects of fuel-subsidy cuts and continued growth in non-oil commodity prices (except in 2019) will be contained by lower international oil prices. Thereafter, we expect inflation to remain close to these levels, with currency appreciation helping to offset the impact of higher international prices, but stronger domestic demand limiting falls in inflation. Overall, average annual inflation should remain in single digits, falling to 7% in 2023.

Having weakened from E£8.88:US$1, following the currency flotation in late 2016, to E£17.91:US$1 at end-2018, the pound has experienced a marked appreciation, which will be broadly sustained during the forecast period. The pound eased only slightly in the wake of the August interest-rate cut, owing to rising confidence in the CBE's management of exchange-rate policy and stronger capital inflows. In the short term, some of the recent sharp gains in the pound are likely to be reversed, but, in the longer term, there is potential for more real exchange-rate appreciation, reflecting a growing natural-resource endowment and a downwards trend in inflation. The flotation has eliminated the black market and helped to restore confidence in the pound, while allowing the banking system to capture much of the US dollar liquidity in unofficial circulation. The pound will come under renewed pressure, with the CBE or state banks selling foreign exchange in a bid to support the currency, although the level of intervention will fall, with the CBE reducing the banking sector's powers to influence the market directly. We expect sporadic volatility, but, overall, the pound will strengthen to an average of E£16.35:US$1 in 2023.

The trade deficit will narrow in 2019-20 as lower energy import volumes (owing to growing domestic hydrocarbons production, principally from the Zohr gasfield) and values lead to a decline in the import bill. With service exports growing strongly, the current account is expected to shift from a small deficit to a modest surplus in 2020, owing to rising goods exports and tourism earnings, offsetting a pick-up in imports that reflects a steady flow of capital inputs for infrastructure projects. The current-account surplus will edge up to 1.2% of GDP in 2023. Sources of income such as official transfers, tourism receipts, remittances and Suez Canal earnings are likely to be affected by slower global growth in 2020, but will continue to grow overall t

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Egypt
Stocks and flows
Despite uncertainty about Egypt's political transition, foreign direct investment (FDI) rose steadily between 2012 and 2016, reaching US$8.1bn, reflecting strong global market conditions. Inflows have declined since then, to US$7.4bn in 2017 and US$6.8bn in 2018, although the government maintains that Egypt's share of global investment flows has increased. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a recovery-initially fairly slow, reflecting global economic weakness--during the forecast period, reflecting improvements in the business environment and a wider availability of hard currency to meet business needs. We also forecast that outward direct investment will increase during the forecast period as healthier liquidity levels and easing foreign-exchange shortages enable companies to expand their overseas operations.
Origin and distribution
EU-based investors, the majority of which are British firms, have accounted for about two-thirds of total inward FDI flows to Egypt during the past five years, and the US and Arab countries have supplied most of the remainder. The UAE has been the largest source of investment among Arab countries, by a significant margin, followed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Chinese companies have shown increasing interest in investing in Egypt, but, according to the most recent central bank data, China only accounted for about 1% of gross FDI inflows in 2016/17 and 2017/18. A slowing Chinese economy, as well as the US-China trade and technology disputes, are likely to hamper further growth in investment from China. FDI inflows are heavily skewed towards the oil and gas sector, reflecting the major ongoing investment in developing new natural gas fields. In the first three-quarters of 2018/19, oil and gas accounted for 62% of total new FDI inflows, compared with 19% for greenfield projects and 16% for real estate.
Determinants
Besides market size and the availability of cheap labour, the main determinants of FDI include the business and legal environment and the availability of foreign exchange for imports and profit repatriation. Under the current regime, the government is seeking to resolve a number of long-running disputes with Gulf Arab (and other foreign) investors, as part of a broader effort to encourage regional players to increase their activity in Egypt. The former investment minister, Dalia Khorshid, and her successor, Sahar Nasr, have both devoted fresh energy into settling these disputes. Efforts to establish new free zones-such as the Suez Canal Development Zone-may help court investments, Downside risks to FDI will persist. These include business environment deficiencies, weak lending by domestic banks and the economic slowdown in Europe, a major source of FDI. Other potential sources of hindrance include the spillover effects of the bilateral trade dispute between the US and China.
Impact
Increased FDI has helped to transform Egypt into a more modern market economy. Foreign firms are aiding economic diversification, improving the quality of human capital through better managerial and technical skills, increasing employment opportunities and assisting the transfer of technology. Leading petroleum firms are helping the government to exploit its rich oil and gas endowment and generating budget revenue.

Egypt's population will exceed 100m by the end of the forecast period
Egypt's growing population provides opportunities but is also among the biggest challenges facing the govern-ment, as it places additional strains on the labour market and public services such as healthcare and education. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will rise from 97.1m in 2018 to around 107.4m by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2%-nearly double the average for most developing countries-with rural areas experiencing higher growth rates than urban centres. The growth rate is likely to be different from the recent historical trend, reflecting our expectation that recently launched family-planning campaigns and the high cost of living since the 2016 currency flotation will reduce fertility rates.
Labour force to expand even faster than overall population
It is worth noting, however, that the labour force will continue to expand at a faster pace than the overall population, at about 3.7% a year in 2019-23, owing to a youthful demographic bulge. Egypt is the most populous Arab country, and even modest growth rates will result in a large increase in the population; the population increased by over 10m in 2014-18 alone.
Almost one-third of the population is below the age of 15, and more than half is below 24. About 700,000 new entrants join the labour market annually, and unemployment rose in the wake of the 2011 uprising, as real GDP growth averaged well below the 6-7% required to absorb the growing labour force. The situation was aggravated in 2011, when hundreds of thousands of migrant workers fled back to the country to escape fighting in Libya. With the economy failing to provide sufficient jobs, many Egyptians have turned to the informal sector in search of employ-ment, although they tend to be lower paid and less secure. Official data suggest that unemployment has recently been on a sharp downwards trend-falling from 12.6% in the second quarter of 2016 to 7.5% by the second quarter of 2019-the lowest level since the 2011 uprising.
Outward migration to the Gulf states, Europe and North America will continue
Outward migration from Egypt to neighbouring Gulf Arab states, Europe and North America will continue as a by-product of slow economic growth. According to CAPMAS, 9.4m Egyptians lived abroad at end-2017, and expatriate remittances are among the major sources of foreign-exchange receipts for the country. However, migrating to the oil-rich Gulf Arab states is now becoming increasingly difficult, as these countries have stepped up their programmes to increase the proportion of their own nationals in the workforce. Similarly, public opinion in Europe and North America is turning increasingly against economic migrants, which is likely to be reflected in tighter immigration rules and restrictions on foreign labour inflows.
Poverty rate continues to rise
Other consequences of Egypt's recent political and economic turbulence include a rise in the rate of poverty since 2011. According to the results of a household survey published by CAPMAS in July 2019, the poverty rate (calculated at an income below E£735.7 per head per month, equivalent to US$41 monthly or US$1.4 a day, and lower in US dollar terms then the level set in 2014/15) reached 32.5% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. This was 4.7 percentage points higher than in the previous published survey, for 2014/15, and reflected the impact of economic reforms enacted since 2016 with the support of the IMF, which have squeezed household spending power. The prime minister, Mustafa Madbouly, said that the rise in the poverty rate was relatively small in the context of the scale of the fiscal adjustment that the government had been obliged to make, and that effects had been mitigated by social protection programmes, but consumer spending has been hit. The absolute poverty rate in 2017/18 was 6.2%, according to a line set at E£490.8 per month, compared with a rate of 5.3% in 2014/15, based on income of E£322 per month.
Egypt has a highly urbanised population, with nearly 10m people living in Cairo alone. With this in mind, the government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has taken steps to promote internal migration from the overcrowded Nile Valley into unpopulated tracts of desert. These include a demarcation plan to create three new governorates-Central Sinai, Al Alamein and Al Wahat-bringing the total to 30. The government is also undertaking a number of major industrial projects outside urban centres, such as the Suez Canal Development Zone, with the aim of boosting employ-ment opportunities in the long-neglected rural areas. The government has embarked on the construction of 14 new satellite cities. The largest of these is the new administrative capital, which is envisaged as eventually housing 6m people.

High inflation will undermine household purchasing power in the near term
Purchasing power was eroded in the immediate aftermath of the November 2016 currency flotation, which led to severe inflationary effects. Amid this challenging backdrop, retail sales declined in 2017 in US-dollar terms-although there was some recovery in 2018 as inflation started to fall. Nonetheless, as the most populous country in the Middle East and North Africa, Egypt's size makes it an important market in the region, with huge potential (particularly in the second half of the forecast period) that will continue to grow over the long term. The population is easily accessible, not least because it is located in an extremely concentrated geographical area. That said, GDP per head remains low compared with many other countries in the region, and the headline figures mask wide disparities in income between the rich and the poor. After the flotation-induced contraction in 2017, Egypt's GDP per head is now expected to climb rapidly, reaching US$4,940 by 2023, although this will remain low by regional standards.
Nevertheless, the spending power of a sizeable minority of the population, who reside mainly in newly built cities and neighbourhoods such as New Cairo and 6th of October, is comparable to that of consumers in the industrialised world. Even with the currency-policy changes, this segment retains substantial disposable income and is prepared to spend it on consumer goods. A government survey published in July 2016 showed that the richest 10% of the population accounted for one-quarter of total spending by Egyptians. This indicates the extent of the inequality between rich and poor households in the country, with recent increases in the poverty rate likely to have intensified this polarisation. Later in the forecast period, as the economy experiences several years of broader growth and more manageable price growth, and as lower unemployment helps to boost private consumption, purchasing power will improve across a wider swathe of the population although large disparities will still remain.
In any case, despite the large population, Egypt's retail markets have seen little investment since 2011, which means that the market is undersaturated and assets are underpriced. This could provide opportunities for foreign companies seeking to establish a foothold in the country, but much will depend on the government's commitment to policy reform. Importantly, import-control measures imposed by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the government have led to supply bottlenecks for many goods, which has created a need to boost output by local manufacturers in order to fill the growing gap between supply and demand.

In common with the rest of the region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Despite The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast of recovering household incomes, mass-consumer expenditure in Egypt is likely to remain dominated by spending on basic household items, primarily food and beverages, as well as housing, although their share of spending will start to dip toward the end of the forecast period. This is because a substantial chunk of the population will remain at or just above the poverty line, which means that a large proportion of disposable income is spent on subsistence; poverty rates have risen over the historical period although they are likely to begin to edge down in the forecast period, translating into a slow shift in spending patterns among some groups.
In the long run, demand for higher-end consumer goods will be underpinned by rising incomes, employment and population growth. Demand for more sophisticated, foreign-produced electrical goods is certain to grow, not least because of mistrust of the quality of locally produced goods. Other markets will increase in importance as the forecast period progresses, however, notably transport and communications. As car ownership rises and demand for mobile and internet technology takes off, a rising proportion of household income will be spent on these items.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Egypt began addressing decades-old market distortions in 2016, backed by significant external financial support. The government of the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has retained the policies of the previous cabinet-centred around economic liberalisation, but progress has been slow at times. Moreover, the public finances are stretched, and the government continues to labour under a large (but gradually declining) fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, agreement reached with the IMF in 2016 and the subsequent economic policy changes have helped to shore up investor confidence in the economy. The economy is well diversified, and the abundance of cheap labour, coupled with its large market size, means that Egypt still has huge potential over the long term.
Demographic trends: Egypt's high population density has some advantages: access to consumers is relatively easy, especially in the two urban centres, Cairo and Alexandria. Demographic trends are broadly favourable to growth prospects, in that the working-age population will continue to rise more rapidly than the overall population throughout the forecast period owing to the youthful demographic bulge. However, this will also add to the burden on public services such as education and healthcare. The government will press ahead with projects to develop areas of the desert beyond the Nile Valley to alleviate pressure on infrastructure. This will be supported by the government's efforts to reclaim 1.5m feddans (630,000 ha) of land. With most of the land surface uninhabited, the government will push ahead with long-awaited plans to create a number of new governorates, an idea that was first mooted in 2005 and later revived by the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in late 2014, who has since pushed forward with major urban construction projects, including a new administrative capital.
External conditions: External conditions will remain dependent on demand from key export markets in North America and the EU-Egypt's largest trading partner. The broader region is also embroiled in political and security turmoil, which will continue to dampen investment sentiment across the Middle East as a whole. However, over the longer term, economic recovery in Europe and the US should translate into higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as growing exports. Similarly, reliance on financial assistance should decline gradually as structural reforms put the economy back on a sustainable footing.
Institutions and policy trends: The present and future governments will work to streamline the bureaucracy and boost the accountability of public officials. They will also look to downsize the bloated public sector, which means that private-sector participation in the economy and attracting FDI will be key to developing the country's infrastructure and improving public services. However, such reforms will be slow and protracted, largely as a result of the presence of deeply entrenched interest groups in the government and the powerful influence of business lobby groups and of the military on the state. Moreover, democratic accountability will stay low with authority centred around the presidency. Threats to long-term political and social stability may persist, reflecting the stand-off between the state and its liberal opponents, as well as high unemployment rates and high levels of poverty.
Long-term performance: There is significant potential for strong real GDP growth over the long term. Egypt is a prime location as a base to export to Asia, Africa and Europe and has a plentiful and low-cost workforce. However, success will also depend on an ongoing commitment to economic reform and to major improvements in political and institutional effectiveness. The government must increase the efficiency of the bureaucracy; develop a more effective commercial legal system; continue to withdraw the state from economic activity; and reform the public finances. Progress is likely to be patchy, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects real GDP growth to average 3.5% a year in 2019-30 and 2.9% in 2019-50, with labour productivity growth helping to offset slower population growth.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Egypt has been struggling with rising temperatures in recent years, with summer heat typically averaging above 35 C. This results in spikes in energy consumption during the hot summer season by both households and industrial users. However, successive heat waves and worsening climate conditions globally could create new health dangers for residents of the country, as well as the broader Middle East and North Africa region-particularly as the summer season lengthens and humidity levels rise further. This may also reduce arable land in Egypt, which is already facing the threat of worsening water scarcity as construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam (located on the Nile, downstream in Ethiopia) is completed in the coming years. The reduced ability of the human body to cool off through sweating in higher temperatures and humidity conditions are likely to lower the productivity of workers involved in construction and other outdoor activities (even at night). All of this will boost demand for energy further as time goes by and weather conditions deteriorate. The government is increasingly looking to renewable sources, especially solar, to meet power demand, but remains heavily dependent on natural gas. As part of managing the greater demand for energy, local authorities will need to diversify the energy mix to include more renewable sources of power.
Technological developments
The government envisages the technology sector as being one of the main drivers of economic growth over the next five years, including the development of new information and communications technology (ICT) investment clusters, for example a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Telecoms and the ICT sector have grown rapidly in recent years as 4G rollout has accelerated. Future growth is highly likely, considering the growing interest by foreigners in Egypt as a budding offshore IT centre. Indeed, despite the modest performance by regional comparison, Egypt has been gaining increasing attention by foreign companies as an outsourcing centre for IT operations-owing in part to the abundance of skilled workers and the country's proximity to European markets. A report by Gartner, an IT advisory group, ranked Egypt among the top nine locations for outsourcing in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
There are currently more than 6,000 Egyptian companies active in the ICT sector, most of them in activities related to the internet. The government estimates that Egypt earns about US$1.5bn in annual exports of ICT-related services, and this figure is likely to climb steadily. ICT accounted for close to 4% of GDP by mid-2019, according to the government, and it plans for it to reach 5% of GDP by 2022, targeting 12% growth a year in the sector. Exports of digital services have also grown strongly. The government has begun to roll out e-government services for households in select areas; internet penetration is still fairly modest, although it is used in the business sector to a limited extent. The number of internet users rose by an estimated 15% to 45.3m in early 2019, giving Egypt an internet penetration rate of 48%, compared with only 20% in 2009. We expect internet penetration to exceed half of the population by 2020-21. About 44.3% of Egyptian households currently use the internet, according to data from the MCIT.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2014-18) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2019-23). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2014-18. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2019-23 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2014-18 ranges are then used to derive 2019-23 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2019-23, not to the likely situation in 2023 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2016 or 2021). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The 2019 general elections resulted in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) obtaining a majority in the lower house of parliament. This will underpin political stability in 2019-23. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration.
Relations with the US will remain warm in 2019-23, albeit punctuated by trade tensions. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Relations with Pakistan will also be tense, owing to continuing border tensions. Low-level military clashes between the two countries remain likely in 2019-23.
We do not expect concerted efforts to narrow the fiscal deficit in fiscal years 2019/20-2023/24 (April-March), as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments.
Real GDP growth will slump to 5.2% in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.7% in 2020/21-2023/24.
We expect consumer price inflation to average 4% a year in 2019-23. Lower crude oil costs will restrain inflation in the first two years of the forecast period, allowing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to maintain an accommodative stance. The RBI will take a more hawkish stance from 2021 onwards as stronger domestic demand adds to price pressures.
In annual average terms the rupee will depreciate against the US dollar in 2019, and again in 2021-23, reflecting India's current-account deficit. However, the rupee will appreciate against the dollar in 2020 as the US loosens its monetary policy, widening the gap between US and Indian interest rates.
India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. The services trade and secondary income accounts will record surpluses, partly offsetting the goods trade deficit. The current-account balance will remain in deficit in 2019-23, with the annual shortfall averaging the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2021-23: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closing of loss-making businesses and their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Restrictions on foreign investment in sectors such as insurance, aviation and media are eased. Sourcing controls on foreign investment in single-brand retail are also liberalised.
2021-23: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few geographic regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: A limited trade war with the US continues, despite the damage it inflicts on bilateral strategic ties.
2021-23: The government makes some efforts to further ease the process of borrowing overseas for companies and to reduce capital-account restrictions. However, full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes
2019-20: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2021-23: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing
2019-20: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2021-23: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues in public-sector banks persist.
The labour market
2019-20: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2021-23: Some labour reforms make headway at the state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure
2019-20: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2021-23: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore.
2021-23: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

a Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.34bn people in 2017, according to the UN. Its economy was the sixth-largest in the world in 2017 when measured in nominal US dollars, but the third-largest at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be shallow.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2019-23, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The BJP won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's dominance of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure consistency in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the recent election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the National Security Advisor played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Sporadic instances of street violence occurred during the term of the first Modi government, directed particularly towards minority groups. The BJP's right-wing affiliates and sister organisations within the larger Hindu right-wing ecosystem (colloquially known as the Sangh Parivar) used the BJP's political power to pursue their socio-cultural agenda. This includes a goal of recasting India as a Hindu state-a view that puts them at odds with the country's large Muslim minority. Such attacks will persist over the forecast period, but we do not expect them to have a major impact on the business environment.
There is a risk that clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have increased in recent years amid concerns among some Hindu groups about an influx of people from the neighbouring Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh. However, state governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, in order to avoid public criticism and international scrutiny.
The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir will result in a marked deterioration in political stability in that region. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders within the area, instances of unrest have been reported. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move will also increase the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
In the second half of 2019 assembly elections will be conducted in three states-Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana. The BJP and its allies currently hold over 85% of all available Lok Sabha seats in these three states, and we expect the outgoing BJP governments in all three to secure a second term in office.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they are significantly short of a majority. Given the BJP's strong performance in the general election, we now believe that the party will dominate the upcoming state elections, enabling it to nominate more members to the upper house (Rajya Sabha members are elected by state assemblies). The BJP and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are therefore expected to achieve a majority in the Rajya Sabha by mid-2021. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Tensions with Pakistan will be heightened further by the Indian government's revocation of the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's response will be constrained by its foreign-exchange shortages, which will limit it to low-cost strategies. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2019-23, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
Trade tensions between the US and India will persist over the next few years, slowing the expansion of bilateral trade flows. However, they are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration in relations. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence. To this effect, India has boosted security co-operation with the US in recent years, and this will continue during our forecast period.
China's growing influence in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2019-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks. We believe that this sum, if delivered in full, would be sufficient to substantially address balance-sheet problems, but implementation may be a challenge.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: construction, tourism, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a bone of contention with countries such as the US in 2019-23. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Once the NDA has control of the Rajya Sabha, from mid-2021, this will ease the challenges in the legislative process. However we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The new government's first budget, for the remainder of fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March) was less populist than we had initially anticipated. More firms will be able to enjoy a concessional 25% rate of corporation tax after revenue thresholds were raised. The budget also continued the government's efforts to simplify and digitise the tax system, including the regime for the goods and services tax (GST). Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low. More worryingly, there were signs in the budget that the government was seeking to use the customs regime to encourage import substitution-an approach that has failed badly in India in the past.
Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government. It will seek to increase the reach of schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. The rollback of an increased surcharge on high income earners will affect revenue collection in the short term. However, a one-off transfer of capital from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) in August will be more than adequate to offset this impact. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit will remain significant, averaging the equivalent of 3.3% of GDP a year in 2019/20-2022/23.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits of some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The RBI will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2019-23. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
Weak inflation, ebbing growth and pressure from the government have led the RBI to loosen policy several times in 2019. The most recent policy interest-rate cut in August, of 35 basis points, took the repurchase (repo) rate to a nine-year low of 5.4%. However, we believe that with inflation gradually recovering and policy rates already low by historical standards, the RBI will now hold rates until 2021. The central bank will then undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The Indian economy grew at the slowest rate in more than six years in the quarter ending June 2019. Real GDP growth slowed to 5% year on year in April-June, compared with a rate of 5.8% in the previous quarter. Depressed consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. Despite recent weak economic data, we believe that growth in most components is likely to have bottomed out and that the economy will start to regain momentum from the July-September quarter. A series of stimulus measures enacted by the government, coupled with a low-interest-rate environ-ment, are likely to spur demand and investment in the remaining quarters of 2019/20. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 5.2% in 2019/20.
Real GDP growth is expected to recover further to an average of 6.7% in 2020/21-2021/22 as domestic demand strengthens. A recovery in global growth in 2021 will also stimulate exports; however, higher domestic investment will also suck in imports. Growth is expected to moderate to 6.4% by 2023/24 as tighter monetary conditions dampen investment growth and deter consumption. India will remain among the fastest-growing major economies throughout the forecast period.
We do not expect a significant improvement in the pace of job creation in the forecast period, as government efforts will focus on small-scale industries and are unlikely to have the desired effect in boosting employment. The focus on smaller firms will crowd out the larger-scale enterprises that would be more productive and effective job-creators in the longer term. This effect will be aggravated by outdated labour laws that deter companies from scaling up. Economic growth will therefore remain below potential throughout the forecast period, despite stable inflation. In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential owing to structural limitations such as challenges relating to land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector will remain a drag on the economy. Public investment in the sector will be aimed at short-term gains, rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Prices of food and oil will remain the key factors driving inflationary pressures in 2019-23. Food and beverages have a weighting of around 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will affect price stability. Food price inflation has been weak in recent months, but we anticipate that it will accelerate in the second half of 2019, as crop yields during the summer harvest are expected to be lower than usual. Nevertheless, headline inflation will cool to 3.6% in 2019 on average, from 3.9% in 2018, owing to weaker crude oil prices this year.
Lower crude oil prices will also have a dampening effect on prices in 2020, but this will be offset by a modest pick-up in domestic demand growth, the RBI's accommodative monetary policy and the lagged effects of seasonal climatic factors from 2019. Average annual consumer price inflation will thus accelerate in 2020, to 4.2%. Later in the forecast period, continued strong economic growth will stoke demand-pull inflation, while a weakening of the rupee:US dollar exchange rate will exert an upward influence on prices in 2021-23, by pushing up the cost of imports. We expect consumer prices to rise by an annual average of 4% over 2019-23 as a whole.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Although the rupee has weakened sharply in the wake of the government's decision on Jammu and Kashmir, we regard this as a short-term effect. We continue to expect that a narrowing current-account deficit and improved investor sentiment will ease downward pressure on the rupee in 2019 as a whole, with the currency's exchange rate set to end the year stronger against the US dollar than it was at the end of 2018. However, in annual average terms the rupee will still depreciate in 2019, albeit mildly, weakening to Rs69.9:US$1, from Rs68.4:US$1 last year.
The rupee will appreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, supported by interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) against a backdrop of an economic slowdown in the US. In 2021-23 the rupee will return to a gradual depreciating trend against the US dollar, reflecting India's persistent current-account deficit and relatively high levels of inflation. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
A slowdown in merchandise imports, resulting from lower global oil prices and depressed demand for investment goods, will drive a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit in 2019-20. From 2021 onwards, stronger investment and higher oil prices will suck in imports, reversing that trend. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth of India's key service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP annually in 2019-23.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2019-23 as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$68bn by 2023, from US$42.1bn in 2018. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in 2018, owing to jittery investor confidence amid a currency crisis in emerging markets such as Turkey, which stoked fears of contagion, as well as rising US interest rates. We expect this trend to reverse in 2019-23 as investor confidence is gradually restored.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]we are assuming that regime members will deem amnesty offers as credible. Fixed investment will also diminish, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. [...]power cuts and fuel shortages are now commonplace-particularly outside Caracas-owing to severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), is under severe economic and political pressure. The Economist Intelligence Unit has for some time believed that the Maduro regime's position is unsustainable. We currently base our forecasts on a political transition within the five-year period (2019-23) that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, whom we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. Currently, we expect there to be some sort of regime change by the end of 2019. The timing and shape of the transition process, however, remains extremely uncertain, and we expect the entire forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Our expectation of a change of government by end-2019 implies huge changes to policymaking, as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented under the transitional and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, with the Guaidó administration seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and in potential donor nations (such as the US and EU members) of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry.
The pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of a new administration, and how this stability might be impaired by likely demands from multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals, and by the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. At the same time, the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, will need wholesale reform to open itself to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in the business environment rankings for 2019-23, up from 80th in the historical period. Assuming regime change, improvements are expected, but it will take time for reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment to bear fruit.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Start of rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls, but concerns over political instability slow liberalisation. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2021-23: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: Regulation by a new government protecting property rights introduced in an attempt to attract investment.
2021-23: Despite efforts, actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions on private-sector access to foreign currency remain.
2021-23: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit very slowly.
Taxes
2019-20: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2021-23: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but declining risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures.
Financing
2019-20: Inflation remains high and concerns around economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2021-23: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2019-20: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Large-scale emigration of skilled labour complicates hiring.
2021-23: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Underinvestment in the water network and electricity grid means that rationing and unpredictable blackouts continue. A new government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2021-23: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2019-20: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2021-23: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election of Hugo Chávez in 1998, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to an estimated US$18.8bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 2.1% of GDP.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
The civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) is under severe economic and political pressure, and The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that its position is unsustainable. We currently expect a political transition within our 2019-23 forecast period that introduces an interim administration led by Juan Guaidó, who we assume will undertake emergency adjustment measures and prepare the ground for eventual free and fair elections. At present, we assume regime change by end-2019, but the timing and shape of the transition process is highly uncertain. We expect the entire forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Our forecast for regime change is based on the extent of the economic and humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Venezuela. This has deeply damaged support for Mr Maduro among the population at large; we believe that it will ultimately erode his backing among key supporters in the military who are propping him up in power. It is less clear, however, what the exact trigger for regime change will be. There are three main paths to a political transition: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as very low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are set to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The escalation of US sanctions means that Mr Maduro can no longer guarantee the regime's raison d'être-the enrichment of its members-and we expect pragmatists within government and the military to turn on him, paving the way for some sort of political transition. However, a failed uprising on April 30th demonstrated the difficulty of this kind of initiative, and has incurred a heavy political cost, as the regime has become more vigilant of discontent among its ranks. The April uprising, which reportedly included top-ranking government officials alongside Mr Guaidó, confirmed cracks in the regime's ranks at the highest levels. Our forecast for regime change therefore still stands.
This forecast is underpinned by three key assumptions. The first is that regime pragmatists will prevail over hardliners. Despite the ongoing collapse of the patronage system, there are risks to this assumption, not least frequent purges within the military. The presence of dozens of important military figures also leads to co-ordination problems. Secondly, we are assuming that regime members will deem amnesty offers as credible. Risks to this assumption include a deep-seated distrust of the opposition and a fear of being prosecuted outside Venezuela (a well-founded concern, given accusations of drug- and weapon-trafficking against regime members). The third assumption underpinning our forecast is a continued lack of hard currency to sustain the patronage system. Risks to this forecast come in the form of greater than expected support from Russia or China, and from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, which could provide the regime with more hard currency than we currently expect.
We recognise the very high risks to our baseline view, and believe there are two main alternate scenarios. The first and more likely of these, is the maintenance of the status quo, with the population protest-weary, the regime hunkering down, the opposition deflating, and the country becoming increasingly isolated and impoverished. The second is one of prolonged chaos-including, possibly, armed conflict among regime factions. However, we expect neither of these scenarios to be feasible in the medium to long term. With no prospect of real reform, we believe that a chronically weak economy will ultimately make Mr Maduro's position untenable. Violent, chaotic conflict in Venezuela could prove the trigger for some kind of military action by the US and by Venezuela's Latin American neighbours to put an end to the crisis. For these reasons, we continue to believe that regime change in the forecast period remains highly likely, even if it does not occur in 2019.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The opposition's recently announced plans for a transitional government call for the renovation of all electoral authorities, and for elections within 12 months of its formation. Although this timeline is extremely ambitious, given the scale of the task, we expect national elections to take place by the end of 2020, under a transitional government. International assistance in organising elections would be necessary (and forthcoming). Deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority, the electoral registry and the voting system will be required, but rebuilding trust in the system will be difficult. If the Maduro regime manages to maintain the status quo, legislative elections would take place in December 2020. However, these elections would be neither free nor fair.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community. However, efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. Indeed, the US introduced new sanctions in August, the most important of which is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad that will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system. The US administration's hawkish approach introduces risks of a military intervention. We currently do not foresee large-scale military action, in part because such an initiative lacks international legitimacy. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Russia may well be helping the state oil company, PDVSA, to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). That said, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the necessary financing-amounting to tens of billions of dollars per year-to stabilise the economy and the long-term future of PDVSA itself. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seemingly with little success in terms of finance for investment. We believe that Russia and (especially) China would be willing to work with a successor government in an attempt to protect their current investments in Venezuela.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Our expectation of a change of government by end-2019 implies huge modifications to policymaking as a new administration works to end hyperinflation, restructure public debt, and rebuild institutions to restore confidence and promote investment. Until then, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. There has been evidence in recent months of attempts to tighten monetary policy in order to rein in hyperinflation and (in theory) to abandon foreign-exchange controls. However, we believe that such efforts are doomed to failure in the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform and improvements in the rule of law and policy predictability that will not be forthcoming under the present regime.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented under the transitional and successor governments. Many of these policies have been outlined already, The prospective Guaidó administration is seeking to reassure stakeholders in multilateral institutions and potential donor nations-such as the US and European countries-of its capacity to stabilise the economy, address the humanitarian emergency, generate trust and legal security, ensure access to basic public services, and reactivate the oil industry. However, the pace and depth of the adjustment will be constrained by uncertainty over the stability of any new administration, and in particular, how this might be impaired by probable demands from multilateral and bilateral lenders for politically difficult reforms. Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and other multilaterals (totalling US$46bn in 2020-23) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. This in itself will be a huge task for any administration. Meanwhile, PDVSA will need wholesale reform to open itself up to the foreign finance needed to increase output, a process that will require considerable political capital.
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
The authorities have not published complete official data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit this year to remain well into double digits as a percentage of GDP. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Under our expectation of substantial currency adjustment, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise dramatically in coming years; however, our forecasts assume that a combination of debt restructuring and deep fiscal adjustment will gradually bring the ratio under control. The process will be complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds, and all but one of PDVSA's bonds, are in arrears. Bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. A US appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary. However, the latest US sanctions forbid the transfer of Venezuelan assets. This will, for the time being, shield Citgo and its Caribbean facilities, which the US government now considers to be under Mr Guaidó's purview.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. However, a significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of the year-and a strong contraction in domestic demand-have had a temporary steadying effect, which has slowed hyperinflationary pressures and allowed the bolívar to stabilise to some extent in recent months. We expect monthly inflation to rise again in the short term, given that the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. However, given our assumption that a transitional government-which places a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation-will come to power, we do not currently project a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018 (although there are substantial political risks to this forecast). Instead, under a new government, we expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of an emergency macroeconomic stabilisation plan. The introduction of a new currency, a temporary peg or outright currency substitution in such a context is highly likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 18.5% in 2018, we expect further reductions in 2019-20. Our forecast of an economic recovery in 2021-23 assumes a political transition that is supported by international assistance, and produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of oil wealth. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, and we expect only a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of more than 65% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2019, reflecting the effect of hyperinflation on real wages, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also diminish, reflecting difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Moreover, power cuts and fuel shortages are now commonplace-particularly outside Caracas-owing to severe underinvestment in the country's power infrastructure. These have further damaged Venezuela's overall economic capacity. The dry season (January-April) will exacerbate power cuts.
Our forecast for a recovery in investment from 2020 assumes a political transition and a pick-up in oil investment. We expect oil output to bottom out at 650,000 barrels/day (b/d) by year-end, prevented from slipping any lower by PDVSA's joint-venture partners. In line with our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government later in 2019, oil production will start to recover in 2020, but even in 2023 it will still be well below 2m b/d, the average output in 2017.
Export volumes will start to recover in 2020 on the back of recovery in the oil sector, but a rise in domestic demand (which has been artificially constrained) will initially absorb some of the projected increase in oil output. Import demand will rise sharply in 2020. These factors will initially constrain the rebound of GDP, but we expect real GDP growth to gather pace in 2022-23.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were recently published by the BCV, but there is a significant gap between these and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions over the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. These have indicated some disinflation in recent months, with inflation falling below the hyperinflation threshold of 50% per month. Huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand persist, and we expect inflation to remain high for as long as the Maduro regime stays in power. On the basis of our assumption of regime change in the short term, we expect much tighter monetary policy and lower inflation, but supply bottlenecks and bouts of inflationary pressure are likely.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
Under our baseline forecast of political transition by end-2019, the introduction of a new currency (or outright currency substitution) to try to tackle inflation is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to predict. Our forecasts assume extremely large currency adjustments that restore some competitiveness to the local currency in real terms over time. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime has announced a loosening of currency controls. Access to dollars via formal means will remain difficult and we believe that the foreign-exchange system will stay highly controlled in practice. In this environment, a strong black-market exchange-rate premium is likely to re-emerge. At end-August, the official exchange rate was BsS22,160:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of almost BsS25,950:US$1. The premium was wide, although still small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
We have recently revised our current-account data in line with the BCV's publication of official figures for 2017-18. These show that Venezuela continued to post current-account surpluses in this period on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. However, we continue to project a shift into current-account deficit this year, in view of the collapse of export earnings stemming from US sanctions on the oil trade. This deficit will emerge despite the non-payment of interest on bonded debt ("savings" in excess of US$5bn in 2019 alone). We have also excluded repayments to Chinese lenders, to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data, on which our debt forecasts are based. Later in the forecast period, we expect exports to grow as oil production increases, but we also foresee a surge in imports, as Venezuela's own productive base has been severely eroded. These factors will keep the current account in deficit, although we expect the shortfall to narrow to a manageable level of around 3.5% of GDP towards the end of the forecast period.
We currently expect that a new administration will secure sufficient finance to stabilise the balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this outlook. It hinges on substantial IMF finance, rapid macroeconomic stabilisation, speedy resolution of a debt renegotiation process, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Muhammadu Buhari won a second and final four-year presidential term on February 23rd. The policy agenda he campaigned on did not involve considerable reform, only cosmetic improvements to the business environment.
The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This will create a potent mixture that will lead to frequent violent instability and directly affect key economic sectors.
Policy will be interventionist. Import bans on agricultural and manufactured goods will be widened to support local industry and farmers, and the Central Bank of Nigeria will maintain an overvalued official naira rate with which to channel cheap US dollars to preferred buyers.
The multiple-exchange-rate regime will not be dismantled under a Buhari administration; the arrangement is critical for making petrol subsidies affordable and underpins the government's interventionist approach to industrialisation.
Even though a multiple exchange-rate system will persist, non-official rates will converge and so in reality Nigeria will run a dual exchange-rate regime. Oil prices will be high enough to prevent a return to capital controls (as temporarily imposed in 2016), but import restrictions will be widened, especially for food.
Fiscal expenditure will remain dominated by recurrent spending, despite attempts to boost capital investment. Efforts to boost non-oil tax revenue will be constrained by weak bureaucratic capacity and low economic growth.
Constrained by a crippling infrastructure deficit, as well as tight monetary conditions and instability in key agricultural regions, economic growth will be well below levels needed to boost job creation and increase living standards. This will perpetuate instability in a vicious cycle.
Inflation will remain high over the forecast period (2019-23) amid expansionary fiscal policy and high food prices stemming from government efforts to limit imports and support local producers. This in turn will keep credit conditions tight; even with some relaxation of the policy rate from 2021, inflation will be running too high for sustained monetary loosening, and credit growth will generally be slow.
Exports will be flat in 2019 and fall in 2020 as global oil prices come under pressure, but imports will also fall. Imports and exports will expand in 2021-23 but a current-account surplus will be maintained throughout the forecast period.

Nigeria's business environment score will improve slightly but its global and regional rankings will worsen as the administration struggles with the reform process and other countries make more significant improvements.
Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2019-20: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector will remain characterised by joint-ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2021-23: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector remains a priority, but progress will be slow.
Policy towards foreign investment
2019-20: An attempt to sell the state's interest in oil joint ventures with multinationals will meet serious challenges (the policy has been around for years), with resistance in the legislature to the permanent loss of a revenue stream.
2021-23: Higher world oil prices and so easing fiscal pressures lessen the need to embark on a divestment programme. Energy companies will anyway be hesitant to increase their stake in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2019-20: Import bans are widened dramatically, but capital controls will not be necessary, barring another oil price crash.
2021-23: A premium between the overvalued official and parallel-market exchange rates persists.
Taxes
2019-20: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Value-added tax (VAT) is increased to fund a higher minimum wage, which will markedly increase the fiscal cost of the civil service.
2021-23: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation, particularly for offshore oilfields. The need for new consumer taxes is alleviated by higher world oil prices and, as a result, hydrocarbons revenue.
Financing
2019-20: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically following the completion of the 2019 elections, as local capital markets deepen (with greater foreign participation) and the banking sector develops.
2021-23: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market
2019-20: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2021-23: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure
2019-20: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints and is crowded out by other spending categories, including debt-servicing and higher public-sector wages. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2021-23: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness
2019-20: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2021-23: Research spending is likely to remain low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has almost wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2019-23: Political stability
Muhammadu Buhari won a presidential election in February 2019 and will remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. However, managing the country's myriad security threats will prove an insoluble challenge. The foremost reason for this is an overstretched military and police force, which will be unable to cope with simultaneous security crises. Security crises will in effect be triaged, with resources being deployed to whichever is seen to be the most pressing at any given time.
Conflict in the north-east between the government and two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), is also a pressing issue in the north-east, with Islamist fighters better equipped and capable than they have been in recent years. As this is one of Mr Buhari's voter strongholds, the president will be keen to reassert control over the situation. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east of Nigeria will remain a low-level conflict zone, albeit limited to the north-east of the country, and the campaign will divert security forces away from pockets of instability elsewhere. One such hotspot is just to the south, in the agricultural Middle Belt of Nigeria, where violent clashes between settled farmers and nomads competing for land and water resources have killed several thousand civilians in recent years. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis, but as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. Ultimately there is no foreseeable end to violence in the Middle Belt. Vigilantes will be used to make up for shortfalls in formal security personnel, but not be an effective substitute. Again, the direct effect of the conflict on the security situation will be localised, but the entire country will feel the secondary effects in the form of constricted food supply and, as a result, consumer prices.
Another localised conflict with countrywide consequences will be militant activity in the oil-producing south, where insurgents are demanding more hydrocarbons revenue to be kept locally for development. Reforming how federal revenue is allocated is a massive task and one that The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect to be achieved in the forecast period. Our assumption is that attacks by aggrieved militants and saboteurs on oil infrastructure will continue to be a major security problem in Delta state, with indirect consequences for the entire federation in the form of disrupted oil exports.
Given the fragility of Nigeria in terms of domestic security, conflicts will, at times, even penetrate into the administrative capital, Abuja, and the commercial capital, Lagos. Recently, adherents of an incarcerated religious Shia leader, Ibrahim Zakzaky, have been protesting for his release in Abuja, and several deadly clashes with the security forces have taken place. In a sign of how overwhelmed the government is, Mr Zakzaky was recently allowed to travel to India for medical treatment, which will temporarily defuse tensions. However, if he is not released, this is a crisis that will need further (and priority) attention from the security forces. In a more general sense, the military and the police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping across the country. Here, widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding into a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook.
Outlook for 2019-23: Election watch
The election in February 2019 reaffirmed a deep electoral divide between the north, which supports the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and southern Nigeria, a stronghold of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). In the next general election in 2023, custom dictates that the candidates of both main parties will be southerners, giving the PDP a chance to improve on abysmally low turnout there in the 2019 presidential vote. The contest will be the opposition's to win. Nigeria's economic outlook up to the next election does not point towards a material decrease in widespread poverty. Frustration with declining living standards and high levels of crime and instability will be directed at the APC, affording the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2019-23: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across land and sea borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat that they pose. Relations with South Africa have recently deteriorated over xenophobic attacks against Nigerians living in South Africa. Nigerian politicians have insisted that the authorities in South Africa do more to protect foreign residents. The South African authorities have long struggled to curb xenophobic violence, and serious bouts do occasionally occur, but although the issue is emotive, the issue is unlikely to undermine high-level ties.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil and become a bigger source of foreign investment. China will also remain a significant source of investment, but actual inflows will fall short of the headline-grabbing pledges made, given an extremely challenging local business environment. Nigeria will remain an important player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. For example, although Mr Buhari recently signed a continent-wide free trade agreement it is likely that protected sectors (notably in agriculture, where other countries would have a competitive advantage) will be shielded from foreign competition.
Outlook for 2019-23: Policy trends
Economic policies in Mr Buhari's second, final term will continue the interventionist trend that characterised his first. Measures to liberalise and unify foreign-exchange markets or move to more market-led pricing in the energy sector will not be pursued. An overvalued official naira rate is critical for maintaining fuel subsidies (over 90% of petrol is imported), and Mr Buhari will not willingly undo pump-price caps and risk a popular backlash. Although in practice very little foreign exchange is traded at the official rate, the existence of a multiple-exchange-rate system brings with it the risk of capital controls and will be off-putting to those acquiring illiquid assets in Nigeria, such as direct investments. Foreign direct investment will be kept well below Nigeria's potential as a result, with projected inflows equating to less than 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period. To defend foreign reserves and the official rate, and thereby try to build confidence, the CBN will progressively widen import restrictions in 2019-20 (the average oil price will fall in both years). Impetus to this policy will most probably come from a British court ruling that an Irish natural gas firm can apply to seize US$9bn in Nigerian government assets in the UK, equal to 20% of Nigeria's gross foreign reserves.
Elsewhere, efforts will be made to cleanse and reboot inefficient state-owned industries such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)-which dominates all segments of the oil sector-but no structural reforms will take place. There will be some effort to reduce the NNPC's stake in the upstream oil joint ventures that it has with international oil companies, but uncertainty about fiscal terms (with deep political divisions about how to distribute hydrocarbons revenue having stalled critical legislation) means that investor interest will be short of official expectations, and parliament will resist selling off key public assets cheaply. As a consequence, the NNPC will continue to dominate the oil sector, with the political elite working to direct the flow of resources to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies (as well as for illicit personal gain).
Outlook for 2019-23: Fiscal policy
We expect small fiscal deficits throughout the forecast period. The government wants to diversify its revenue base away from oil, and non-oil revenue will rise through efforts to collect overdue taxes and a probable increase in value-added tax (VAT) from 5% now to 8% in 2020 (as oil prices and revenue decline). Increases will be from an extremely low base however. Tax avoidance is widespread, and instability impedes collection in many parts of the country. Petrol subsidies (whereby losses incurred by the NNPC's retail arm are deducted from federal revenue) will be another drain, and budgeted revenue levels will be undermined by overambitious oil production targets. For example, in 2019 the government expects output of 2.3m barrels/day-a level not seen since the oil price slump, and one unobtainable given underinvestment and OPEC production quotas. In all, federally retained revenue is not expected to rise above 3.7% of GDP.
After expansion in 2018, spending will decline as a proportion of GDP in 2019 with a low capital budget and poor execution. Partly offsetting this will be higher spending on wages and public-sector benefits, including via the introduction of a new (increased) minimum wage. Generally, however, fiscal flexibility will be restricted by high levels of debt-servicing and pressing security needs. But with oil prices-and, as a result, revenue-under pressure and there being considerable political pressure to curb the fiscal deficit, we expect the spending/GDP ratio to dip again in 2020 and only increase materially as elections in 2023 approach. Altogether, we expect an average budget deficit averaging 1.9% of GDP in 2019-23.
Long-term public debt sustainability will remain in doubt. Central government debt is low as a proportion of GDP compared with other emerging markets, but it is set against an abnormally low revenue base. Debt service can take up to half of federal revenue, which is alarming even by heavily-indebted emerging market standards. A sovereign default is unlikely, but repayment difficulties are possible at state level, where revenue collection is weaker.
Outlook for 2019-23: Monetary policy
Monetary policy will concentrate on fostering an economic recovery. However, this will generate contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is minded towards boosting the supply side of the economy, but inflation is well above the targeted upper limit of 9%, and loosening in 2019-20 would risk capital outflows and naira stability at a time of low oil prices. Notwithstanding a 50-basis-point rate cut to 13.5% by the CBN in March (upheld in May and July), we do not expect rates to move much during 2019-20, keeping rates in Nigeria attractive to foreign investors as monetary policy in the US loosens. Our baseline forecast is for interest rates to fall from 2021 as inflation enters into a sustained downtrend, giving the CBN a chance to act on its growth-first strategy. We also expect that oil prices will rise during these years, driving higher foreign-exchange inflows.
Outlook for 2019-23: Economic growth
The economy will for the most part be mired in a low-growth cycle, although there will be improvements over time. In 2019-20 the economy will grow by an average of just 2.1%, held back by power shortages, insecurity, high inflation and tight credit conditions. With no room for fiscal activism, monetary policy is the main lever that can drive a recovery. In 2021-23 as global markets strengthen and inflation gradually decelerates-allowing for some monetary easing-the rate of growth will quicken to an average of 3.3%, although this remains well below potential.
From a sectoral viewpoint, agricultural growth will be lacklustre. Although boosting food production is a key government objective, weak infrastructure and violent competition for access to land in the fertile Middle Belt will continue to be severe impediments. Industrial production will be curtailed by militancy and labour agitation in the oil sector, and investment will be held back by uncertainty about future fiscal terms. Egina, a new offshore oilfield, will drive higher condensate output, but hydrocarbons production is not expected to return to levels prior to the 2015 commodity-price crash. That said, a private refinery coming on stream by 2021 will be a boost to downstream oil activity. The manufacturing sector will continue to struggle in the face of electricity shortages, as well as cheap goods from abroad, which are often smuggled into the country to bypass import bans. The services sector is less affected by instability and so will be a stronger contributor to growth than industry, but it will nonetheless be held back by protectionism (affecting trade) and the struggle in the communications sector to profitably roll out data services beyond urban hubs.
Outlook for 2019-23: Inflation
From a rate of 12.1% in 2018, average inflation will remain elevated in 2019, at 11.5%, as an increase in the minimum wage combines with disruptions to local food supply and widening import restrictions on consumer goods. In 2020 inflation at 11.3% will remain well above the CBN's targeted ceiling of 9% as widening foreign exchange restrictions continue to lead to higher prices. We also expect a 3-percentage-point rise in VAT in that year, prompted by lower oil prices (and fiscal revenue coming under pressure). With base effects from this fading, core inflation will gradually ease over the rest of the forecast period, bringing the headline rate down with it to an average of 8.8% in 2023. In combination with hardening foreign exchange restrictions on food imports, conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-will prevent a faster slide.
Outlook for 2019-23: Exchange rates
We expect the multiple-exchange-rate system to persist throughout 2019-23, with an official rate used for government business and a more market-determined rate applicable to investors and exporters, which will be broadly in line with retail rates and the parallel market. Such a system allows the government to subsidise sectors deemed important for economic or political reasons, including the NNPC, which budgets for petrol imports at the official rate. The central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, has proven willing to adopt unconventional measures to keep the naira stable, which he argues is essential to avoid an inflationary spike and capital flight. Measures to defend the naira as oil prices decline in 2019-20 will include foreign-exchange restrictions to curb what has been a surge in import demand, but there will not be a need for capital controls (as were introduced temporarily in 2016). Progressively easier global monetary conditions during these years will support the naira through portfolio inflows, predominantly into fixed-income securities. Higher global crude prices thereafter will continue to support the official rate. In real terms, currency stability (for both the official and more market-determined rates) means real appreciation of the naira against trading partners as inflation remains high. For this reason there is a downside risk of policymakers opting to devalue or allowing more market-determined rates to weaken in order to regain international competitiveness. However, the CBN's industrial strategy (the central bank has long had similarities with a development agency) is focused on supplying the domestic market, so such an eventuality is not forecast.
Forecasting the naira
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of our data presentations, as it is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. For example, the current market-determined rate, known as the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (Nafex), has only been in full operation since April 2017, making historical calculations challenging. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2019-23: External sector
The profile of export earnings will move in tandem with oil production and price trends. Falling oil prices in 2019 will be counteracted by rising output, but in 2020 the steeper price effect will cause earnings to fall. Higher global prices in 2021-23 and output gains (with a new mega-refinery coming on stream in around 2021, which we expect to be export-oriented, will return exports to growth.
Nigeria's government actively promotes import-substitution through foreign-exchange restrictions on certain goods (mainly manufactures and agricultural produce). A succession of such restrictions implemented in 2019 will cause imports to flat-line in that year-despite fast growth in the first half-and fall in 2020. As the economy gathers pace in 2021-23 and global oil prices rise (refinery capacity is low, and Nigeria imports much of its petrol needs), imports will then grow faster.
Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation in the oil sector will keep the services and primary income balances firmly in deficit. Workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency, albeit dipping in 2020 as growth falters in the US (home to a large Nigerian diaspora). Overall, the current-account surplus will average 1.5% of GDP in 2019-20, widening to 2.5% of GDP in 2021-23 as oil prices strengthen and the new refinery comes on stream.
